In addition, we include financial data for operations that are not directly related to our business segments in Other Operations. The collective group of businesses uses Lincoln Financial Group as its marketing identity.

Certain GAAP policies, which significantly affect the determination of financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, are summarized in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s results. Interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 Certain amounts reported in prior periods consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current period. Effective in the third quarter of 2024, we collapsed the amortization of deferred gain (loss) on business sold through reinsurance line item, reclassifying the deferred gain amortization to other revenues and presenting the amortization of deferred loss within commissions and other expenses. For prior periods, the amortization of deferred gain (loss) on business sold through reinsurance is presented on a net basis within other revenues. 

The variable annuities level of aggregation includes RILA products, which are indexed variable annuities. The fixed annuities level of aggregation represents deferred fixed annuities. We have excluded amounts reported in Other Operations from our disaggregated disclosures that are attributable to the indemnity reinsurance agreements with Protective Life Insurance Company Protective and Swiss Re Life Health America, Inc Swiss Re as these contracts are fully reinsured, run-off institutional pension business in the form of group annuity and the results of certain disability income business.

Our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity AFS securities decreased by billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As discussed further below, we do not believe the unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, required an impairment recognized in earnings as: (i) we did not intend to sell these fixed maturity AFS securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (iii) the difference in the fair value compared to the amortized cost was due to factors other than credit loss. Based upon this evaluation as of September 30, 2024, management believes we have the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations (e.g., insurance premiums, fee income and investment income) to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety without requiring the sale of our impaired securities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with our corporate bond, U.S. government bond, state and municipal bond and foreign government bond securities were attributable primarily to rising interest rates and widening credit spreads since purchase. We performed a detailed analysis of the financial performance of the underlying issuers and determined that we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each impaired security. 
 
 Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security. Securities rated investment grade (those rated BBB- or higher by S P Global Ratings S P or Baa3 or higher by Moody s Investors Service Moody s )) are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, of the fair value of our corporate bond portfolio was rated investment grade. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the portion of our corporate bond portfolio rated below investment grade had an amortized cost of billion, and a fair value of billion and billion, respectively. Based upon the analysis discussed above, we believe that as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we would have recovered the amortized cost of each corporate bond. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with our mortgage-backed securities MBS and asset-backed securities ABS were attributable primarily to rising interest rates and widening credit spreads since purchase. We assessed for credit impairment using a cash flow model that incorporates key assumptions including default rates, severities and prepayment rates. We estimated losses for a security by forecasting the underlying loans in each transaction. The forecasted loan performance was used to project cash flows to the various tranches in the structure, as applicable. Our forecasted cash flows also considered, as applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts and other independent market data. Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses of the security given the performance of the underlying collateral compared to our subordination or other credit enhancement, we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each impaired security.

 Structured Securities 
 
 Through our investment activities, we make passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which we are not the manager. These structured securities include our ABS, residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ). We have not provided financial or other support with respect to these VIEs other than our original investment. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs due to the relative size of our investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs and the level of credit subordination that reduces our obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits. Our maximum exposure to loss on these structured securities is limited to the amortized cost for these investments. We recognize our variable interest in these VIEs at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For information about these structured securities, see Note 3 .

 Less: Counterparty thresholds Maximum collateral potentially required to post 
 
 Certain of our CDS agreements contain contractual provisions that allow for the netting of collateral with our counterparties related to all of our collateralized financing transactions that we have outstanding. If these netting agreements were not in place, our counterparties would have been required to post million of collateral as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on various derivative contracts and reflect assumptions regarding the credit or non-performance risk. The non-performance risk is based upon assumptions for each counterparty s credit spread over the estimated weighted average life of the counterparty exposure, less collateral held. As of September 30, 2024, the non-performance risk adjustment was zero. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by entering into agreements with financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA Master Agreement. We are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating ISDA agreements. Under nearly all ISDA agreements, our insurance subsidiaries have agreed to maintain certain financial strength ratings. A downgrade below these levels could result in termination of derivative contracts, at which time any amounts payable by us would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts. In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have entered into a credit support annex requiring either party to post collateral when net exposures exceed pre-determined thresholds. These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating. The amount of such exposure is essentially the net replacement cost or market value less collateral held for such agreements with each counterparty if the net market value is in our favor. We did not have any exposure as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.

 reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Reinsurance Company Ltd. Fortitude Re ), an authorized Bermuda reinsurer with reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurer status in Indiana, to reinsure certain blocks of in-force UL with secondary guarantees ULSG ), MoneyGuard and fixed annuity products, including group pension annuities. Fortitude Re represents our largest reinsurance exposure as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The first agreement was structured as a coinsurance treaty between us and Fortitude Re for the ULSG and fixed annuities blocks. As significant insurance risk was transferred for ULSG products and life-contingent annuities, amounts recoverable from Fortitude Re were billion and billion as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We reported a deferred loss on the transaction of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We amortized million and million of the deferred loss during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Annuities that are not life-contingent do not contain significant insurance risk; therefore, we reported deposit assets for these contracts of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The second agreement was structured as coinsurance with funds withheld for the MoneyGuard block; however, as we retained significant insurance risk under the agreement, we reported deposit assets of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. In this coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreement, we as the ceding company withhold, and therefore retain, the assets backing the deposit assets. billion and billion in support of reserves associated with the Fortitude Re transaction in a funds withheld arrangement as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, which consisted of the following (in millions):

 Valuation Methodologies and Associated Inputs for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 
 
 The following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Considerable judgment is required to develop these assumptions used to measure fair value. Accordingly, the estimates shown are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a one-time, current market exchange of all of our financial instruments. 
 
 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 
 The fair value of mortgage loans on real estate, excluding mortgage loans accounted for using the fair value option, is established using a discounted cash flow method based on credit rating, maturity and future income. The ratings for mortgages in good standing are based on property type, location, market conditions, occupancy, debt-service coverage, LTV, quality of tenancy, borrower and payment record. The fair value for impaired mortgage loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The inputs used to measure the fair value of our mortgage loans on real estate, excluding mortgage loans accounted for using the fair value option, are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

(1) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments, unless otherwise noted.

From the table above, we have excluded Level 3 fair value measurements obtained from independent, third-party pricing sources. We do not develop the significant inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and the information regarding the significant inputs is not readily available to us. Independent broker-quoted fair values are non-binding quotes developed by market makers or broker-dealers obtained from third-party sources recognized as market participants. The fair value of a broker-quoted asset or liability is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant as we do not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset or liability. Significant increases or decreases in any of the quotes received from a third-party broker-dealer may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 
 
 The embedded derivative liability associated with Fortitude Re was excluded from the above table. As discussed in Note 7 , this embedded derivative liability was created through a coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreement where the investments supporting the reinsurance agreement were withheld by and continue to be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This reinsurance-related embedded derivative is valued as a total return swap with reference to the fair value of the investments held by us. Accordingly, the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation of the reinsurance-related embedded derivative are a component of the investments supporting the reinsurance agreement that are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 Changes in any of the significant inputs presented in the table above would have resulted in a significant change in the fair value measurement of the asset or liability as follows: 
 
 Investments An increase in the liquidity/duration adjustment input would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement. 
 Indexed annuity contracts embedded derivatives For direct embedded derivatives, an increase in the lapse or mortality inputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement. 
 MRBs Assuming our MRBs are in a liability position: an increase in our lapse, non-performance risk or mortality inputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement, except for policies with guaranteed death benefit GDB riders only, in which case an increase in mortality inputs would have resulted in an increase in the fair value measurement.

million, after-tax. Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or of the Company s maximum possible loss exposure on such matters. 
 
 For other matters, we are not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. We are often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and update our accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
 
 Among other matters, we are presently engaged in litigation, including relating to cost of insurance rates Cost of Insurance and Other Litigation ), as described below. No accrual has been made for some of these matters. Although a loss is believed to be reasonably possible for these matters, for some of these matters, we are not able to estimate a reasonably possible amount or range of potential liability. An adverse outcome in one or more of these matters may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, but, based on information currently known, management does not believe those cases are likely to have such an impact.

INTRODUCTION 

Executive Summary 
 
 We are a holding company that operates multiple insurance and retirement businesses through subsidiary companies. We sell a wide range of wealth accumulation, wealth protection, group protection and retirement income products and solutions through our four business segments: 
 
 Annuities; 
 Life Insurance; 
 Group Protection; and 
 Retirement Plan Services 
 
 We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments. See Part I Item 1. Business in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of our business segments and products. 
 
 In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess 
 73 

T able of Contents 

the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 1 6 . Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses. Certain items are excluded from operating revenue and income (loss) from operations because they are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide investors with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our businesses. 
 
 We provide information about our segments and Other Operations operating revenue and expense line items, key drivers of changes and historical details underlying the line items below. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth, see Forward-Looking Statements Cautionary Language above, Part I Item 1A.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Investments Investment Valuation in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 1 3 herein. 
 
 Derivatives 
 
 Derivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes. We hedge certain portions of our exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, basis risk, commodity risk and credit risk by entering into derivative transactions. We also purchase and issue financial instruments that contain embedded derivative instruments. See Policyholder Account Balances below for information on embedded derivatives. Assessing the effectiveness of hedging and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates 
 
 We carry our derivative instruments at fair value, which we determine through valuation techniques or models that use market data inputs or independent broker quotations. The fair values fluctuate from period to period due to the volatility of the valuation inputs, including but not limited to swap interest rates, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads and correlations, some of which are significantly affected by economic conditions. The effect to revenue is reported in realized gain (loss) and such amount along with the associated federal income taxes is excluded from income (loss) from operations of our segments. 
 
 For more information on derivatives, see Note 1 in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 5 herein. For more information on market exposures associated with our derivatives, including sensitivities, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Future Contract Benefits 
 
 Future contract benefits represent liability reserves that we have established and carry based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. 
 
 Liability for Future Policy Benefits 
 
 Liability for future policy benefits LFPB represents the reserve amounts associated with non-participating traditional life insurance contracts and limited payment life-contingent annuity contracts that are calculated to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. Establishing adequate reserves for our obligations to policyholders requires assumptions to be made that are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required. Significant assumptions include mortality rates, morbidity and policyholder behavior (e.g., persistency) and withdrawals. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the actuarial assumptions to best estimate future premium and benefit cash flows cash flow assumptions and projection models used in estimating these liabilities and update these assumptions as needed (excluding the claims settlement expense assumption that is locked-in at inception) in the calculation of the net premium ratio. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. In measuring our LFPB, we establish cohorts, which are groupings of long-duration contracts. On a quarterly basis, we retrospectively update the net premium ratio at the cohort level for actual experience. For all contract cohorts issued after January 1, 2021, interest is accrued on LFPB at the single-A interest rate on the contract cohort inception date. For contract cohorts issued prior to January 1, 2021, interest remains accruing at the original discount rate in effect on the contract cohort inception date due to the modified retrospective transition method. We also remeasure the LFPB using the single-A interest rate as of the end of each reporting period. 
 
 Liability for Future Claims 
 
 Future contract benefits include reserves for long-term life and disability claims associated with our Group Protection segment. These reserves use actuarial assumptions primarily based on claim termination rates, offsets for other insurance including social security and long-term disability incidence and severity assumptions. Such cash flow assumptions are subject to the comprehensive review process discussed above. We remeasure the liability for future claims using a single-A interest rate as of the end of each reporting period. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. 
 
 Universal Life Insurance Products with Secondary Guarantees 
 
 We issue UL-type contracts where we provide a secondary guarantee to the policyholder. The policy can remain in force, even if the base policy account balance is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met. These guaranteed benefits require an additional liability that is calculated based on the application of a benefit ratio (calculated as the present value of total expected benefit payments over the life of the contract from inception divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract). These secondary guarantees are reported within future contract benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The level and direction of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the benefit ratio and the level of assessments associated with the contracts. Cash flow assumptions incorporated in a benefit ratio in measuring these additional liabilities for other insurance benefits include mortality rates, morbidity, policyholder behavior (e.g., persistency) and withdrawals based principally on generally accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the cash flow assumptions and projection models used in estimating these liabilities and update these assumptions in the calculation of the benefit ratio. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. 
 
 For additional information on future contract benefits, see Note 11 . 
 
 Market Risk Benefits 
 
 MRBs are contracts or contract features that provide protection to the policyholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk upon the occurrence of a specific event or circumstance, such as death, annuitization or periodic withdrawal. An MRB can be in either an asset or a liability position. Our MRB assets and MRB liabilities are reported at fair value separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 We issue variable and fixed annuity contracts that may include various types of guaranteed living benefit GLB and guaranteed death benefit GDB riders that we have accounted for as MRBs. For contracts that contain multiple riders that qualify as MRBs, the MRBs are valued on a combined basis using an integrated model. We have entered into reinsurance agreements to cede certain GLB and GDB riders where the reinsurance agreements themselves are accounted for as MRBs or contain MRBs. We therefore record ceded MRB assets 
 76 

T able of Contents 

and ceded MRB liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements. We report ceded MRBs associated with these reinsurance agreements in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Net amount at risk NAR represents the amount of GLB or GDB in excess of a policyholder s account balance at the balance sheet date. Underperforming markets increase our exposure to potential benefits with the GLB and GDB riders. A contract with a GDB rider is in the money if the policyholder s account balance falls below the GDB. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, 5 and 27 , respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GDB rider were in the money. A contract with a GLB rider is in the money if the policyholder s account balance falls below the present value of GLB payments, assuming no full surrenders. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, 13 and 33 , respectively, of all in-force contracts with a GLB rider were in the money. However, the only way the policyholder can realize the excess of the present value of benefits over the account balance of the contract is through a series of withdrawals or income payments that do not exceed a maximum amount. If, after the series of withdrawals or income payments, the account balance is exhausted, the policyholder will continue to receive a series of annuity payments. The account balance can also fluctuate with market returns on a daily basis resulting in increases or decreases in the excess of the present value of benefits over account balance. 
 
 Many policyholders have both a GLB and GDB present on the same policy. The total NAR represents the greater of GLB NAR and GDB NAR for each policy as only one benefit can be exercised in practice. Details underlying the NAR, net of reinsurance, (in millions) were as follows: 
 
 Annuities Retirement Plan Services As of September 30, As of September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 GLB NAR 1,236 2,929 1 2 GDB NAR 540 3,696 2 7 Total NAR 1,721 6,256 3 9 
 
 Change in the fair value of MRB assets and liabilities is reported in market risk benefit gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), except for the portion attributable to the change in non-performance risk, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) OCI ). Change in the fair value of ceded MRB assets and liabilities, including the changes in our counterparties non-performance risks, is reported in market risk benefit gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 
 MRBs are valued based on a stochastic projection of risk-neutral scenarios that incorporate a spread reflecting our non-performance risk. Ceded MRBs are valued based on a stochastic projection of risk-neutral scenarios that incorporate a spread reflecting our counterparties non-performance risk. The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include assumptions for capital markets, lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, risk margin and administrative expenses. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical data and actuarial judgments. The assumption for our own non-performance risk and our counterparties non-performance risk for MRBs and ceded MRBs, respectively, are determined at each valuation date and reflect our risk and our counterparties risks of not fulfilling the obligations of the underlying liability. The spread for the non-performance risk is added to the discount rates used in determining the fair value from the net cash flows. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these MRBs and update these assumptions on a prospective basis as needed. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. For information on fair value inputs, see Note 13 . See Annual Assumption Review below for more information.

Volatility assumptions vary by fund due to the benchmarking of difference indices. Mortality Increase / (Decrease) (Decrease) / Increase Increase / (Decrease) Mortality represents the estimated probability of when an individual belonging to a particular group, categorized according to age or some other factor such as gender, will die. Mortality contracts with only GDB rider Increase / (Decrease) Increase / (Decrease) (Decrease) / Increase Mortality represents the estimated probability of when an individual belonging to a particular group, categorized according to age or some other factor such as gender, will die. Lapse Higher / Lower (Decrease) / Increase Increase / (Decrease) Lapse assumption represents the estimated probability of a contract surrendering during a year, thereby forgoing any future benefits. Benefit utilization Higher / Lower Increase / (Decrease) (Decrease) / Increase Benefit utilization assumption of guaranteed withdrawals represents the estimated percentage of policyholders that utilize the guaranteed withdrawal feature. 
 
 We use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to selected risk caused by changes in equity markets and interest rates associated with GLB and GDB riders that are available in our variable annuity products and accounted for as MRBs. Our hedge program focuses on generating sufficient income to fund future claims with a goal of maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting capital. We utilize options and total return swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, and futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices, as well as interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency futures. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 5 . 
 
 As part of our hedge program, equity market and interest rate conditions are monitored on a daily basis. We rebalance our hedge positions based upon changes in these factors as needed. While we actively manage our hedge positions, these positions may not completely offset changes in the fair value of our GLB and GDB riders caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities, realized market volatility, policyholder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or our ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with our desired risk and return trade-off. 
 
 The following table presents our after-tax estimates of the potential instantaneous effect to net income (loss) that could result from sudden changes that may occur in equity markets and interest rates (in millions) and excludes the net cost of operating the hedge program. The amounts represent the difference between the change in GLB and GDB riders and the change in the fair value of the underlying hedge instruments. These estimates are based upon the balance as of September 30, 2024, net of reinsurance, and the related hedge instruments in place as of that date.

 The actual effects of the results illustrated in the table above could vary significantly depending on a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control, and consideration should be given to the following: 
 
 The analysis is only valid as of September 30, 2024, due to changing market conditions, policyholder activity, hedge positions and other factors; 
 The analysis assumes instantaneous shifts in the capital market factors and no ability to rebalance hedge positions prior to the market changes; 
 The analysis assumes constant exchange rates and implied dividend yields; 
 Assumptions regarding shifts in the market factors, such as assuming parallel shifts in interest rates, may be overly simplistic and not indicative of actual market behavior in stress scenarios; 
 It is very unlikely that one capital market sector (e.g., equity markets) will sustain such a large instantaneous movement without affecting other capital market sectors; and 
 The analysis assumes that there is no tracking or basis risk between the funds and/or indices affecting the GLB and GDB riders and the instruments utilized to hedge these exposures. 
 
 For additional information on MRBs, see Note 8. 
 
 Policyholder Account Balances 
 
 Policyholder account balances include the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability includes UL and VUL and investment-type annuity products where account balances are equal to deposits plus interest credited less withdrawals, surrender charges, asset-based fees and policyholder administration charges (collectively known as policyholder assessments ), as well as amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our indexed universal life insurance IUL and indexed annuity products. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying our reserves and embedded derivatives and update assumptions as needed. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. 
 
 Our indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect a fixed interest rate return or a return where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S P 500 Index or other indices. The value of the variable portion of the policyholder s account balance varies with the performance of the underlying variable funds chosen by the policyholder. Policyholders may elect to rebalance among the various accounts within the product at renewal dates. At the end of each indexed term, which can be up to six years, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by establishing different participation rates, caps, spreads or specified rates, subject to contractual guarantees. We purchase and sell index options that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our policyholders, such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset period. The mark-to-market of the options held generally offsets the change in value of the embedded derivative within the contract, both of which are recorded as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification TM 
 require that we calculate fair values of index options we may purchase or sell in the future to hedge policyholder index allocations in future reset periods. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase or sell in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indicators of volatility and interest rates. Changes in the fair values of these liabilities are included as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). For more information on indexed product derivative results, see Note 17 . 
 
 For additional information on the liability for policyholder account balances, see Note 10 . 
 
 Reinsurance Recoverables 
 
 Reinsurance recoverables are generally measured and recognized consistent with the assumptions and methodologies used to project the future performance of the underlying direct business as discussed in the Future Contract Benefits and Policyholder Account Balances sections above. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models 
 79 

T able of Contents 

and update assumptions as needed. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. In addition, we consider the potential impact of counterparty credit risks related to the reinsurance recoverable by estimating an allowance for credit losses using a probability of loss model approach to estimate expected credit losses for reinsurance recoverables. For additional information on our allowance for credit losses on reinsurance-related assets, see Note 8 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Annual Assumption Review 
 
 During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models used in estimating MRBs, our reserves and embedded derivatives. For more information on our comprehensive review, see Note 1 in our 2023 Form 10-K. Details underlying the effect to net income (loss) from our annual assumption review (in millions) were as follows: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Income (loss) from operations: Annuities 1 (12) Life Insurance 8 (156) Group Protection (1) 24 Retirement Plan Services Excluded from income (loss) from operations 208 (36) Net income (loss) 216 (180) 
 
 The impacts of our annual assumption review were driven primarily by the following: 
 
 2024 
 For Life Insurance, the favorable impact was driven by updates to capital market assumptions on reinsured blocks of MoneyGuard business and other items, partially offset by unfavorable updates to policyholder behavior assumptions on reinsured blocks of MoneyGuard business. 
 For Group Protection, the unfavorable impact was driven by updates to disability claim termination rate assumptions, partially offset by favorable updates to life waiver incurred assumptions. 
 For excluded from income (loss) from operations, the favorable impact, related to net annuity product features, was driven by model enhancements. 
 
 2023 
 For Annuities, the unfavorable impact was driven by updates to mortality assumptions. 
 For Life Insurance, the unfavorable impact was driven by updates to policyholder lapse behavior and mortality assumptions, partially offset by the favorable impact of a 50-basis-points increase in our long-term new money investment yield assumption. 
 For Group Protection, the favorable impact was driven by updates to long-term disability and life waiver claim termination rate assumptions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact due to updates to long-term disability social security offset assumptions. 
 For excluded from income (loss) from operations, the unfavorable impact, related to net annuity product features, was driven by updates to mortality and policyholder lapse behavior assumptions and other items, partially offset by a favorable impact from updates to volatility and policyholder GLB utilization behavior assumptions. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2024, we will perform our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024, on all of our reporting units. For more information on goodwill, see Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Notes 1 and 9 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, the deferred income tax assets and liabilities for items recognized differently in its financial statements from amounts shown on its income tax returns and the federal income tax expense. Determining these amounts requires analysis and interpretation of current tax laws and regulations. Management exercises judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax assets and liabilities. These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Legislative 
 80 

T able of Contents 

changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, modifications or new regulations, administrative rulings, or court decisions could increase or decrease our effective tax rate. 
 
 The application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable. Judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including: the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any future prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an approximate 1.5 billion deferred tax asset related to net unrealized losses on fixed maturity available-for-sale AFS securities. In the assessment of the future realizability of this deferred tax asset, management concluded that its tax planning strategy to hold these securities to recovery was prudent and feasible as these unrealized losses were caused by factors other than credit loss, and we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery and collect all of the contractual cash flows. 
 
 Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, will be realized. 
 
 For risks related to establishing a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Assumptions and Estimates We may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in our 2023 Form 10-K.

The coinsurance with funds withheld investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities classified as AFS with changes in fair value recorded in OCI. Since the corresponding and offsetting changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the coinsurance with funds withheld investment portfolio are recorded in realized gain (loss), volatility can occur within net income (loss). See Note 7 for more information. 
 (4) For information on the sale of our wealth management business, including the statutory capital benefit, see Note 1 . 
 (5) Includes certain legal accruals of (12) million in the third quarter of 2023 and (114) million primarily related to the settlement of cost of insurance litigation in the first quarter of 2024.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Net income decreased due primarily to the following: 
 
 Loss in net annuity product features in 2024 compared to gain in 2023 driven by unfavorable changes in interest rates in 2024 compared to favorable changes in 2023, partially offset by favorable changes in equity markets in 2024 compared to unfavorable changes in 2023, driving MRB-related impacts, partially offset by favorable changes in the fair value of GLB hedge instruments in 2024 compared to unfavorable changes in 2023 attributable to the impact of capital markets. 
 Unfavorable changes in the fair value of reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, trading securities and certain mortgage loans driven by the fair value of the embedded derivative related to the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 Loss in net life insurance product features in 2024 compared to gain in 2023 driven by mark-to-market losses on hedges associated with VUL products. 
 Higher credit loss-related adjustments on our mortgage loans on real estate and fixed maturity AFS securities. 
 
 The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Favorable impact from our annual assumption review in 2024 compared to unfavorable impact in 2023. 
 Lower investment losses driven by intent to sell impairment in 2023 on fixed maturity AFS securities as part of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 Growth in average account balances and improvement in our total loss ratio in our Group Protection segment. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Net income increased due primarily to the following: 
 
 Lower investment losses driven by intent to sell impairment in 2023 on fixed maturity AFS securities as part of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 Gain on other non-financial assets due to the sale of our wealth management business in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Favorable impact from our annual assumption review in 2024 compared to unfavorable impact in 2023. 
 Growth in average account balances and improvement in our total loss ratio in our Group Protection segment. 
 
 The increase in net income was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Higher expenses in other items driven by a legal accrual in the first quarter of 2024, severance expense related to initiatives that realign the workforce and transaction costs related to the sale of our wealth management business in the second quarter of 2024.

 (1) Insurance premiums include primarily our income annuities that have a corresponding offset in benefits. Benefits include primarily changes in income annuity reserves driven by insurance premiums. 
 (2) Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services, which are subject to market volatility and have a comparable offset in commissions and other expenses; and the net settlement related to certain reinsurance transactions, which has a corresponding offset in net investment income and interest credited. On May 6, 2024, we closed the previously announced sale of our wealth management business. See Note 1 for more information. 
 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following: 
 
 Higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account balances. 
 Lower policyholder liability remeasurement loss driven by the impact from our annual assumption review. 
 
 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, which more than offset impacts from higher average fixed account balances and improving portfolio yields from the current interest rate environment. The lower net investment income, net of interest credited, was experienced in certain reinsured portfolios that have a corresponding increase in other revenues and decrease in benefits. 
 Higher commissions and other expenses, net of broker-dealer expenses, driven by higher trail commissions resulting from higher average daily variable account balances. 
 
 The increase in income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also partially offset by following: 
 
 Higher federal income tax expense due to the separate account dividends-received deduction in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Higher commissions and other expenses due to higher broker-dealer expenses in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of a balance sheet true-up in preparation for the close of the sale of the wealth management business.

Additional Information 
 
 New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. 
 
 The other component of net flows relates to the retention of new business and account balances. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account balances caused by full surrenders, deaths and other contract benefits. These outflows as a percentage of average gross account balances were 11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 9 for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 
 Our fixed annuities and registered index-linked annuities RILA have discretionary fixed and indexed crediting rates that reset on an annual or periodic basis and may be subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain these annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time crediting rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Market Conditions Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Market Conditions Increases in interest rates may negatively affect our profitability, capital position and the value of our investment portfolio and may also result in increased contract withdrawals and Part II Item 7A.

 (1) Presented net of GLB and GDB hedge allowance. 
 
 We charge policyholders mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are a function of the rates priced into the product and the average daily variable account balances. Average daily variable account balances are driven by net flows and variable fund returns. Charges on GLB riders are assessed based on a contractual rate that is applied either to the account balance or the guaranteed amount. We allocate a portion of these fees to support the cost of hedging GLB and GDB riders. For more information, see Note 16 . We may collect surrender charges when our fixed and variable annuity policyholders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period to protect us from premature withdrawals.

 (2) Represents net investment income on the required statutory surplus for this segment and includes the effect of investment income on alternative investments for such assets that are held in the portfolios supporting statutory surplus versus the portfolios supporting product liabilities. See Consolidated Investments Alternative Investments below for more information on alternative investments. 
 
 A portion of our investment income earned is credited to the policyholders of our deferred fixed annuity products, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts, and what we credit to our fixed annuity policyholders accounts, including the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts. Changes in commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, investment income on alternative investments and surplus investment income can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

 DAC Deferrals As a percentage of sales/deposits 3.8 3.7 3.4 3.5 
 
 Commissions and other expenses that result directly from and are essential to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business are deferred to the extent recoverable and are amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts using the groupings and actuarial assumptions consistent with those used for calculating the related policyholder liability balances. Certain types of commissions, such as trail commissions that are based on account balances, are expensed as incurred rather than deferred and amortized. Broker-dealer expenses that vary with and are related to sales are expensed as incurred and not deferred and amortized. Fluctuations in these expenses correspond with fluctuations in other revenues.

 A portion of the investment income earned for this segment is credited to policyholder accounts. Statutory reserves will typically grow at a faster rate than account balances because of reserve requirements. Investments allocated to this segment are based upon the statutory reserve liabilities and are affected by various reserve adjustments, including financing transactions providing relief from reserve requirements. These financing transactions lead to a transfer of investments from this segment to Other Operations. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments and what we credit to our policyholders accounts. Investment income partially offsets the earnings effect of the associated growth of our policy reserves. Commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums and investment income on alternative investments can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, and, therefore, may contribute to investment income results that are not indicative of the underlying trends.

These reserves are affected by changes in expected future trends of assessments and benefits causing remeasurements. Generally, we experience higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims.

 Higher commissions and other expenses driven by higher trail commissions resulting from higher average daily variable account balances. 
 
 The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account balances. 
 
 Additional Information 
 
 Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented and terminating over the course of the year. 
 New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account balances caused by plan sponsor terminations and participant withdrawals. These outflows as a percentage of average account balances were 13 fo r the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 12 for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 99 

T able of Contents 

Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business (as presented on our Net Flows By Market table below as Multi-Fund and other ), which are among our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs. The proportion of these products to our total account balances wa s 13 a nd 16 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Due to this overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels. 
 
 Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time crediting rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Market Conditions Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, Part I Item 1A.

 Our fee income is primarily composed of expense assessments that we charge to cover insurance and administrative expenses, and mutual fund fees earned for services we provide to our mutual fund programs. Fee income is primarily based on average account balances, both fixed and variable, which are driven by net flows and the equity markets. Fee income is also driven by non-account balance-related items such as participant counts. We may collect surrender charges when our fixed and variable annuity policyholders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period to protect us from premature withdrawals.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Loss from operations for Other Operations decreased due primarily to higher other revenues due to the effect of market fluctuations on assets held as part of certain compensation plans, which increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease during the corresponding period in 2023. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Loss from operations for Other Operations decreased due primarily to higher other revenues due to the effect of market fluctuations on assets held as part of certain compensation plans, which increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a less significant increase during the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in loss from operations was partially offset by higher other expenses driven by higher costs pertaining to business operations. 
 
 Net Investment Income and Interest Credited 
 
 We utilize an internal formula to determine the amount of capital that is allocated to our business segments. Investment income on capital in excess of the calculated amounts is reported in Other Operations. If our business segments require increases in statutory reserves, surplus or investments, the amount of excess capital that is retained by Other Operations would decrease and net investment income would be negatively affected. 
 
 Write-downs for impairments decrease the recorded value of investments owned by the business segments. These write-downs are not included in the income from operations of our business segments. When impairment occurs, assets are transferred to the business segments portfolios and will reduce the future net investment income for Other Operations. Statutory reserve adjustments for our business segments can also cause allocations of investments between the business segments and Other Operations.

The majority of our interest credited relates to our reinsurance operations sold to Swiss Re Life Health America, Inc. Swiss Re in 2001. A substantial amount of the business was sold through indemnity reinsurance transactions, which is still recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The interest credited corresponds to investment income earnings on the assets we continue to hold for this business. There is no effect to income or loss in Other Operations or on a consolidated basis for these amounts because interest earned on the blocks that continue to be reinsured is passed through to Swiss Re in the form of interest credited.

 (4) Consists primarily of reimbursements to Other Operations from the Life Insurance segment for the use of proceeds from certain issuances of senior notes that were used as long-term structured solutions, net of expenses incurred by Other Operations for its access to a financing facility and issuance of letters of credit LOCs ). 
 
 Interest and Debt Expense 
 
 Our current level of interest expense may not be indicative of the future due to, among other things, the timing of the use of cash, the availability of funds from our inter-company cash management program and the future cost of capital.

 Investment Objective 
 
 Investments are an integral part of our operations. We follow a balanced approach to investing for both current income and prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income, net of income tax, to meet our obligations to customers, as well as other general liabilities. This balanced approach requires the evaluation of expected return and risk of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach is important to our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Investment Portfolio Composition and Diversification 
 
 Fundamental to our investment policy is diversification across asset classes. Our investment portfolio, excluding cash and invested cash, is composed of fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, real estate (either wholly owned or in joint ventures) and other long-term investments. We purchase investments for our segmented portfolios that have yield, duration and other characteristics that take into account the liabilities of the products being supported. 
 
 We have the ability to maintain our investment holdings throughout credit cycles because of our capital position, the long-term nature of our liabilities and the matching of our portfolios of investment assets with the liabilities of our various products.

Fixed Maturity AFS Securities 
 
 In accordance with the fixed maturity AFS accounting guidance, we reflect stockholders equity as if unrealized gains and losses were actually recognized and consider all related accounting adjustments that would occur upon such a hypothetical recognition of unrealized gains and losses. Such related balance sheet effects include adjustments to future contract benefits, policyholder account balances and deferred income taxes. Adjustments to each of these balances are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI ). For instance, deferred income tax balances are adjusted because unrealized gains or losses do not affect actual taxes currently paid. 
 
 The quality of our fixed maturity AFS securities portfolio, as measured at estimated fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity AFS securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire fixed maturity AFS security portfolio (in millions) was as follows:

 (1) Based upon the rating designations determined and provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC or the major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings Fitch ), Moody s Investors Service Moody s and S P Global Ratings S P )). For securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies are not equivalent, the second lowest rating assigned is used. For those securities where ratings by the major credit rating agencies are not available, which does not represent a significant amount of our total fixed maturity AFS securities, we base the ratings disclosed upon internal ratings. The average credit quality was A- as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Comparisons between the NAIC designations and rating agency designations are published by the NAIC. The NAIC assigns securities quality designations and uniform valuations, which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements. The NAIC designations are similar to the rating agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for marketable bonds. NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated Baa3 or higher by Moody s, or rated BBB- or higher by S P and Fitch) by such ratings organizations. However, securities designated NAIC 1 and 2 could be deemed below investment grade by the rating agencies as a result of the current risk-based capital RBC rules for residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS and CMBS for statutory reporting. NAIC designations 3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment grade (rated Ba1 or lower by Moody s, or rated BB+ or lower by S P and Fitch). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, 97 of the total fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position were investment grade. Our gross unrealized losses recognized in OCI on fixed maturity AFS securities as of September 30, 2024, decreased by 1.5 billion since December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 204 million of gross losses on fixed maturity AFS securities, which were primarily related to portfolio rebalancing and sales that support our reinsurance funds withheld agreements where the investment results are passed directly to the reinsurers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,

T able of Contents 

we recognized 119 million of gross losses on fixed maturity AFS securities, which were primarily related to sales driven by the regional banking crisis. For further information on our unrealized losses on fixed maturity AFS securities, see Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity AFS Securities below. 
 
 We regularly review our fixed maturity AFS securities for declines in fair value that we determine to be impairment-related, including those attributable to credit risk factors that may require a credit allowance. We do not believe the unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, required an impairment recognized in earnings as: (i) we did not intend to sell these fixed maturity AFS securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (iii) the difference in the fair value compared to the amortized cost was due to factors other than credit loss. This conclusion is consistent with our asset-liability management process. Management considered the following as part of the evaluation: 
 
 The current economic environment and market conditions; 
 Our business strategy and current business plans; 
 The nature and type of security, including expected maturities and exposure to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk; 
 Our analysis of data from financial models and other internal and industry sources to evaluate the current effectiveness of our hedging and overall risk management strategies; 
 The current and expected timing of contractual maturities of our assets and liabilities, expectations of prepayments on investments and expectations for surrenders and withdrawals of annuity contracts and life insurance policies; 
 The capital risk limits approved by management; and 
 Our current financial condition and liquidity demands. 
 
 We recognized (14) million and (40) million of credit loss benefit (expense) on our fixed maturity AFS securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and (1) million and (17) million, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2023. In order to determine the amount of credit loss, we calculated the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover. To determine the recoverability, we considered the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including, but not limited to, the following: 
 
 Historical and implied volatility of the security; 
 The extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; 
 Adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area; 
 Failure, if any, of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments; and 
 Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. 
 
 For information on credit loss impairment on fixed maturity AFS securities, see Notes 1 , 3 and 17 herein and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 As reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we had 141.1 billion of liabilities for future obligations under insurance policies and contracts, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, which exceeded investments and cash and invested cash, which totaled 137.8 billion as of September 30, 2024. If it were necessary to liquidate fixed maturity AFS securities prior to maturity or call to meet cash flow needs, we would first look to those fixed maturity AFS securities that are in an unrealized gain position, which had a fair value of 26.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, rather than selling fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position. The amount of cash that we have on hand at any point in time takes into account our liquidity needs in the future, other sources of cash, such as the maturities of investments, interest and dividends we earn on our investments and the ongoing cash flows from new and existing business. For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value for all private placement securities was 21.5 billion and 20.6 billion, respectively, representing 16 and 17 of total investments, respectively.

Composition by Industry Categories of our Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity AFS Securities 
 
 When considering unrealized gain and loss information, it is important to recognize that the information relates to the position of securities at a particular point in time and may not be indicative of the position of our investment portfolios subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, because the timing of the recognition of realized investment gains and losses through the selection of which securities are sold is largely at management s discretion, it is important to consider the information provided below within the context of the overall unrealized gain or loss position of our investment portfolios. These are important considerations that should be included in any evaluation of the potential effect of securities in an unrealized loss position on our future earnings. The composition by industry categories of all fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position (in millions) as of September 30, 2024, was as follows:

 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, alternative investments included investments in 361 and 352 different partnerships, respectively, and the portfolio represented approximately 3 of total investments. The partnerships do not represent off-balance sheet financing and generally involve several third-party partners. Some of our partnerships contain capital calls, which require us to contribute capital upon notification by the general partner. These capital calls are contemplated during the initial investment decision and are planned for well in advance of the call date. The capital calls are not material in size and are not material to our liquidity. Alternative investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are included in other investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 We earn investment income on our general account assets supporting fixed annuity, term life, whole life, UL, interest-sensitive whole life and the fixed portion of retirement plan and VUL products. The profitability of our fixed annuity and life insurance products is affected by our ability to achieve target spreads, or margins, between the interest income earned on the general account assets and the interest credited to the policyholder on our average fixed account balances, including the fixed portion of variable. Net investment income and the interest rate yield table each include commercial mortgage loan prepayments and bond make-whole premiums, alternative investments and contingent interest and standby real estate equity commitments. These items can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and, therefore, can provide results that are not indicative of the underlying trends. 
 
 Commercial Mortgage Loan Prepayment and Bond Make-Whole Premiums 
 
 Prepayment and make-whole premiums are collected when borrowers elect to call or prepay their debt prior to the stated maturity. A prepayment or make-whole premium allows investors to attain the same yield as if the borrower made all scheduled interest payments until maturity. These premiums are designed to make investors indifferent to prepayment.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity and capital as described below. 
 
 When considering our liquidity, it is important to distinguish between the needs of our insurance subsidiaries and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC is largely dependent upon the dividend capacity of its insurance and other subsidiaries as well as their ability to advance or repay funds to it through inter-company borrowing arrangements, which may be affected by factors influencing the subsidiaries capital position, as discussed further below. Based on the sources of liquidity available to us as discussed below, we currently expect to be able to meet the holding company s ongoing cash needs. 
 
 Capital 
 
 Capital refers to our long-term financial resources to support the operations of our businesses, to fund long-term growth strategies and to support our operations during adverse conditions. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity and capital as described below. 
 
 Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may materially affect our business operations and results of operations and may adversely affect our subsidiaries capital position that may cause them to retain more capital, which may pressure their ability to pay dividends to LNC, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. We believe we have appropriate capital to operate our business in accordance with our strategy. For more information, see Subsidiaries Capital below. 
 
 For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section and that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see Forward-Looking Statements Cautionary Language above, Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. 
 
 Consolidated Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital are insurance premiums and fees, investment income, maturities and sales of investments, issuance of debt or other types of securities and policyholder deposits. We also have access to alternative sources of liquidity as discussed below. Our primary uses are to pay policy claims and benefits, to fund commissions and other general operating expenses, to purchase investments, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to our common and preferred stockholders, to repurchase our common stock and to repay debt. Our operating activities provided (used) cash of (2.2) billion and (206) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Holding Company Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
 
 The primary sources of liquidity and capital at the holding company level are dividends, return of capital and interest payments from subsidiaries, augmented by holding company short-term investments, bank lines of credit and the ongoing availability of long-term public financing under an effective shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue, in unlimited amounts, securities, including debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and depository shares. These sources support the general corporate needs of the holding company, including its common and preferred stock dividends, common stock repurchases, interest and debt service, funding of callable securities, acquisitions and investment in core businesses.

 The table above focuses on significant and recurring cash flow items and excludes the effects of certain financing activities, including the periodic issuance and retirement of debt, issuance of preferred stock, cash flows related to our inter-company cash management program and certain investing activities, including capital contributions to subsidiaries. These activities are discussed below. Taxes have been eliminated from the analysis due to a tax sharing agreement among our primary subsidiaries resulting in a modest effect on net cash flows at the holding company. Also excluded from this analysis is the modest amount of investment income on short-term investments of the holding company and employee stock exercise activity related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans. See Part IV Item 15(a)(2) Financial Statement Schedules Schedule II Condensed Financial Information of Registrant in our 2023 Form 10-K for the holding company cash flow statement. For information regarding limits on the dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay without prior approval, see Part II Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Holding Company Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital Restrictions on Subsidiaries Dividends in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company LNL made a 929 million extraordinary dividend in the form of investments to LNC for the purpose of the initial capitalization of LPINE. See Introduction Executive Summary above and Subsidiaries Capital below for more information about LPINE. 
 
 Subsidiaries Capital 
 
 Our insurance subsidiaries must maintain certain regulatory capital levels. We utilize the RBC ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our insurance subsidiaries. The RBC ratio is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries, as a reduction in our insurance subsidiaries surplus will affect their RBC ratios and dividend-paying capacity. For additional information on RBC ratios, see Part I Item 1. Business Regulatory Insurance Regulation Risk-Based Capital in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Our insurance subsidiaries regulatory capital levels are affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. For instance, our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees subject to the NAIC RBC framework require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline XXXVIII AG38 ), respectively. Our insurance subsidiaries employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to reinsurance captives or reinsurance subsidiaries. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner and free up capital the insurance subsidiaries can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to the holding company. We use long-dated LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves. Included in the LOCs issued as of September 30, 2024, was 1.7 billion of long-dated LOCs issued to support inter-company reinsurance agreements for UL products containing secondary guarantees. For information on the LOCs, see the credit facilities table in Note 14 in our 2023 Form 10-K. Our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have also issued long-term notes of 3.8 billion to finance a portion of the excess reserves associated with our term and UL products with secondary guarantees as of September 30, 2024; of this amount, 3.1 billion involve exposure to variable interest entities. For information on these long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 5 in our 2023 Form 10-K. We have also used the proceeds from senior note issuances of 875 million to execute long-term structured solutions primarily supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees. LOCs and related capital market solutions lower the capital effect of term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees. 
 
 Statutory reserves and RBC requirements for variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders and guaranteed benefits on VUL policies are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and interest rates and are affected by the level of account balances relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market 
 119 

T able of Contents 

performance is non-linear during any given reporting period. Our insurance subsidiaries cede a portion of the variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders to Lincoln National Reinsurance Company (Barbados) Limited LNBAR through a modified coinsurance agreement. Our variable annuity hedge program mitigates the risk to LNBAR from guaranteed benefit riders and continues to focus on generating sufficient income to fund future claims with a goal of maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting capital. LNL also uses a partial hedge that mitigates potential capital volatility from guaranteed benefits on VUL policies. Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and supporting derivatives. In December 2022, LNC issued a long-term note to a non-affiliated variable interest entity in exchange for notes of like principal and duration classified as AFS securities. LNC contributed the securities to LNBAR to address asset value volatility based on market conditions. Under the current terms of the note facility, the maximum permissible principal amount of the note is 1.5 billion, the full amount of which was outstanding as of September 30, 2024. There are no impacts to the LNC Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the set-off right provided in the note facility. For more information, see Note 5 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Changes in equity markets may also affect the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries. We may decide to reallocate available capital among our insurance subsidiaries, including our captive reinsurance or reinsurance subsidiaries, which would result in different RBC ratios for our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the equity markets can affect the value of our variable annuity and variable universal life insurance separate accounts. When the market value of our separate account assets increases, the statutory surplus within our insurance subsidiaries also increases. Contrarily, when the market value of our separate account assets decreases, the statutory surplus within our insurance subsidiaries may also decrease, which will affect RBC ratios, and in the case of our separate account assets becoming less than the related product liabilities, we must allocate additional capital to fund the difference. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, LNC contributed 929 million of investments and 22 million in cash to LPINE, a wholly owned subsidiary of LNC and a licensed Bermuda-based life and annuity reinsurance company, in support of an inter-company reinsurance agreement with LNL. As a Class E insurer, LPINE is subject to the Bermuda Monetary Authority s solvency and capital requirements. See Introduction Executive Summary above for more information about LPINE. 
 
 LNC made capital contributions in cash to other subsidiaries of zero and 5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to zero and 5 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 
 On May 6, 2024, we closed the previously announced sale of all of the ownership interests in the subsidiaries of the Company that comprised the Company s wealth management business operated through LFN to Osaic. We received 723 million in cash, and the sale provided approximately 650 million of statutory capital benefit that we primarily used to increase LNL s RBC ratio. We also used a portion of the proceeds to reduce our leverage ratio. For more information on the sale of our wealth management business, see Note 1 . 
 
 Debt 
 
 Although our subsidiaries currently generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of our normal operations, periodically LNC may issue debt to maintain ratings and increase liquidity, as well as to fund internal growth, acquisitions and the retirement of its debt.

On March 14, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of 350 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.852 Senior Notes due 2034. We used a portion of the net proceeds to fund the repayments of 47 million of our term loan due December 3, 2024. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering to fund the repayment of the Company s 3.35 Senior Notes due 2025 on or prior to their maturity, and possible repurchases of other of our outstanding debt securities, as well as to pay fees and expenses in respect of the foregoing. 
 
 During June 2024, we repaid 53 million of our term loan due December 3, 2024, using available cash to deleverage the balance sheet. On July 18, 2024, we refinanced this term loan into a 150 million term loan due July 16, 2027. 
 
 LNC made interest payments to service debt to third parties of 85 million and 231 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 63 million and 217 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods in 2023.

 Return of Capital to Common Stockholders 
 
 One of our primary goals is to provide a return to our common stockholders through share price accretion, dividends and stock repurchases. In determining dividends, the Board of Directors takes into consideration items such as current and expected earnings, capital needs, rating agency considerations and requirements for financial flexibility. The amount and timing of share repurchases depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of dividends from our subsidiaries and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. For additional information regarding share repurchases, see Part II Item 2(c) below.

 Alternative Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Inter-Company Cash Management Program 
 
 To promote effective short-term cash management strategies, we utilize an inter-company cash management program between LNC and participating subsidiaries under which each entity can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. As of September 30, 2024, the holding company did not have an outstanding balance. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. For our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiary, the borrowing and lending limit is currently 3 of the insurance company s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2 of its admitted assets as of its most recent year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC.

Facility Agreement for Senior Notes Issuance 
 
 LNC entered into a facility agreement in 2020 with a Delaware trust that gives LNC the right over a 10-year period to issue, from time to time, up to 500 million of 2.330 Senior Notes to the trust in exchange for a corresponding amount of U.S. Treasury securities held by the trust. By agreeing to purchase the 2.330 Senior Notes in exchange for U.S. Treasury securities upon exercise of the issuance right, the trust will provide a source of liquid assets for the Company. The issuance right will be exercised automatically in full upon our failure to make certain payments to the trust, if the failure to pay is not cured within 30 days, or upon certain bankruptcy events involving LNC. We are also required to exercise the issuance right in full if our consolidated stockholders equity (excluding AOCI) falls below a minimum threshold (which was 2.75 billion as of September 30, 2024, and is subject to adjustment from time to time in certain cases) and upon certain other events described in the facility agreement. For additional information, see Note 14 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank 
 
 Our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Indianapolis FHLBI ). Membership allows LNL access to the FHLBI s financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets, agency securities or U.S. Treasury securities. Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBI s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LNL. As of September 30, 2024, LNL had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of 7.0 billion under the FHLBI facility and maximum available borrowing based on qualifying assets of 5.0 billion. As of September 30, 2024, LNL had outstanding borrowings of 3.2 billion under this facility reported within payables for collateral on investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lincoln Life Annuity Company of New York LLANY is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY with an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of 750 million. Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBNY s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LLANY. As of September 30, 2024, LLANY had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. For additional information, see Payables for Collateral on Investments in Note 3 . 
 
 Repurchase Agreements and Securities Lending Programs 
 
 Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries had access to 2.75 billion of committed repurchase facilities, of which 25 million was utilized, as of September 30, 2024. Our insurance subsidiaries, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can also access liquidity through securities lending programs. As of September 30, 2024, our insurance subsidiaries had securities pledged under securities lending agreements with a carrying value of 185 million. The cash received in our securities lending programs is typically invested in cash and invested cash or fixed maturity AFS securities. For additional information, see Payables for Collateral on Investments in Note 3 . 
 
 Collateral on Derivative Contracts 
 
 Our cash flows associated with collateral received from counterparties (when we are in a net collateral payable position) and posted with counterparties (when we are in a net collateral receivable position) change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. As of September 30, 2024, we were in a net collateral payable position of 7.1 billion compared to 5.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to return collateral to counterparties or post collateral to counterparties. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash to provide as collateral to counterparties, we have alternative sources of liquidity. In addition to the liquidity from repurchase agreements and FHLB facilities discussed above, we also have a 500 million liquidity facility that is contingent upon interest rates and the five-year revolving credit facility discussed in Note 14 in our 2023 Form 10-K. Alternative liquidity sources include uncommitted repurchase agreements and selling highly liquid assets in the general account. For additional information, see Credit Risk in Note 5.

 If our current financial strength ratings or credit ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements and/or certain repurchase agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our derivative counterparties, there is a termination event if the long-term credit ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S P/Moody s) or if the financial strength

ratings of LNL drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S P/Moody s). For certain repurchase agreements, there is a termination event if the long-term credit ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S P/Moody s) or if the financial strength ratings of LNL drop below BBB+/Baa1 (S P/Moody s). In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Covenants and Ratings A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. For information on these market risks, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

On September 4, 2024, the court granted preliminary approval of the provisional settlement, which is still subject to final approval. 
 
 Reference is made to the lawsuit captioned Donald C. Meade v. Lincoln National Corporation, Ellen Cooper, Dennis Glass, and Randal Freitag, previously discussed in our First Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q and Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. On October 23, 2024, the court granted Local 295 IBT Employer Group Pension Trust Fund s motion for appointment as lead plaintiff.

Freitag, Deirdre P Connelly, William H. Cunningham, Reginald E. Davis, Eric G. Johnson, Gary C. Kelly, M. Leanne Lachman, Dale LeFebvre, Janet Liang, Michael F. Mee, Lynn M. Utter and Patrick S. Pittard , both of which were previously disclosed in our Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. On September 26, 2024, the court entered an order that, among other things, the Hollin case and the Wiersum case be consolidated for all purposes under the matter name In Re. Lincoln National Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation (No.: 2:24-cv-02713) and that all proceedings and deadlines in this matter be stayed until thirty days after resolution of all motions to dismiss (including the exhaustion of all related appeals) in the Donald C.

 Kelly Grink v. Virtua Health and Lincoln National Corporation et al ., No. 1:24-cv-09919, is a putative class action filed on October 18, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Plaintiffs Kelly Grink and Diane Trump are participants in Virtua Health s defined contribution plans. Plaintiffs seek to represent all current and former participants or beneficiaries of Virtua s 401(k) savings plan and 403(b) retirement program who invested in the plan s fixed annuity option in the six years prior to the filing of this lawsuit. Lincoln offers a fixed annuity investment option to plan participants through its group annuity contract with the plans. Lincoln also provides recordkeeping and administration services to the plans. Plaintiffs allege that the Virtua defendants acted in breach of their fiduciary duty including by maintaining the plans investment in the Lincoln stable value fund when other investment providers are alleged to have provided superior alternatives at substantially lower cost. Plaintiffs allege that Lincoln acted as a fiduciary with respect to the fixed annuity investment option and was a party in interest to a prohibited transaction under ERISA. The action seeks unspecified relief against Lincoln. We are vigorously defending this matter. 
 
 Reference is made to Lincoln National Life Insurance Company v. Township of Radnor , previously disclosed in our Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. The trial of this matter began in October 2024 and is scheduled to continue in November 2024. 
 
 See Note 14 in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements for further discussion regarding these matters and other contingencies. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the factors set forth in Part I Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Cautionary Language, you should carefully consider the risks described under Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. Such risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.

As of September 30, 2024, our remaining security repurchase authorization was 714 million. The security repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. The amount and timing of share repurchases depends on key capital ratios, rating agency expectations, the generation of free cash flow and an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of capital. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement or Rule 10b5-1 plan.
