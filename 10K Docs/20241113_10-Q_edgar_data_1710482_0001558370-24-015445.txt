Each loan is evaluated at least annually with more frequent evaluation of more severely criticized loans. The indicators represent the rating for loans as of the date presented is based on the most recent credit review performed. Internal risk rating definitions are: Pass : These include satisfactory loans that have acceptable levels of risk. Special Mention : Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that requires close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. These credits do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant further adverse classification. Substandard : A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful : Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard asset with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loss : Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be received in the future. The Company has a portfolio of smaller homogenous loans that are not individually risk rated and include residential permanent and construction mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and consumer installment loans. For these loans, management uses payment status

The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for loan credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company may provide concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to minimize the economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. The Company made loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the loan was million which represents of the Real Estate Loans - Commercial loan segment.

 on all SBA 7(a) loans. The Company generally offers SBA 7(a) loans within a range of thousand to million. The Company holds rights to service the guaranteed portion of SBA loans sold in the secondary market. Loan servicing rights are capitalized at estimated fair value when acquired through the origination of loans that are subsequently sold with the servicing rights retained. Loan servicing rights are amortized to servicing income on loans sold approximately in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. The value of loan servicing rights at the date of the sale of loans is estimated based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows using key assumptions for servicing income and costs and expected prepayment rates on the underlying loans. The estimated fair value is periodically evaluated for impairment by comparing actual cash flows and estimated future cash flows from the loan servicing assets to those estimated at the time that the loan servicing assets were originated. Fair values are estimated using expected future discounted cash flows based on current market rates of interest. For purposes of measuring impairment, the loan servicing rights must be stratified by one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans. The Company stratifies its capitalized loan servicing rights based on product type and term of the underlying loans. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount, if any, by which the amortized cost of the loan servicing rights exceeds their fair value. Impairment, if deemed temporary, is recognized through a valuation allowance to the extent that fair value is less than the recorded amount. Under the SBA 7(a) program, the loans carry an SBA guaranty for up to of the loan. Typical maturities for this type of loan vary but can be up to ten years. SBA 7(a) loans are fixed or adjustable rate loans based on the Prime Rate. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s SBA 7(a) loan servicing portfolio, which is not included in the Company s consolidated financial statements, totaled million. At September 30, 2024, SBA servicing rights of thousand were recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The SBA servicing rights' fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with an average discount rate of and average conditional prepayment rates of . There was valuation allowance on loan servicing rights at September 30, 2024. Collateral Dependent Loans In accordance with ASC 326, loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. The Company designates individually evaluated loans on nonaccrual status as collateral dependent loans, as well as other loans that management of the Company designates as having higher risk and loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. The measurement of loss associated with collateral dependent loans can be based on either the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the Company s collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal, of one year or less, conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process of construction, or if an appraisal of the property is more than one-year-old and not solely based on observable market comparables, or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, then a Level 3 valuation is considered to measure the fair value. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal, of one year or less, if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business s financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company had collateral dependent loan totaling million in outstanding principal with no recorded reserve as of September 30, 2024. The Company had collateral dependent loans with a recorded reserve as of December 31, 2023. Other Real Estate Owned OREO OREO is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value using observable market data, the Company records the property as Level 2. When an appraised value using observable market data is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the property as Level 3 valuation. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and expensed against current earnings. The Company had OREO as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes presented in Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-Q. Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate results of operations or trends in operations for any future periods. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information provides a better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. Non-GAAP measures used in this report consist of core net income, core non-interest income, core return on average assets (annualized), core return on average equity (annualized), core dilutive earnings per share, tax-equivalent net interest income and tax-equivalent net interest margin. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. Where the non-GAAP financial measure is used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as reconciliation to that comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a statement of the company s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure, can be found within this discussion and analysis.

Overview We are a bank holding company headquartered in Reston, Virginia primarily serving the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The material business operations of our organization are performed through the Bank. As a result, the discussion and analysis within this section primarily relate to activities conducted at the Bank. As with most community banks, the Bank derives a significant portion of its income from interest received on loans and investments. The Bank s primary source of funding is deposits, both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing. To account for credit risk inherent in all loans, the Bank maintains an allowance for loan credit losses to absorb lifetime losses on existing loans. The Bank establishes and maintains this allowance by recording a provision for credit losses against earnings. In addition to net interest income, the Bank also generates income through service charges on deposits, insurance commission income, merchant services fee income, swap fee income and gain on sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans. In order to maintain its operations, the Bank incurs various operating expenses which are further described within the Results of Operations later in this section. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total consolidated assets of 2.27 billion, total loans net of unearned income of 1.82 billion, total deposits of 1.94 billion and total shareholders equity of 243.1 million.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP, as well as general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements may reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently rely more extensively on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such may have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Our most significant accounting policies are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024.

 Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Overview Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11.7 million to 12.3 million compared to 0.7 million for the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the Company selling certain lower-yielding available-for-sale investment securities with a total par value of 161.2 million and selling 21.4 million of BOLI contracts during the third quarter of 2023 (the Restructuring ), which resulted in a non-recurring, after-tax loss of 14.6 million. Core net income (Non-GAAP), defined as net income less the after tax loss stemming from the Restructuring, was 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.87, an increase when compared to the 0.05 reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.5 million or 3.8 compared to the same period of 2023, driven primarily by the increase in costs of interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the increase in yield on interest-earning assets. The Company recorded a 0.7 million recovery of credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 2.5 million recovery of credit losses for the nine month ended September 30, 2023. Additional discussion of the provision for credit losses is included below under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Non-interest income was 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Core non-interest income (Non-GAAP), defined as reported non-interest income excluding the 17.1 million loss stemming from the bond sale portion of the Restructuring, was 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 28.3 increase in non-interest income compared to non-interest income (Non-GAAP) of 440 thousand was primarily attributable to a 459 thousand increase in gains recorded on the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans due to increased sale activity. Non-interest expense increased 602 thousand or 2.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 322 thousand non-recurring reversal of a litigation reserve during the third quarter of 2023 and previously disclosed non-recurring expenses totaling 138 thousand incurred during the first quarter of 2024. The first quarter 2024 non-recurring expenses were incurred in connection with a strategic opportunity that was explored and ultimately did not materialize. Excluding the effects of the 322 thousand reversal in 2023 and non-recurring expenses totaling 138 thousand incurred during 2024, non-interest expense increased 142 thousand or 0.6 during the adjusted nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to adjusted nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in professional fees and data processing expense, partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefit expense. The increase in professional fees was due to increased contract costs and services. The increase in data processing fees was primarily due to contractual increases and volume based activity. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was due to lower incentive accruals and higher direct loan origination costs when compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense as result of mark-to-market fluctuations on the Company s nonqualified deferred compensation plan NQDC ). The ROAA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 0.73 and 0.04 , respectively. Core ROAA (Non-GAAP), defined as average assets divided by the annualized core net income (Non-GAAP) by the average assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.87 . The ROAE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 6.97 and 0.40 , respectively. Core ROAE (Non-GAAP), defined as average equity divided by the annualized net income by the average equity, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 9.25 .

 (1) Core net income reflects net income adjusted for the non-recurring tax effected loss recognized on the sale of available-for-sale securities and non-recurring tax expense associated with the surrender of the Company s BOLI policies in July 2023. Tax benefit (expense) is calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . (2) Core non-interest income reflects non-interest income adjusted for the pre-tax loss recognized on the sale of available-for-sale securities. (3) Includes tax benefit (expense) calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . (4) Core earnings per share diluted is calculated by dividing core net income by basic weighted average shares outstanding and diluted weighted average shares outstanding, respectively, for each period presented. (5) Core return on average assets (annualized) is calculated by dividing annualizing core net income by average assets for each period presented. (6) Core return on average equity (annualized) is calculated by dividing annualizing core net income by average equity for each period presented. 
 Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management s discussion contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information provides a better comparison of the impact of the Restructuring where the Company sold certain lower-yielding available-for-sale investment securities with a total par value of 161.2 million and surrendered 21.4 million BOLI contracts, resulting in a non-recurring, after-tax loss of 14.6 million. The sale of the available-for-sale securities did not impact book-value-per-share as the after-tax loss of 13.5 million was already reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2023. The remaining 1.1 million after-tax loss stems from the taxation on the gain associated with the expected cash payout from the BOLI policies. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. Non-GAAP measures used in management discussion consist of the following: Non-interest income, income before taxes, income tax expense, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted), return on average assets (annualized), return on average equity (annualized). These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. Please refer to the Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures table for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

 (1) Income and yields for all periods presented are reported on a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . (2) The Company did not have any loans on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. (3) Tax-equivalent net interest margin adjusts for differences in tax treatment of interest income sources. The entire tax-equivalent adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets. Interest expense and the related cost of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the tax-equivalent components. Tax-equivalent net interest margin as presented above is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, is a financial measure that the Company believes provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Tax-equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on

 certain securities and loans, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The following table, Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income, reconciles net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income, which is a non-GAAP measure. Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income 

Nine months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 GAAP Financial Measurements: Interest Income - Loans 71,289 63,355 Interest Income - Securities and Other Interest-Earning Assets 10,849 10,816 Interest Expense - Deposits 41,484 33,590 Interest Expense - Borrowings 3,674 2,125 Total Net Interest Income (GAAP) 36,980 38,456 Non-GAAP Financial Measurements: Add: Tax Benefit on Tax-Exempt Interest Income - Loans 115 184 Add: Tax Benefit on Tax-Exempt Interest Income - Securities 7 11 Total Tax Benefit on Tax-Exempt Interest Income (1) 122 195 Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) 37,102 38,651 

 (1) Tax benefit was calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . Net interest income decreased 1.5 million or 4.0 on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was driven by the increase in the costs of interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the increase in yield on interest-earning assets. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, the net interest margin was 2.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which more than offset the increase in yields on loans, investments, and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to a 94 basis points increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits resulting from the repricing of the Company s time deposits coupled with an increase in rates offered on money market, NOW and savings deposit accounts since the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the overall cost of interest-bearing liabilities during the first three quarters of 2024 relative to the same period of the prior year is largely due to Federal Reserve Bank rate increases totaling 5.25 between March 2022 and July 2023. The loan portfolio s yield for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.24 compared to 4.78 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 46 basis points was primarily attributable to an increase in yield on the Company s variable rate loans as a result of an increase in interest rates subsequent to September 30, 2023 coupled with a higher weighted average yield on loans originated since the third quarter of 2023. The yield on interest-bearing deposits due from banks for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.50 compared to 5.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 27 basis points was primarily due to a higher federal funds rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period of 2023. The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on tax-equivalent net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to volume.

 (1) Income and yields for all periods presented are reported on a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . (2) The Company did not have any loans on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. Interest Income Interest income increased by 7.9 million or 10.6 to 82.3 million on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 74.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by both an increase in rates and volume on interest-earning assets. The increase in rate on interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to the Company s loan portfolio. The increase in volume of average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to interest-bearing deposits due from banks and the Company s loan portfolio. Fully tax-equivalent interest income on loans increased by approximately 7.9 million as a result of an increase in rate and volume. Average loans increased 44.5 million between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to origination volume in the investor real estate and residential loan portfolios subsequent to September 30, 2023. That was partially offset by loan payoffs in commercial owner-occupied real estate loans subsequent to September 30, 2023. Fully tax-equivalent interest income on investment securities decreased by approximately 2.3 million primarily as a result of a decrease in volume. Average investment securities decreased approximately 145.7 million between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, primarily due to the sale of certain low-yielding investment securities in July 2023, and to a lesser extent, the amortization of securities. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased by 2.3 million as a result of an increase in volume. Average interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased approximately 50.0 million between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, primarily due to the redeployment of proceeds from the sale of certain low-yielding investment securities in July 2023 to other higher-yielding assets, including interest-bearing deposits in other banks.

 Interest Expense Interest expense increased by 9.4 million to 45.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 35.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in rates on deposits and increase in volume on borrowings. The increase in rates on deposits was primarily a result of the repricing of the Company s time deposits coupled with an increase in rates offered on deposit accounts subsequent to September 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in benchmark interest rates. The increase in volume on borrowings was primarily a result of the Company s utilization of BTFP advances. Provision for Credit Losses The Company recorded a 0.7 million recovery of provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 2.5 million recovery of provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The recovery of and provision for credit losses for the current period that is directly attributable to the funded and unfunded loan portfolio was (1.1) million and 0.4 million, respectively. The recovery of provision for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of changes in the Company s loss driver analysis, resulting from a periodic review of our assumptions. The review resulted in a higher modeled probability of default, changes in prepayment and curtailment rates, and an assessment of management s considerations of existing economic versus historical conditions combined with the continued strong credit performance of our loan portfolio segments. See Asset Quality below for additional information on the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Non-interest Income The Company s recurring sources of non-interest income consist primarily of interchange income, gains on sale of government guaranteed loans, service charges on deposit accounts and insurance commissions. Generally speaking, loan fees are included in interest income on the loan portfolio and not reported as non-interest income. The following table summarizes non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Nine months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Service charges on deposit accounts Overdrawn account fees 61 55 Account service fees 199 184 Other service charges and fees Interchange income 271 304 Other charges and fees 203 373 Bank owned life insurance 224 Losses on sale of available-for-sale securities (17,316) Net gains on premises and equipment 1 16 Insurance commissions 357 310 Gain on sale of government guaranteed loans 509 50 Non-qualified deferred compensation plan asset gains, net 298 112 Other operating income 91 124 Total non-interest income 1,990 (15,564) Non-interest income increased 17.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As previously disclosed, the Company recorded a loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale bonds of 17.1 million during the third quarter 2023. Core non-interest income (Non-GAAP) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.5 million. The 28.3 increase in non-interest income compared to core non-interest income (Non-GAAP) of 440 thousand was primarily attributable to a 459 thousand increase in gains recorded on the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans due to increased sale activity.

 Non-interest Expense Generally, non-interest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining customer relationships and providing banking services. The largest component of non-interest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Non-interest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy and equipment expenses, data processing expenses, professional fees, advertising expenses and other general and administrative expenses, including FDIC assessments, and Virginia state franchise taxes. The following table summarizes non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Nine months ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Salaries and employee benefits expense 14,583 14,929 Occupancy expense of premises 1,343 1,363 Furniture and equipment expenses 902 882 Advertising expense 290 239 Data processing 1,595 1,374 FDIC insurance 730 771 Professional fees 750 154 State franchise tax 1,718 1,785 Bank insurance 179 174 Vendor services 474 407 Supplies, printing, and postage 109 103 Director costs 593 629 Other operating expenses 597 451 Total non-interest expense 23,863 23,261 Non-interest expense increased 602 thousand or 2.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 322 thousand non-recurring reversal of a litigation reserve during the third quarter of 2023 and previously disclosed non-recurring expenses totaling 138 thousand incurred during the first quarter of 2024. The first quarter 2024 non-recurring expenses were incurred in connection with a strategic opportunity that was explored and ultimately did not materialize. Excluding the effects of the 322 thousand reversal in 2023 and non-recurring expenses totaling 138 thousand incurred during 2024, non-interest expense increased 142 thousand or 0.6 during the adjusted nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to adjusted nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in professional fees and data processing expense, partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefit expense. The increase in professional fees was due to increased contract costs and services. The increase in data processing fees was primarily due to contractual increases and volume based activity. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was due to lower incentive accruals and higher direct loan origination costs when compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense as result of mark-to-market fluctuations on the Company s NQDC. Income Taxes Income tax expense increased 2.0 million or 137.2 to 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.7 compared to 20.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, when excluding the impact of the Restructuring (Non-GAAP).

 Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Overview Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.3 million to 4.2 million compared to a net loss of 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The previously disclosed Restructuring, whereby the Company sold certain lower-yielding available-for-sale investment securities with a total par value of 161.2 million and agreed to surrender 21.4 million of BOLI contracts, resulted in a non-recurring, after-tax loss of 14.6 million that was recorded during the third quarter of 2023. Core net income (Non-GAAP), defined as reported net income excluding the non-recurring after-tax loss and taxes paid in conjunction with the Restructuring, was 4.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.30, an increase of 1.02 when compared to the (0.72) reported for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Core diluted earnings per share (Non GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.32. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million or 9.8 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by the increase in yield on interest-earning assets outpacing the increase in costs of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with the decrease in overall funding balances. The Company recorded a 400 thousand provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a recovery of provision for credit losses of 829 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additional discussion of the provision for credit losses is included below under the heading Provision for Credit Losses. Non-interest income was 617 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of 16.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. Core non-interest income (Non-GAAP), defined as reported non-interest income excluding the 17.1 million loss stemming from the bond sale portion of the Restructuring, was 299 thousand for the third quarter 2023. The increase in non-interest income compared to core non-interest income (Non-GAAP) of 318 thousand was primarily attributable to an increase of 199 thousand due to favorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments related to the Company s NQDC and a 133 thousand increase in gains recorded on the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans due to increased sale activity. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in BOLI income of 23 thousand due to the surrender of all BOLI policies in July 2023. Non-interest expense increased 371 thousand or 4.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 322 thousand non-recurring reversal of a litigation reserve during the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the effects of the 322 thousand reversal in 2023, non-interest expense increased 49 thousand or 0.6 during the third quarter of 2024 when compared to adjusted third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in professional fees and data processing expense, partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefit expense. The increase in professional fees was due to increased contract costs and services. The increase in data processing fees was primarily due to contractual increases and volume based activity. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was due to lower incentive accruals and higher direct loan origination costs when compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense as result of mark-to-market fluctuations on the Company s NQDC. The Company continues to analyze cost savings opportunities on existing leases and material contracts. The ROAA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 0.73 and (1.73) , respectively. Core ROAA (Non-GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.76 . The ROAE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 7.00 and (18.24) , respectively. Core ROAE (Non-GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.07

 (1) Core net income reflects net income adjusted for the non-recurring tax effected loss recognized on the sale of available-for-sale securities and non-recurring tax expense associated with the surrender of the Company s BOLI policies in July 2023. Tax benefit (expense) is calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . (2) Core non-interest income reflects non-interest income adjusted for the pre-tax loss recognized on the sale of available-for-sale securities. (3) Includes tax benefit (expense) calculated using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . (4) Core earnings per share diluted is calculated by dividing core net income by basic weighted average shares outstanding and diluted weighted average shares outstanding, respectively, for each period presented. (5) Core return on average assets (annualized) is calculated by dividing annualizing core net income by average assets for each period presented. (6) Core return on average equity (annualized) is calculated by dividing annualizing core net income by average equity for each period presented. 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin The following table presents the average balance for each principal balance sheet category, and the amount of interest income or expense associated with that category, as well as corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 (1) Income and yields for all periods presented are reported on a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 . (2) The Company did not have any loans on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. (3) Tax-equivalent net interest margin adjusts for differences in tax treatment of interest income sources. The entire tax-equivalent adjustment is attributable to interest income on earning assets. Interest expense and the related cost of interest-bearing liabilities and cost of funds ratios are not affected by the tax-equivalent components. Tax-equivalent net interest margin as presented above is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, is a financial measure that the Company believes provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Tax-equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on certain securities and loans, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The following table, Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income, reconciles net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income, which is a non-GAAP measure.

 Net interest income increased 1.2 million or 9.8 on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by the increase in yield on and volume of interest-earning assets outpacing the increase in costs of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with the decrease in overall funding balances. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, the net interest margin was 2.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.08 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in yields on the Company s interest-earning assets and reduction in volume of time deposits. The loan portfolio s yield for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.33 compared to 4.87 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 46 basis points was primarily attributable to an increase in yield on the Company s variable rate loans as a result of an elevated interest rates subsequent to September 30, 2023 coupled with a higher weighted average yield on loans originated since the third quarter of 2023. The yield on interest-bearing deposits due from banks for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.46 compared to 5.43 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 3 basis points was primarily due to a higher average balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period of 2023. The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on tax-equivalent net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to volume.

(2) The Company did not have any loans on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024 or 30, 2023. Interest Income Interest income increased by 2.2 million or 8.1 to 28.5 million on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by both an increase in rates and volume on interest earning assets. The increase in rates on interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to the Company s loan portfolio. The increase in volume of average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to the Company s loan portfolio and interest-bearing deposits due from banks. Fully tax-equivalent interest income on loans increased by approximately 2.4 million as a result of volume and an increase in rates. Average loans increased 27.8 million between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to origination volume in the investor real estate and residential loan portfolios subsequent to September 30, 2023. Fully tax-equivalent interest income on investment securities decreased by approximately 349 thousand primarily as a result of a decrease in volume. Average investment securities decreased approximately 61.1 million between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 primarily due to the sale of certain low-yielding investment securities in July 2023, and to a lesser extent, the amortization of securities. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased by 132 thousand as a result of an increase in volume. Average interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased approximately 9.1 million between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The increase in interest-bearing deposits in other banks was primarily due to a decrease in investments.

 Interest Expense Interest expense increased by 1.0 million to 15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in rates on deposits and increase in volume on borrowings. The increase in rates on deposits was primarily a result of the repricing of the Company s time deposits coupled with an increase in rates offered on deposit accounts subsequent to September 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in benchmark interest rates. The increase in borrowings was primarily a result of the Company s FHLB advances. Provision for Credit Losses The Company recorded a 400 thousand provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 829 thousand recovery of provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the current period that is directly attributable to the funded and unfunded loan portfolios was 48 thousand and 352 thousand, respectively. The provision for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of changes in the Company s loss driver analysis, resulting from a periodic review of our assumptions. The review resulted in a higher modeled probability of default, changes in prepayment and curtailment rates, and an assessment of management s considerations of existing economic versus historical conditions combined with the continued strong credit performance of our loan portfolio segments. See Asset Quality below for additional information on the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Non-interest Income The following table summarizes non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Core non-interest income (Non-GAAP) was 299 thousand for the third quarter 2023. The increase in non-interest income compared to core non-interest income (Non-GAAP) of 318 thousand was primarily attributable to an increase of 199 thousand due to favorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments related to the Company s NQDC and a 133 thousand increase in gains recorded on the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans due to increased sale activity. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in BOLI income of 23 thousand due to the surrender of all BOLI policies in July 2023.

The increase was primarily due to a 322 thousand non-recurring reversal of a litigation reserve during the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the effects of the 322 thousand reversal in 2023, non-interest expense increased 49 thousand or 0.6 during the third quarter of 2024 when compared to adjusted third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in professional fees and data processing expense, partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefit expense. The increase in professional fees was due to increased contract costs and services. The increase in data processing fees was primarily due to contractual increases and volume based activity. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was due to lower incentive accruals and higher direct loan origination costs when compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense as result of mark-to-market fluctuations on the Company s NQDC. The Company continues to analyze cost savings opportunities on existing leases and material contracts. Income Taxes Income tax expense increased 2.6 million to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to tax benefit of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 in connection with the Restructuring. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.7 compared to 17.7 for the same period ended September 30, 2023, when excluding the impact of Restructuring (Non-GAAP).

 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders Equity The Company s total assets increased 31.8 million or 1.4 to 2.27 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.24 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets is primarily attributable to increases in interest-bearing deposits in banks of 78.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in investments of 25.3 million and loans, net of unearned income of 17.4 million. The Company s total liabilities increased 18.6 million or 0.9 to 2.03 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.01 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total liabilities was primarily attributable to a net increase in deposits of 29.5 million partially offset by a reduction of borrowings of 8.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid off its 10.0 million Federal funds purchased, refinanced its 54.0 million advance and advanced an additional 23.0 million from the BTFP in January 2024 to secure lower funding costs relative to wholesale deposits and previously outstanding borrowings. In September, the Company paid off its BTFP. Total borrowings as of September 30, 2024 consisted of subordinated debt totaling 24.7 million and three FHLB advances totaling 56.0 million. The increase in deposits was primarily driven by an increase in interest bearing and non-interest bearing demand deposits of 77.4 million and 61.0 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases in time deposits of 100.6 million. Shareholders equity increased 13.2 million or 5.7 to 243.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 229.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to lower interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increases in equity were partially offset by the 3.6 million in cash dividends paid. Book value per share was 17.07 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 16.25 as of December 31, 2023. Investment Securities The Company maintains a primarily fixed income investment securities portfolio that had a total carrying value of 237.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 265.5 million at December 31, 2023. The investment portfolio is used as a source of liquidity, interest income, and credit risk diversification, as well as to manage rate sensitivity and provide collateral for secured public funds and secured credit lines. Investment securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity based on management s investment strategy and management s assessment of the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. Investment securities that we may sell prior to maturity in response to changes in management s investment strategy, liquidity needs, interest rate risk profile or for other reasons are classified as available-for-sale. The Company also had restricted stock and equity securities within its investment securities portfolio with total carrying values of 7.6 million and 2.7 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and 5.0 million and 2.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The Company did not purchase or sell fixed income investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had 32.1 million in maturities and principal repayments on securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was comprised of 14.3 million of mortgage-backed securities, 14.0 million of U.S. Treasuries, 3.5 million of collateralized mortgage obligation securities and 0.3 of Municipal securities.

The Chief Credit Officer is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of the Company s lending-related transactions. The Company s asset quality remained strong through the first three quarters of 2024. The Company did not have any nonperforming assets, which includes nonperforming loans and OREO, as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As a result, the Company did not have any nonperforming loans, which consists of loans that are 90 days or more past due or loans placed on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company did not have any nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 nor were there any loans placed on nonaccrual during those periods. A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when (i) the Company is advised by the borrower that scheduled principal or interest payments cannot be met, (ii) when management s best judgment indicates that payment in full of principal and 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 interest can no longer be expected, or (iii) when any such loan or obligation becomes delinquent for 90 days, unless it is both well-secured and in the process of collection. As a result, the Company did not have any interest income that would have been recognized on nonaccrual loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following table summarizes the Company s asset quality as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 NM Not meaningful Allowance for Loan Credit Losses Refer to the discussion in Note 1 of the audited financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 contained in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for management s approach to estimating the allowance for loan credit losses. The Company recorded no net charge-offs and a net recovery of 1 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to no net charge-offs or recoveries during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded net recoveries of 2 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for loan credit losses was 18.5 million or 1.00 of outstanding loans, net of unearned income, compared to 19.5 million or 1.05 of outstanding loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans, net of unearned income, was primarily a result of changes in the Company s loss driver analysis, resulting from a periodic review of our assumptions. The review resulted in a higher modeled probability of default, changes in prepayment and curtailment rates, and an assessment of management s considerations of existing economic versus historical conditions combined with the continued strong credit performance of our loan portfolio segments.

There can be no assurance, however, that adjustments to the provision for (recovery of) credit losses will not be required in the future. Changes in the economic assumptions underlying management s estimates and judgments; adverse developments in the economy, on a national basis or in the Company s market area; or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers are criteria that could change and make adjustments to the provision for (recovery of) credit losses necessary. Deposits Total deposits increased 29.5 million or 1.5 to 1.94 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.91 billion as of December 31, 2023. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 61.0 million or 14.8 to 472.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 411.4 million at December 31, 2023. Non-interest bearing demand deposits represented 24.4 and 21.6 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest-bearing deposits, which include NOW accounts, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, and time deposits, decreased 31.5 million or 2.1 to 1.46 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.50 billion as of December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits represented 75.6 and 78.4 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company focuses on funding asset growth with deposit accounts, with an emphasis on core deposit growth, as its primary source of deposits. Core deposits consist of checking accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts, time deposits, reciprocal IntraFi Demand deposits, IntraFi Money Market deposits and IntraFi CD deposits. Core deposits totaled 1.65 billion or 85.5 of total deposits and 1.58 billion or 82.7 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Included in these amounts were 167.8 million and 168.7 million of public fund deposits that are collateralized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Deposits that were not insured or not collateralized represented 37 and 33 of total deposits, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Capital Resources The Company is a bank holding company with less than 3 billion in assets and does not (i) have significant off balance sheet exposure, (ii) engage in significant non-banking activities, or (iii) have a material amount of securities registered under the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company qualifies as a small bank holding company under the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and is currently not subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve, including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, contains additional discussion and analysis regarding the Company and Bank s regulatory capital requirements. Shareholders equity increased 13.2 million or 5.7 to 243.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 229.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to lower interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increases in equity were partially offset by the 3.6 million in cash dividends paid. Book value per share was 17.07 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 16.25 as of December 31, 2023. In July of 2024, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the extension of the Company s stock repurchase program that was originally adopted in August of 2021. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 700,000 shares of its outstanding common stock, or 5.0 of outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024. The stock repurchase program will expire on August 31, 2025, or earlier if all the authorized shares have been repurchased. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its outstanding common stock under the program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company repurchased 3,003 shares of its outstanding common stock under the program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Liquidity Liquidity reflects a financial institution s ability to fund assets and meet current and future financial obligations. Liquidity is essential in all banks to meet customer withdrawals, compensate for balance sheet fluctuations, and provide funds for growth. Monitoring and managing both liquidity measurements is critical in developing prudent and effective balance sheet management. Management conducts liquidity stress testing on a quarterly basis to prepare for unexpected adverse scenarios and contemporaneously develops mitigating strategies to reduce losses in the event of an economic downturn. The Company s principal source of liquidity and funding is its deposit base. The level of deposits necessary to support the Company s lending and investment activities is determined through monitoring loan demand. In addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows, the Company supplements its liquidity with additional sources such as secured borrowing credit lines with the FHLB and the Reserve Bank. Specifically, the Company has pledged a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the FHLB and the Reserve Bank. Based on collateral pledged as of September 30, 2024, the total FHLB available borrowing capacity was 373.2 million. Additional borrowing capacity with the Reserve Bank was approximately 101.6 million as of September 30, 2024. On March 12, 2023, the Reserve Bank made available the BTFP, which enhances the ability of banks to borrow against the par value of certain high-quality, unencumbered investments. The Company refinanced its 54.0 million advance and secured an additional 23.0 million from the BTFP in January 2024. In doing so, the Company obtained lower funding costs relative to wholesale deposits and the prior outstanding BTFP advance. The 77.0 million BTFP advance matures January 2025, bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.76 and can be prepaid in whole or in part, at any time without penalty prior to maturity. On September 3, 2024, the Company paid off the BTFP advance. On September 3, 2024, the Company took out three fixed interest rate advances with terms of 18, 24, and 36 months. The interest rates on the advances range from 3.92 to 4.15 . At September 30, 2024, the Company had three outstanding FHLB advances totaling 56 million. Total liquidity, defined as cash and cash equivalents, unencumbered securities at fair value, and available secured borrowing capacity, was 775.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 638.9 million at December 31, 2023. In addition to available secured borrowing capacity, the Company had available federal funds lines with correspondent banks of 110.0 million at September 30, 2024. Liquidity is a core pillar of the Company s operations. Conditions may arise in the future that could negatively impact the Company s future liquidity position resulting in funding mismatches. These include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash or accessing sources of funds (i.e., market liquidity) and contingent liquidity events. Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal, and reputation risks also can affect a bank s liquidity. Management believes that the Company has a strong liquidity position, but any of the factors referenced above could materially impact that in the future. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees which would impact the Company s liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and or use these commitments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. With the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, that is material to investors. For further information, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, for further discussion of the nature, business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies.
