a price of per share, and only whole warrants are exercisable. The Units were sold at an offering price of per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of on April 28, 2022. 

Substantially concurrently with the closing of
the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of units (the Private Placement Units at a purchase price of 
per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . The Private Placement Unit are identical to the Public
Units in the IPO, except that the holders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Units (except to certain
permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company s initial business combination.

Following the closing of the IPO and the issuance
and the sale of Private Placement Units on April 28, 2022, per Public Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the
Public Units in the IPO and the sale of Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account maintained

with a maturity of days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a 7 under the Investment Company Act
which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to the Company to pay the franchise and income taxes, if any, the effective memorandum and articles of association
at the time and subject to the requirements of law and regulation, will provide that the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private
Placement Units held in the trust account will not be released from the Trust Account (1) to the Company, until the completion of the

to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Company s Class A ordinary shares, and (c) the redemption of the
Company s public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline, subject

of the assets held in
the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and interest income earned on the trust account that is released for working
capital purposes or to pay taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. However, the Company will
only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities
of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no
assurance that the Company will be able to complete an initial business combination successfully. 

The ordinary shares subject to redemption will
be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation
of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted
in favor of the Business Combination. 

Following the closing of the IPO, under the Company s
then-effective amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Company would have until July 28, 2023 (or January 28,
2024 if the Company extends the period of time to consummate an initial business combination) to consummate an initial business combination.
On July 27, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the First EGM ). At the First EGM, the
shareholders of the Company, by special resolution, approved the proposal to amend the Company s then-effective amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (the First Charter Amendment to (i) allow the Company until July 28, 2023 to consummate
an initial business combination, and to (ii) elect to extend the period to consummate an initial business combination up to nine times,
each by an additional one-month period, for a total of up to nine months to April 28, 2024, by depositing to the Company s Trust
Account the amount lesser of (i) for each one-month extension or (ii) for each Public Share for each one-month extension
(the First Charter Amendment Proposal ). Under Cayman Islands law, the First Charter Amendment took effect upon approval
of the First Charter Amendment Proposal by the shareholders at the First EGM. On July 27, 2023, the Company also filed the First Charter
Amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to the First Charter Amendment, the Company may, at the request
of Aimfinity Investment LLC (the Sponsor ), and by approval of the Company s board of directors, elect to extend the
period to consummate an initial business combination up to nine times, each by an additional one-month period (each, a First Charter
Amendment Monthly Extension ), for a total of up to nine months to April 28, 2024, by depositing to the Trust Account for
each First Charter Amendment Monthly Extension. 

On April 23, 2024, the Company held a second extraordinary
general meeting of shareholders (the Second EGM ). At the Second EGM, the shareholders of the Company, by special resolution,
approved the proposal to amend the Company s then-effective amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Second
Charter Amendment to (i) allow the Company until April 28, 2024 to consummate an initial business combination, and to (ii) elect
to extend the period to consummate an initial business combination up to nine times, each by an additional one-month period (each a Second
Charter Amendment Monthly Extension ), for a total of up to nine months to January 28, 2025 (the Combination Deadline ),
by depositing to the Company s Trust Account the amount lesser of (i) for each one-month extension or (ii) for each
Public Share for each one-month extension (the Second Charter Amendment Monthly Extension ). On April 27, 2024, the Company
filed the Second Charter Amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. 

On May 23, 2024, in connection with the votes
to approve the Second Charter Amendment, the holders of of Public Shares of the Company exercised their right to redeem their
shares for cash at redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately . 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
a total of was deposited into the Trust Account for the Public Shareholders, resulting in extensions of the period of time the
Company has to consummate the initial business combination by October 28, 2024. 

If the Company does not consummate an initial
business combination by the Combination Deadline, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)
as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust
Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the franchise and income taxes that were paid by the Company or are payable
by the Company, if any (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public
Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval
of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case
to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law.

per share (the Class B ordinary shares , together with Class A ordinary
shares, the ordinary shares of the Company are identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the units being sold
in the IPO, and holders of Founder Shares have the same shareholder rights as Public Shareholders, except that: (a) the founder shares
will automatically convert into the Company s Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial business combination, (b) the Founder
Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below; (c) prior to the initial business combination,
only holders of the Founder Shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors and holders of a majority of the Company s
Founder Shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason; (d) in a vote to continue the Company in a jurisdiction outside
the Cayman Islands (which requires the approval of at least two thirds of the votes of all ordinary shares voted at a general meeting),
holders of the Company s Founder Shares have ten votes for every Founder Share and, as a result, the Company s initial shareholders
will be able to approve any such proposal without the vote of any other shareholder; (e) the Company s Sponsor and each member of
the management team have entered into an agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption
rights with respect to their Founder Shares, (ii) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares
in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s Charter (A) that would modify the substance or timing
of the obligation to provide the Public Shareholders the right to have their Public Shares redeemed in connection with the initial business
combination or to redeem of the Company s Public Shares if the Company does not complete the initial business combination by
the Combination Deadline, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Company s Class A
ordinary shares; and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares they
hold if the Company fail to consummate an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline, although they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame; and (f) the Founder Shares are entitled to registration rights. If the Company
seek shareholder approval of the Company s initial business combination, the Company will complete the initial business combination
only if the Company obtains the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company. In such case, the Company s Sponsor and each
member of the management team have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and Public Shares in favor of the initial business combination. 

The Founder Shares will automatically convert
into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial business combination at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares
issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, approximately of the sum of
(i) the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon completion of the IPO, plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary
shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued,
by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary
shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued, or to be issued,
to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement units issued to the Company s Sponsor, its affiliates
or any member of the management team upon conversion of working capital loans. In no event will the Class B ordinary shares convert into
Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one-to-one. 

The Sponsor, Aimifnity Investment LLC, has agreed
that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Company s registered public
accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed
entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and
(ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than
 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to
pay the Company s tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target
business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the indemnity
of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that
an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. 

The Merger Agreement 

On October 13, 2023, the Company entered into
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Merger
Agreement with Docter Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Docter ), Aimfinity Investment Merger Sub I, a Cayman Islands
exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Purchaser ), and Aimfinity Investment Merger Sub II, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser Merger Sub ), pursuant to which (a) Company will be merged
with and into Purchaser (the Reincorporation Merger ), with Purchaser surviving the Reincorporation Merger, and (b) Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Docter (the Acquisition Merger ), with Docter surviving the Acquisition Merger as a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the Business Combination ). Following consummation of the Business
Combination (the Closing ), Purchaser will be a publicly traded company (Purchaser is sometimes referred to herein as PubCo ,
upon and following the consummation of the Reincorporation Merger).

and a working
deficit of . The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly
traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of an initial business combination. 

The Company s cash and working capital as
of September 30, 2024, are not sufficient to complete its planned activities to consummate an initial business combination for the upcoming
year. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard
Board s FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete an initial business
combination by the Combination Deadline, the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and
thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate an initial business combination
will be successful by the Combination Deadline. As a result, management has determined that such additional conditions also raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Public Units at per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of . Each Public Unit consists of one Public
Share and one Class 1 warrant and one-half of one Class 2 warrant. The Company will not issue fractional shares. As a result, the warrants
must be exercised in multiples of one whole warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of the Company s
Public Share at a price of per share, and only whole warrants are exercisable. The warrants will become exercisable on the later
of 30 days after the completion of the initial business combination or 12 months from the closing of the IPO, and will (except for Class
2 Warrants embedded in the Public Shares that are redeemed prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, which Class
2 warrant will be forfeited and cancelled upon redemption of such shares) expire after the completion of the initial business
combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. As a result, if the Public Shareholders redeem their Public Shares prior to the
consummation of the initial business combination, the embedded Class 2 warrant will be forfeited and cancelled. 

The Class 1 and Class 2 warrants have similar
terms, except that following June 14, 2022, the 52nd day following the effective date of the IPO, the holders of the Public Units have
the option to separate the Public Units into one Class 1 warrant and one new units of the Company (the New Units , with each
consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one Class 2 warrant), and to have the Class 1 warrants and new Units separately
traded on the Nasdaq Global Market. The holders of the New Units resulting from such separation will not have the option to separate such
New Units into its components, the Class A ordinary shares and the Class 2 warrants, for separate trading until consummation of the initial
business combination. 

All of the Public Shares sold as part
of the Public Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares if there is a stockholder
vote or tender offer in connection with an initial business combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s
effective amended and restated certificate of incorporation at the time, or in connection with the Company s liquidation. In accordance
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which
has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject
to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. 

The Company s redeemable Class A ordinary
shares is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If
it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption
value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable,
if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur
and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected
to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings,
or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of , or approximately per share. On March 18, 2022, the Sponsor surrendered
to the Company for cancellation founder shares for no consideration, resulting in the Company s initial shareholders holding
an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares, or approximately per share. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
there were founder shares issued and outstanding. 

On March 29, 2022, the Sponsor transferred 
founder shares to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company and founder shares to certain members of the board of directors. If
the officer and director nominee do not become an officer or director of the Company at the time of the Company s initial public
offering, is removed from office as director, or voluntarily resigns his position with the Company before a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination involving the Company the Triggering Event ),
all of such shares shall be returned to Sponsor. Further, considering that in case an initial business combination does not occur these
awards will be forfeited, it was deemed that the above terms result in the vesting provision whereby the share awards would vest only
upon the consummation of an initial business combination or change of control event. As a result, any compensation expense in relation
to these grants will be recognized at the Triggering Event. As a result, the Company recorded no compensation expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The fair value of the founder shares on the grant
date was approximately per share. The valuation performed by the Company determined the fair value of the shares on the date of
grant by applying a discount based upon a) the probability of a successful IPO, b) the probability of a successful Business Combination,
and c) the lack of marketability of the Founder Shares. The aggregate grant date fair value of the awards amounted to approximately . 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined
that an initial business combination is not considered probable, and therefore, no stock-based compensation expense has been recognized.
Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested founder shares as of September 30, 2024 amounted to approximately 
and is expected to be recognized upon the Triggering Event. 

The founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary
shares and will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial Business Combination at a ratio such that
the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted
basis, approximately of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon completion of the IPO, plus
(ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked
securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business
Combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares
issued, deemed issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any private placement units issued to the
Company s sponsor, its affiliates or any member of the management team upon conversion of working capital loans. In no event will
the Class B ordinary shares convert into Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one-to-one.

upon redemption or liquidation. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
 Class 1 Warrants and Class 2 Warrants are outstanding (including Class 1 Warrants and Class 2 Warrants

The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than 20 business days, after the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become
effective within 60 business days after the closing of the initial Business Combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in
the warrant agreement; provided that if the Company s Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed
on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of
the Securities Act, the Company may, at the Company s option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to
do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects,
the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and the Company will use its commercially reasonably
efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. If a registration
statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after
the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement
and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, and the Company will use its commercially
reasonably efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In such
event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the
 fair market value (defined below) less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The fair
market value as used in this paragraph means the volume weighted average price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading
days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated on July 26, 2021 (inception) as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange,
asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the Initial
Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the
sale of our shares, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of
our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an Initial Business Combination will be successful. 

Our Initial Public Offering 

On April 28, 2022, we consummated
our IPO of 8,050,000 units, which included 1,050,000 units issued pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment
option (the Public Units ), each Public Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share (the Class A Ordinary Shares of the Company, par value 0.0001 per share (the Public Shares ), one Class 1 redeemable warrant (the Class 1 Warrants and one-half of one Class 2 redeemable warrant (the Class 2 Warrants , together with Class 1 Warrants, the Warrants of the Company (each, a Public Warrant ), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A
ordinary share for 11.50 per share. The Public Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of
 80,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (the Private Placement with
Aimfinity Investment LLC, our sponsor (the Sponsor ), of an aggregate of 492,000 units (the Private Placement Units (including 42,000 Private Placement Units purchased pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option)
at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 4,920,000. Each Private Placement Unit consists
of one Class A ordinary share (the Private Placement Shares ), one Class 1 Warrant, and one-half of one Class 2 Warrant.
The terms and provisions of the warrants in the Private Placement Units (together, the Private Placement Warrants are identical
to the Public Warrants, except that, subject to certain limited exceptions, they are subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following
the consummation of the Company s initial business combination. On April 28, 2022, a total of 82,110,000 of the net proceeds from
the IPO and the Private Placement was deposited in a trust account (the Trust Account established for the benefit of the
Company s Public Shareholders at a U.S. based trust account, with U.S. Bank, National Association, acting as trustee. 

20 

The Class 1 Warrants and
Class 2 Warrants have similar terms, except that the Class 1 Warrants separated and began separate trading on June 16, 2022 (the 52nd
day following the effective date of the IPO). Holders have the option to continue to hold the Public Units or separate the Class 1 Warrants
from the Public Units. Separation of the Class 1 Warrants from the Public Units will result in new units consisting of one Class A ordinary
share and one-half of one Class 2 Warrant (the New Units ). Holders will need to have their brokers contact the Company s
transfer agent in order to separate the Public Units into Class 1 Warrants and New Units consisting of one Class A ordinary share and
one-half of one Class 2 Warrant. Additionally, the Public Units and the New Units will automatically separate into their component parts
and will not be traded after completion of the initial business combination. 

Since our IPO, our sole business
activity has been identifying, evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates and preparing for consummation of an initial business
combination. We presently have no revenue and have had losses since inception from incurring formation and operating costs. We have relied
upon the sale of our securities and loans from the Sponsor and other parties to fund our operations.

security of PubCo except as provided in the Business Combination Agreement or under operation of law. 

At the effective time of
the Acquisition Merger (the Effective Time ), which shall take place one business after the Reincorporation Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the Acquisition Merger and without any action on the part of us, PubCo, Merger Sub, the Target or the stockholders
of the Target immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the Pre-Closing Target Stockholders ), each Target stockholder s
shares of common stock of the Target Target Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except

of the Closing Payment Shares (as defined below) as set forth in the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet (as defined in the Business Combination

Amendment No. 1 to the Business Combination Agreement 

On April 5, 2024, we, Purchaser,
Merger Sub and Target entered into an amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the Amendment No. 1 to modify the
composition of PubCo s board of directors upon and immediately following the completion of the Business Combination. 

Before Amendment No. 1 was
adopted, the Business Combination Agreement provides that, upon and immediately following the closing of the Business Combination, PubCo s
board of directors shall consist of five (5) directors, among which four (4) directors will be designated by the Sponsor, until the second
general meeting of shareholders of PubCo, and one (1) director will be designated by the Target until the first general meeting of shareholders
of PubCo. 

Pursuant to the Amendment
No. 1, upon and immediately following the closing of the Business Combination, PubCo s board of directors shall consist of five
(5) directors, among which three (3) directors will be designated by the Target until the first general meeting of shareholders of PubCo,
and two (2) directors will be designated by the Sponsor until the second general meeting of shareholders of PubCo. 

Extensions 

Following the closing of
the IPO, under the Company s then-effective amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Company would have
until July 28, 2023 (or January 28, 2024 if the Company extends the period of time to consummate an initial business combination) to consummate
an initial business combination. On July 27, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the First
EGM ). At the First EGM, the shareholders of the Company, by special resolution, approved the proposal to amend the Company s
then effective amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the First Charter Amendment to (i) allow the
Company until July 28, 2023 to consummate an initial business combination, and to (ii) elect to extend the period to consummate an initial
business combination up to nine times, each by an additional one-month period, for a total of up to nine months to April 28, 2024, by
depositing to the Company s Trust Account the amount lesser of (i) 85,000 for each one-month extension or (ii) 0.04 for each Public
Share for each one-month extension (the First Charter Amendment Proposal ). Under Cayman Islands law, the First Charter Amendment
took effect upon approval of the First Charter Amendment Proposal by the shareholders at the First EGM. Pursuant to the First Charter
Amendment, a total of 9 one-month extensions, each in the amount of 85,000 (each, a First Charter Amendment Monthly Extension ),
were sought by the Company, with a total of 765,000 deposited by the Sponsor or its designee to the Trust Account, extending the Combination
Deadline from July 28, 2023 to April 28, 2024. 

On April 23, 2024, the Company
held a second extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Second EGM ). At the Second EGM, the shareholders of the
Company, by special resolution, approved the proposal to amend the Company s then-effective amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association (the Second Charter Amendment to (i) allow the Company until April 28, 2024 to consummate an initial
business combination, and to (ii) elect to extend the period to consummate an initial business combination up to nine times, each by an
additional one-month period (each a Second Charter Amendment Monthly Extension ), for a total of up to nine months to January
28, 2025 (the Combination Deadline ), by depositing to the Company s Trust Account the amount lesser of (i) 60,000
for each one-month extension or (ii) 0.035 for each Public Share for each one-month extension (the Second Charter Amendment Monthly
Extension ). On April 27, 2024, the Company filed the Second Charter Amendment with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. 

As of the date hereof, the
Company made 6 payments for three Second Charter Amendment Monthly Extensions into Trust Account for the Public Shareholders each time
in an aggregate of 60,000, resulting in an extension of the Combination Deadline by November 28, 2024. 

For each payment in connection
with the First Charter Amendment Monthly Extension or the Second Charter Amendment Monthly Extension, on the date such payment was deposited
to the Company s Trust Account, we issued an unsecured promissory note to I-Fa Chang to evidence the payments made by him for the
deposit of such payment (in the amount of 85,000 or 60,000), as the case may be (in each case, a Monthly Extension Note ). 

Each of such Monthly Extension
Notes have the same terms, except with regard to the amount. Each note bears no interest and is payable in full upon the earlier to occur
of (i) the consummation of the Company s Initial Business Combination or (ii) the date of expiry of the term of the Company (the
 Maturity Date ). The following shall constitute an event of default: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business
days of the Maturity Date; (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action, (iii) the breach of the Company s
obligations thereunder; (iv) any cross defaults; (v) an enforcement proceedings against the Company; and (vi) any unlawfulness and invalidity
in connection with the performance of the obligations thereunder, in which case such Monthly Extension Note may be accelerated. 

The payee of each Monthly
Extension Note, I-Fa Chang, has the right, but not the obligation, to convert each Monthly Extension Note, in whole or in part, respectively,
into Private Placement Units of the Company, that are identical to the Private Placement Units issued by the Company in the Private Placement
consummated simultaneously with the Company s IPO, subject to certain exceptions, as described in the Prospectus, by providing the
Company with written notice of the intention to convert at least two business days prior to the closing of the Initial Business Combination.
The number of Private Placement Units to be received by I-Fa Chang in connection with such conversion shall be an amount determined by
dividing (x) the sum of the outstanding principal amount payable to the Sponsor by (y) 10.00. 

The issuance of the Monthly
Extension Notes were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

22 

Amendment No. 1 

On April 5, 2024, we, Purchaser,
Merger Sub and Docter Inc. entered into an amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the Amendment No. 1 to modify
the composition of PubCo s board of directors upon and immediately following the completion of the Business Combination. 

Pursuant to the Amendment
No. 1, upon and immediately following the closing of the Business Combination, PubCo s board of directors shall consist of five
(5) directors, among which three (3) directors will be designated by Docter until the first general meeting of shareholders of PubCo,
and two (2) directors will be designated by the Sponsor until the second general meeting of shareholders of PubCo. 

Backstop Agreement 

On October 16, 2024, the
Company, Purchaser, and Family Inheritance Consulting (H.K.) Limited Backstop Investor ), entered into a certain backstop
agreement, under which the Backstop Investor agrees to purchase, and the Investor agrees to purchase, at the request of the Company, Class
A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, of the Company, at a price of 10.00 per share in the aggregated purchase price (the Purchase
Price no less than the minimum amount of cash (the Commitment resulting in the net tangible assets of the Purchaser
upon the closing of the Business Combination being no less than 5,000,001 in accordance with the requests of the redemption that it has
received in connection with the Business Combination immediately prior to the cut-off time to accept redemption request as set forth in
its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Redemption Requests ), if and only if the Company reasonably
believes that redemptions by public shareholders of the Company in connection with the Business Combination will result in the net tangible
assets of the Purchaser upon the closing of the Business Combination being less than 5,000,001 based on the Redemption Requests. In connection
with such purchase, the Investor waives redemption rights associated with the purchased shares, and shall receive the same numbers of
ordinary shares of the Purchaser, par value 0.0001 per share, upon the closing of the Business Combination. 

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in
any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from July 26, 2021 (inception) to September 30, 2024 were organizational
activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO, described below, and, after the IPO, identifying a target company for an Initial Business
Combination and to complete the Business Combination with Docter, Inc. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of our Initial Business Combination. We may generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing an Initial Business Combination. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 24,789 which consisted of interest income of 464,528 on investments held in Trust Account
which was offset by operating cost of 439,739. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 540,850 which consisted of interest income of 938,777 on investments held in Trust Account
which was offset by operating cost of 397,927. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 902,163 which consisted of interest income of 1,603,118 on investments held in Trust Account
which was offset by operating cost of 700,955. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,860,776 which consisted of interest income of 2,705,381 on investments held in Trust Account
which was offset by operating cost of 844,605. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Until the consummation of the IPO, our only source
of liquidity was an initial purchase of ordinary shares by the Sponsor and loans from our Sponsor. 

23 

Following the closing of
the IPO and sale of the Private Placement Units on April 28, 2022, a total of 82,110,000 was placed in the Trust Account, and we had
 1,495,650 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the IPO, and available for working capital purposes.
In connection with the IPO, we incurred 5,117,607 in transaction costs, consisting of 1,610,000 of underwriting fees, 2,817,500 of
deferred underwriting fees and 690,107 of other offering costs. 

As of September 30, 2024,
 36,327,836 was held in the Trust Account in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury Securities. We intend to use substantially
all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding deferred
underwriting commissions, to complete our Initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes,
if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an Initial Business Combination,
the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses,
make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

Aimfinity intends to use
the funds held outside the Trust Account to primarily identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective
target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives
or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete an initial
business combination. 

In order to fund working
capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the
Sponsor or certain of Aimfinity s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. 

On December 8, 2023, the
Company issued a promissory note to I-Fa Chang, as the designee, sole member and manager of the Sponsor, under which I-Fa Chang agreed
to loan the Company up to 500,000 to be used for a portion of the working capital. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is
due at the earlier of (1) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination or (2) the date on which the Company
liquidates and dissolves. I-Fa Chang, as the payee, has the right, but not the obligation, to convert the note, in whole or in part, into
Private Placement Units of the Company, that are identical to the Private Placement Units issued by the Company in the Private Placement
consummated simultaneously with the Company s IPO, subject to certain exceptions, as described in the IPO Prospectus, by providing
the Company with written notice of the intention to convert at least two business days prior to the closing of the Initial Business Combination.
The number of Private Placement Units to be received by I-Fa Chang in connection with such conversion shall be an amount determined by
dividing (x) the sum of the outstanding principal amount payable to I-Fa Chang by (y) 10.00. 

On April 4, 2024, the Company
issued a promissory note to I-Fa Chang, as the designee, sole member and manager of the Sponsor, under which I-Fa Chang agreed to loan
the Company up to 500,000 to be used for a portion of the working capital. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at
the earlier of (1) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination or (2) the date on which the Company liquidates
and dissolves. I-Fa Chang, as the payee, has the right, but not the obligation, to convert the note, in whole or in part, into Private
Placement Units of the Company, that are identical to the Private Placement Units issued by the Company in the Private Placement consummated
simultaneously with the Company s IPO, subject to certain exceptions, as described in the IPO Prospectus, by providing the Company
with written notice of the intention to convert at least two business days prior to the closing of the Initial Business Combination. The
number of Private Placement Units to be received by I-Fa Chang in connection with such conversion shall be an amount determined by dividing
(x) the sum of the outstanding principal amount payable to I-Fa Chang by (y) 10.00. 

On October 21, 2024, the
Company issued a promissory note to I-Fa Chang, as the designee, sole member and manager of the Sponsor, under which I-Fa Chang agreed
to loan the Company up to 1,500,000 to be used for a portion of the working capital. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and
is due at the earlier of (1) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination or (2) the date on which the Company
liquidates and dissolves. I-Fa Chang, as the payee, has the right, but not the obligation, to convert the note, in whole or in part, into
Private Placement Units of the Company, that are identical to the Private Placement Units issued by the Company in the Private Placement
consummated simultaneously with the Company s IPO, subject to certain exceptions, as described in the IPO Prospectus, by providing
the Company with written notice of the intention to convert at least two business days prior to the closing of the Initial Business Combination.
The number of Private Placement Units to be received by I-Fa Chang in connection with such conversion shall be an amount determined by
dividing (x) the sum of the outstanding principal amount payable to I-Fa Chang by (y) 10.00. 

24 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company, had 1,012,159
borrowings under the working capital loans. 

As of September 30, 2024 the Company had cash
of 4,895 and a working capital deficiency of 2,972,900. 

In connection with the Company s
assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, 
management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
In addition, if the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination by the Combination Deadline, the Company s board
of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance
that the Company s plans to consummate an initial business combination will be successful by the Combination Deadline. As a result,
management has determined that such additional conditions also raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in
transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any
off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities,
or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

Registration Rights 

The holders of the founder
shares, Private Placement Units and Private Warrants, including any of those issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any
Private Placement Units issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans)
will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement signed on April 25, 2022. The holders
of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities.
In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed after
the completion of our Initial Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements. 

Underwriting Agreement 

We granted the underwriters
a 45-day option from the date of the IPO to purchase up to 1,050,000 additional Public Units to cover over- allotments, if any, at the
IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full on April 27, 2022. 

The underwriters received
a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Public Unit, or 1,610,000 in the aggregate and paid at the closing of the IPO. In addition,
the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Public Unit, or approximately 2,817,500 in the aggregate upon the consummation
of an initial business combination. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account
solely in the event that the Company completes its initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements
are presented in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s
financial statements.

of 85,000 or 60,000), as the case may be (in each case, a Monthly Extension Note ). 

Each of such Monthly Extension
Notes have the same terms, except with regard to the amount. Each note bears no interest and is payable in full upon the earlier to occur
of (i) the consummation of the Company s Initial Business Combination or (ii) the date of expiry of the term of the Company (the
 Maturity Date ). The following shall constitute an event of default: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business
days of the Maturity Date; (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action, (iii) the breach of the Company s
