million, of which million was received at closin g. The remaining million was received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The s ale of the Servus brand included the sale of inventory, fixed assets, customer relationships and tradenames, all of which related to our Wholesale segment. We recorded a gain on the sale of Servus of approximately million which is recorded within Interest Expense and Other - net on the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 

Trade receivables represent our right to unconditional payment. 
 
 Current contract receivables represent contractual minimum payments required under non-cancellable contracts with the U.S. Military and other customers with a duration of one year or less. 
 
 Current contract liabilities are performance obligations that we expect to satisfy or relieve within the next twelve months, advance consideration obtained prior to satisfying a performance obligation, or unconditional obligations to provide goods or services under non-cancellable contracts before the transfer of goods or services to the customer has occurred. Our contract liability represents unconditional obligations to provide goods under non-cancellable contracts with the U.S. Military and other customers. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there are no contract receivable or contract liability balances outstanding. 
 
 Items considered immaterial within the context of the contract are recognized as an expense. 
 
 Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue producing transaction that are collected from customers are excluded from revenue. 
 
 Costs associated with our manufacturer s warranty are recognized as expense when the products are sold. 
 
 Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in operating expenses. 
 
 Contract Balances 
 
 The following table provides information about contract liabilities from contracts with our customers:

Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 All revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of our products pass to the customer at point of shipment or point of sale for retail customers. Because all revenues are recognized at a point in time and are disaggregated by channel, our segment disclosures are consistent with disaggregation requirements. See Note 14 - Segment Information for segment disclosures. 

million, million and million at September 30, 2024 , December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. We calculate the allowance based on historical experience, the age of the receivables, receivable insurance status, and identification of customer accounts that are likely to prove difficult to collect due to various criteria including pending bankruptcy. However, estimates of the allowance in any future period are inherently uncertain and actual allowances may differ from these estimates. If actual or expected future allowances were significantly greater or less than established reserves, a reduction or increase to bad debt expense would be recorded in the period this determination was made. Our credit policy generally provides that trade receivables will be deemed uncollectible and written-off once we have pursued all reasonable efforts to collect on the account.

million asset-based lending credit facility (the "ABL Facility") and a million term loan facility (the "Term Facility"). The ABL Agreement is collateralized by a first -lien on substantially all of the Company's domestic assets. The ABL Facility includes a separate first in, last out (FILO) tranche, which allows the Company to borrow at higher advance rates on eligible accounts receivables and inventory balances. As of September 30, 2024 , we had borrowing capacity of million under the ABL Facility. The Term Facility provides for monthly principal payments until the date of maturity, at which date the remaining principal balance is due. 

This transaction resulted in a million expense within Interest Expense and Other - net in the accompanying Unaudited Combined Condensed Statements of Operations, consisting of a million loss on term loan extinguishment and a million term loan prepayment penalty for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The million loss on term loan extinguishment is included as a noncash adjustment to net income and the million prepayment penalty is included within Repayments of long-term debt in the accompanying Unaudited Combined Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Loans under the ABL agreement bear interest at a variable rate equal to either (i) the Base Rate (as calculated in the ABL Agreement) or (ii) Term SOFR (as calculated in the ABL Agreement), plus in each case an interest margin determined by the Company's average daily availability as a percentage of the aggregate amount of revolving commitments for revolving loans and term loans, with a range of Base Rate margins and term SOFR margins, as set forth of the following chart:

 In connection with the ABL Agreement, we paid certain fees that were capitalized and will be amortized over the life of such agreement. 
 
 Current and long-term debt under the ABL Agreement consisted of the following:

Credit Facility Covenants 
 
 Our ABL Facility and Term Facility require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with all credit facility covenants. The ABL Facility and Term Facility also contain restrictions on the amount of dividend payments. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with the amounts paid on dividends in accordance with our debt facilities. 
 
 Retired Term Debt 
 
 On March 15, 2021, we entered into a senior secured term loan facility with TCW Asset Management Company, LLC ("TCW"), as agent, for the lenders party thereto in the amount of million (the "TCW Term Facility"). The TCW Term Facility provided for quarterly payments of principal and bore interest of LIBOR plus through June 30, 2021. After that date, interest was assessed quarterly based on our total leverage ratio. The total leverage ratio was calculated as (a) Total Debt to (b) EBITDA. If our total leverage ratio was greater than or equal to 4.00, the effective interest rate would have been SOFR plus (or at our option, Prime Rate plus ). If our total leverage ratio was less than 4.00 but greater than or equal to 3.50, the effective interest rate would have been SOFR plus (or at our option, Prime Rate plus ). If our total leverage ratio was less than 3.50 but greater than 3.00, the effective interest rate would have been SOFR plus (or at our option, Prime Rate plus ). If our total leverage ratio was less than 3.00, the effective interest rate would have been SOFR plus (or at our option, Prime Rate plus ). The TCW Term Facility also had a SOFR floor rate of . In June 2022, we entered into a second amendment with TCW to further amend the TCW Term Facility to consent to the modifications in our borrowing capacity under the Original ABL Facility as described below, and to adjust certain pricing and prepayment terms, among other things. The second amendment also modified the interest index to provide the use of SOFR to calculate interest rather than LIBOR. The effective interest rate was increased to SOFR plus through November 2022. In November 2022, the TCW Term Facility was amended to increase the effective interest rate to SOFR plus until June 2023 and to provide certain EBITDA adjustments with respect to financial covenants, among other things. In May 2023, we entered into a fourth amendment to the TCW Term Facility to provide certain EBITDA adjustments in respect of the financial covenants, adjust the method to calculate total debt, continue certain pricing terms, extend certain prepayment terms, and pay such lenders certain amendment fees, among other things. In October 2023, we entered into a sixth amendment to the TCW Term Facility to provide certain EBITDA adjustments in respect of the financial covenants, adjust the performance pricing grid, adjust the total leverage ratio periodically through June 30, 2025, among other things. 

The TCW Term Facility was collateralized by a second -lien on accounts receivable, inventory, cash and related assets and a first -lien on substantially all other assets. The TCW Term Facility was replaced by the Term Facility that was part of the ABL Agreement in April 2024. 
 
 On March 15, 2021, we also entered into a senior secured asset-based credit facility (the "Original ABL Facility") with Bank of America, N.A. as agent, for the lenders party thereto. The Original ABL Facility provided a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility up to a principal amount of million, which included a sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit up to million. The Original ABL Facility would be increased up to an additional million at the borrowers request and the lenders option, subject to customary conditions. In June 2022, we further amended the Original ABL Facility to temporarily increase our borrowing capacity to million through December 31, 2022, which thereafter was reduced to million. In November 2022, we entered into a third amendment to the Original ABL Facility to provide certain EBITDA adjustments with respect to our financial covenant. The Original ABL Facility included a separate first in, last out (FILO) tranche, which allowed us to borrow at higher advance rates on eligible accounts receivables and inventory balances. In October 2023, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Original ABL Facility to provide certain EBITDA adjustments with respect to our financial covenant. 
 
 The Original ABL Facility was collateralized by a first -lien on accounts receivable, inventory, cash and related assets and a second -lien on substantially all other assets. The Original ABL Facility was replaced with the ABL Facility that was part of the ABL Agreement in April 2024. Interest on the Original ABL Facility was based on the amount available to be borrowed as set forth on the following chart:

 >33.3 and

In connection with the TCW Term Facility and the Original ABL Facility, we had to pay certain fees that were capitalized and amortized over the life of each respective loan. In addition, the Original ABL Facility required us to pay an annual collateral management fee in the amount of due on each anniversary of the issuance date, until it matured. 
 
 Current and long-term debt under the Original ABL Facility and TCW Term Facility consisted of the following: 

Original ABL Facility amended and restated in April 2024: 

SOFR borrowings with an effective interest rate of 7.31 and 7.25 as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively

Retired Credit Facility Covenants 
 
 The TCW Term Facility contained restrictive covenants which required us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the TCW Term Facility agreement. The Original ABL Facility contained a restrictive covenant which required us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio upon a triggering event taking place (as defined in the Original ABL Facility). During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all credit facility covenants. 
 
 The TCW Term Facility and the Original ABL Facility also contained restrictions on the amount of dividend payments. 
 
 We were in compliance with all TCW Term Facility and Original ABL Facility Agreement covenants through April 26, 2024, the date on which we refinanced such debt. 

and , r espectively. The effective tax rate used for interim reporting purposes is based on management s best estimate of factors impacting the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and includes the impact of discrete items recognized in the quarter. There can be no assurance that the effective tax rate estimated for interim financial reporting purposes will approximate the effective tax rate determined at fiscal year-end. 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. for federal, state, and local purposes, and in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company's tax years 2019 through 2023 remain open to examination by most taxing authorities. 
 
 Our policy is to accrue interest and penalties on any uncertain tax position as a component of income tax expense. such expenses were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . We do not believe there will be any material changes in our uncertain tax positions over the next 12 months.

These distribution channels vary by product line and target market and include sporting goods stores, outdoor retailers, independent shoe retailers, hardware stores, catalogs, mass merchants, uniform stores, farm store chains, specialty safety stores, specialty retailers and online retailers. 
 
 Retail. In our Retail segment, we market directly to consumers through our Lehigh business-to-business including direct sales and through our CustomFit websites, consumer e-commerce websites, third -party marketplaces and our Rocky Outdoor Gear Store. Through our outdoor gear store, we generally sell first quality or discontinued products in addition to a limited amount of factory damaged goods, which typically carry lower gross margins.

 For segment reporting purposes, management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources.

We are accounting for these post summary corrections as a gain contingency, and as such have not recorded these potential refunds within the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet due to uncertainty of collection. Refunds received will be recognized as a reduction to the cost of goods sold when, and if, the refunds are received. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we amended and restated our Original ABL Facility which resulted in a restated 175.0 million revolving credit facility and a new 50.0 million term facility. The proceeds from this transaction were used to retire our existing senior secured term loan facility with TCW Asset Management Company, LLC as of April 26, 2024. This transaction resulted in an expense of 2.6 million, consisting of a loss on extinguishment of term debt in the amount of 1.1 million and a 1.5 million prepayment penalty, which are included in Interest Expense and Other - net within the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 10 - Long Term Debt to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our long-term debt. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we divested the Servus brand. The gain of approximately 1.3 million on the sale of the Servus brand was recorded within Interest Expense and Other - net in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Following the sale of the Servus brand, we manufactured Servus product on behalf of the buyer, pursuant to a transition services agreement. These sales were recorded within our Contract Manufacturing reporting segment and are not expected to recur on an ongoing basis. The Servus brand was sold to allow us to focus on our more profitable core brands and allocate resources toward growth and development of additional opportunities with those brands moving forward. 
 
 In 2023, we were also awarded a new multi-year contract with the U.S. Military pursuant to which we will produce and ship a minimum number of pairs to the U.S. Military through 2026, with the option to extend. The sales under this contract are included in our Contract Manufacturing reporting segment. The first quarter of 2024 was the first full quarter in which shipments were made to the U.S. Military under this multi-year contract.

Net sales decreased 8.8 to 114.6 million; 

Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 38.1 ; 

Inventory decreased 11.8 to 171.8 million as of September 30, 2024 ; and

Net sales decreased 3.0 to 325.7 million; 

Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 38.6 for the; and 

Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 80 basis points to 22.6 million. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods last year, our Wholesale segment sales decreased, due to certain nonrecurring sales, while our Retail segment sales increased, due to an increase in sales under our Lehigh CustomFit platform. Additionally, our Contract Manufacturing segment sales increased despite a decrease in private label contract sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the U.S. Military contract awarded in the fourth quarter of 2023. These factors combined with an increase in Wholesale gross margin resulted in an overall increase in gross margin for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year perio ds.

Net sales decreased 8.8 to 114.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 125.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decline in net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year period was attributable to a decrease in Wholesale net sales, partially offset by an increase in Retail and Contract Manufacturing net sales. 
 
 Gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 43.6 million, or 38.1 of net sales, compared to 46.5 million, or 37.0 of net sales, for the same period last year. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was due to Wholesale product mix as well as a higher percentage of Retail net sales, which carry higher gross margins than our Wholesale and Contract Manufacturing segments. 
 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 33.6 million, or 29.3 of net sales, compared to 32.3 million, or 25.7 of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to incremental brand building and advertising programs to support future growth. 

Income from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was 10.1 million, or 8.8 of net sales, compared to 14.3 million, or 11.3 of net sales, for the same period a year ago. The decrease in income from operations was primarily driven by a decrease in net sales and increase in operating expenses offset by an increase in gross margin in the current year period. 

Net sales decreased 3.0 to 325.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 335.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in net sales in the current year over the prior year period was attributable to a decrease in Wholesale net sales, partially offset by an increase in Retail and Contract Manufacturing net sales. 

Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 125.8 million or 38.6 of net sales compared to 127.9 million or 38.1 of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was due to Wholesale product mix as well as a higher percentage of Retail net sales, which carry higher gross margins than our Wholesale and Contract Manufacturing segments. 

Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 103.3 million, or 31.7 of net sales, compared to 107.2 million, or 31.9 of net sales, for the prior year period. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to restructuring and cost-savings achieved from initiatives implemented during the first half of 2023. 

Income from operations for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.6 million, or 6.9 of net sales, compared to 20.6 million, or 6.2 of net sales, for the same period a year ago. The increase in income from operations was primarily driven by a decrease in operating expenses and an increase in gross margin as a percent of net sales in the current year period.

Wholesale net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 84.0 million compared to 99.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in net sales in the current year period was attributed to non-recurring sales following the change to a distributor model in Canada in November 2023 and temporarily elevated commercial military footwear sales to a single customer throughout 2023. In addition to the aforementioned non-recurring sales, the decrease in Wholesale sales can be attributed to a more mild climate in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year quarter as well as lean inventory on some key styles in the current period. 
 
 Re tail net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 26.8 million compared to 24.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in Retail net sales for the third quarter of 2024 was due to increased sales in our Lehigh CustomFit platform as a result of completing a realignment of our sales organization which allowed us to expand our customer base and increase offerings to current customers. 
 
 Contract Manufacturing net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.8 million compared to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was due to a multi-year contract awarded with the U.S. Military in the fourth quarter of 2023.

T he higher Wholesale gross margins in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023 was attributable to lower promotional activity in the current year period as well as opportunistic sales to certain international and key wholesale partners in the third quarter of 2023, which contributed to lower gross margins in the prior year period. 
 
 Retail gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.7 million, or 43.6 of net sales, compared to 11.8 million, or 48.0 of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in gross margin as a percent of net sales was attri butable to our Lehigh CustomFit platform having a higher percentage of total retail sales than our e-commerce branded websites, which carry lower margin than our branded e-commerce websites. 
 
 Contract Manufacturing gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.4 million, or 12.0 of net sales, compared to 0.2 million, or 11.5 of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in gross margin was driven by increased sales to the U.S. Military which carried higher margins than private label sales.

 Retail net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 83.3 million compared to 79.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . T he increase in Retail net sales was due to increased sales in our Lehigh CustomFit platform as we continue to expand our customer base and offerings to current customers.

The increase in Wholesale gross margin as a percent of net sales was due to the divestiture of the Servus brand in March 2023, which carried lower gross margins than the rest of our product portfolio, as well as product mix.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our principal source of liquidity has been our income from operations. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our primary use of cash was payments on our credit facilities. Our working capital consists primarily of trade receivables and inventory, offset by short-term debt and accounts payable. Our working capital fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal business cycle and business expansion and is generally lowest in the months of January through March of each year and highest during the months of May through October of each year. We typically utilize our revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working capital requirements. As a result, balances on our revolving credit facility can fluctuate significantly throughout the year. 
 
 Our capital expenditures relate primarily to projects relating to our offices, property, merchandising fixtures, molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing and distribution operations and for information technology. 
 
 We lease certain machinery, a distribution center in Reno, Nevada, and manufacturing facilities under operating leases that generally provide for renewal options. 
 
 We believe that our ABL Facility, coupled with cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and debt obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our continued liquidity, however, is contingent upon future operating performance, cash flows and our ability to meet financial covenants under our credit facility. For more information regarding our credit facility see Note 10 - Long Term Debt of our Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Litigation 
 
 The Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Unless otherwise stated, we believe that the likelihood of the resolution being materially adverse to our financial statements is remote and as such have not recorded any contingent liabilities within the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Historically, actual results have not been materially different from the Company s estimates. However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 We have identified the critical accounting policies used in determining estimates and assumptions in the amounts reported in our Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 There have been no material changes to our market risk as disclosed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 , our disclosure controls and procedures were (1) designed to ensure that material information relating to our Company is accumulated and made known to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, in a timely manner, particularly during the period in which this report was being prepared, and (2) effective, in that they provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 Management believes, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
