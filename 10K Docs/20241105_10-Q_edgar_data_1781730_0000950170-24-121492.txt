CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, should, could, predict, potential, believe, will likely result, expect, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, would and outlook, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 
 There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates; 

market conditions and economic trends generally and in the banking industry; 

our ability to maintain important deposit relationships; 

our ability to grow or maintain our deposit base; 

our ability to implement our expansion strategy; 

our geographic concentration in the Greater Houston market, Dallas-Fort Worth market, and Austin-San Antonio market; 

changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity; 

changes in value of the collateral securing our loans; 

credit risk associated with our business; 

credit risks associated with our real estate and construction lending; 

the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses; 

the amount of nonperforming and classified assets that we hold; 

our borrowers ability to repay loans; 

the risk of fraud related to our asset-based lending and commercial finance products; 

additional debt or future issuances of new debt securities or preferred stock; 

our ability to raise additional capital in the future; 

changes in key management personnel; 

the accuracy of the valuation techniques we use in evaluating collateral; 

competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services; 

systems failures, fraudulent activity, interruptions or data breaches involving our information technology and communications systems of third parties; 

natural disasters and other catastrophes; 

changes in the laws, rules, regulations, interpretations or policies relating to financial institution, accounting, tax, trade, monetary and fiscal matters; 

the rise of Artificial Intelligence as a commonly used resource in banking; 

ii 

monetary policies and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve 

the sustainment of an active, liquid market for our common stock; 

fluctuations in the market price of our common stock; and 

other factors that are discussed in Part II Other Information Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2024. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Mortgage-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with varying maturities. The characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, such as prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder. Accordingly, the term of mortgage-backed securities approximates the term of the underlying mortgages and can vary

There were investments in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024, and investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, allowance for credit losses has been recognized on available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available-for-sale securities and in consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. In addition, a portion of our investments are guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Treasury, or municipalities. Furthermore, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available-for-sale in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. There were securities pledged as collateral as of September 30, 2024 a nd December 31, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, proceeds from the sales of securities and their gross gains were million and respectively, and proceeds from the sales of securities and their gross losses were million and , respectively.

Non-accrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. As mentioned in Note 1, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due, which is generally when a loan is 90 days past due.

Restructured Loans and Loan Modifications Pursuant to the of ASU 2022-02 effective , the Company prospectively discontinued the recognition and measurement of TDRs. This guidance eliminated TDR accounting for loans in which the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and the creditor was granted a concession. A loan is now considered modified under ASU 2022-02 if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan has been modified. Modifications may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loans were modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The table below presents the amortized cost basis of loans at period end that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the year ended December 31, 2023, by class and type of modification. 

On an ongoing basis, the performance of modified loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is monitored for subsequent payment default. Payment default is recognized when the borrower is 90 days or more past due. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were modified loans in the previous twelve-month period that were in default.

Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless (i) management has a reasonable expectation that a loan to an individual borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty will be modified or (ii) such extension or renewal options are not unconditionally cancellable by us and, in such cases, the borrower is likely to meet applicable conditions and likely to request extension or renewal. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including U.S. Unemployment, GDP and Case-Shiller U.S National Home Price Index. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for portfolios of loans when similar risk characteristics exist. Credit loss expense related to loans reflects the totality of actions taken on all loans for a particular period including any necessary increases or decreases in the allowance related to changes in credit loss expectations associated with specific loans or pools of loans. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate appropriateness of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. Common characteristics and risk profiles include the type/purpose of loan, underlying collateral, geographical similarity and historical/expected credit loss patterns. In developing these loan pools for the purposes of modeling expected credit losses, we also analyzed the degree of correlation in how loans within each portfolio respond when subjected to varying economic conditions and scenarios as well as other portfolio stress factors. For modeling purposes, we use loan call report codes to identify the pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is necessary. We have elected to use the discounted cash flow DCF method for estimating accumulated credit losses for all loans except for consumer loans and leases. The DCF method allows for an effective incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts that can be applied in a consistent and objective manner. The method also aligns well with other calculations outside the accumulated credit loss estimations which mitigate model risk in other areas such as fair value or exit price notion calculations, interest rate risk calculations, profitability analysis, asset-liability management, and other forms of cash flow analysis. We have elected to use the weighted-average remaining maturity WARM method for consumer loans and leases. The long-term average loss rate is calculated and applied on a quarterly basis for the remaining life of the pool. Adjustments for economic expectations are made in the qualitative portion of the calculation. The long-term average loss rate is derived using peer data derived from the call report. There may be certain financial assets for which the expectation of credit loss is zero after evaluating historical loss information, making necessary adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, and considering any collateral or guarantee

A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral.

GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of cumulative benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. GAAP also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties.

 million and million, respectively. In order to calculate its ROU assets and lease liabilities, ASC Topic 842 requires the Company to use the rate of interest implicit in the lease when readily determinable. If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company is required to use its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment. The Company was unable to determine the implicit interest rate in any of the leases and therefore used its incremental borrowing rate. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average discount rate for the Company's operating leases was . The Company's lease terms range from less than to .

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Management evaluates each customer s credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank's policy for obtaining collateral and the nature of such collateral is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed in the table above, less those obligations which the Company has the unconditional right to cancel. No allowance is recognized if the issuer has an unconditional right to cancel the obligation. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet exposures was million and million, respectively, and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include the following at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: Loans Evaluated Individually for Expected Credit Losses. At September 30, 2024, collateral dependent loans with a specific valuation allowance had carrying values of million and specific valuation allowances totaling million resulting in a net fair value of million based on Level 3 inputs. At December 31, 2023, collateral dependent loans with a specific valuation allowance had carrying values of million and specific valuation allowances totaling million resulting in a net fair value of million based on Level 3 inputs. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis may include certain foreclosed assets which, upon initial recognition, are remeasured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses and certain foreclosed assets which, subsequent to their initial recognition, are remeasured at fair value through a write-down included in current earnings. The fair value of a foreclosed asset is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on observable market data or Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria. 

Charge-offs recognized in the allowance for loan losses 

Fair value of foreclosed assets remeasured at initial recognition 

The Company did t have any foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2023. Foreclosed assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. For the Company, as for most financial institutions, substantially all of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments as defined. Many of the Company s financial instruments, however, lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction. The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. In addition, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately and , respectively, was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized as a reduction of interest expense on discontinued hedges. Fair Value Hedges The Company offers certain interest rate swap products directly to its qualified commercial banking customers. These financial instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. The interest rate swap derivative positions relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. An interest rate swap transaction allows customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In connection with each swap, the Company agrees to pay interest on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for its customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts are designed to offset each other and would not significantly impact the Company s operating results except in certain situations where

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 7, 2024. Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Form 10-Q to we, our, us, and the Company refer to Third Coast Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, references in this Form 10-Q to the Bank refer to Third Coast Bank, a Texas banking association and our wholly owned bank subsidiary, and references in this Form 10-Q to TCCC refer to Third Coast Commercial Capital, Inc., a Texas corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. 
 The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024 and in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law. 
 Overview 
 We are a bank holding company with headquarters in Humble, Texas that operates through our wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, and the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, TCCC. We focus on providing commercial banking solutions to small and medium-sized businesses and professionals with operations in our markets. Our market expertise, coupled with a deep understanding of our customers needs, allows us to deliver tailored financial products and services. We currently operate nineteen branches, with ten branches in the Greater Houston market, three branches in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, five branches in the Austin-San Antonio market, and one branch in Detroit, Texas. As of September 30, 2024, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of 4.63 billion, total loans of 3.89 billion, total deposits of 3.99 billion and total shareholders equity of 450.5 million. 
 As a bank holding company that operates through one segment, community banking, we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans, and customer service and loan fees. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds, as well as noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest-earning assets and control the interest expenses of our liabilities, measured as net interest income, through our net interest margin and net interest spread. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and interest-bearing time deposits in other banks, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between average rates earned on interest-earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Changes in market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as in the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and noninterest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Texas, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our target markets and throughout the state of Texas. 
 Registration of Securities Issued in Private Placement 
 The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on September 25, 2024 registering the resale from time to time by the securityholders named therein of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Preferred Warrants issued to such securityholders in the private placement completed on September 30, 2022 and the securities issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Non-Voting Common Stock, or upon exercise of the Preferred Warrants. The Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 4, 2024. 
 Conversion to State Bank 
 On March 13, 2024, the Bank completed its conversion from a Texas state savings bank to a Texas banking association. As a result of the conversion, the Texas Department of Banking is the Bank s primary state regulator and the Federal Reserve is the Bank s primary federal regulator. The Federal Reserve continues to be the Company s primary federal regulator. The Bank remains as a member of the Federal Reserve System.

Results of Operations 
 Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income and noninterest income. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our level of our noninterest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment and other miscellaneous operating expenses. See the analysis of the material fluctuations in the related discussions that follow.

Net Interest Income 
 Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, calculated as the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Fluctuations in market interest rates impact the yield and rates paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. Changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities also impact our net interest income. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income increased 15.1 million, or 14.8 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased interest income from loan growth and increased yields on loans offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from interest-bearing deposit growth and increased rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. Average loans increased from 3.29 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.74 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with the growth well diversified in real estate loans and commercial loans. The yield on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.84 compared to 7.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense related to interest bearing deposit accounts was 119.5 million and 77.4 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average interest-bearing deposits increased from 2.65 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.38 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 3.91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense related to borrowings was 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in FHLB advances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.65 and 2.76 , respectively, compared to 3.77 and 2.91 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The following table presents an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated, including average outstanding balances for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid on such amounts, and the average rate earned or paid on such assets or liabilities, respectively. The table also sets forth the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income increased 5.1 million, or 14.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased interest income from loan growth and increased yields on loans offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from deposit growth and increased rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. Average loans increased from 3.42 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.80 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, with the growth well diversified in real estate loans and commercial loans. The yield on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.90 compared to 7.57 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense related to interest bearing deposit accounts was 40.4 million and 30.3 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average interest-bearing deposits increased from 2.76 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.38 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 4.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin and net interest spread were 3.73 and 2.82 , respectively, compared to 3.71 and 2.79 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The following table presents an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated, including average outstanding balances for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid on such amounts, and the average rate earned or paid on such assets or liabilities, respectively.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 Provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses accounts for various types of financial instruments, including loans, securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures, to bring the allowances to a level which, in management's best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. Prior to the January 1, 2023 adoption of ASC 326, the provision for credit losses was an expense we used to maintain an allowance for credit losses for loans at a level which was deemed appropriate by management to absorb inherent losses on existing loans. 
 The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.5 million compared to 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.1 million compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provisions for each period related primarily to provisioning for new loans and commitments booked during the periods. No provision for credit losses for securities was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for loans totaled 39.7 million, or 1.02 of total loans, compared to 37.0 million, or 1.02 of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments was 1.8 million compared to 2.4 million at December 31, 2023. No allowance for credit losses for securities was recorded as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 See the sections captioned Allowance for Credit Losses and Securities elsewhere in this discussion for additional information regarding the provision for credit losses related to loans, off-balance sheet credit exposures and securities. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are service charges and other fees, earnings from bank-owned life insurance and our investment in the Small Business Investment Company, gains from the sale of SBA loans and securities, and derivative fees.

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The increase in noninterest income of 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to increased service charges and fees and increased earnings on bank-owned life insurance, offset by losses on the sales of investment securities and a decrease in derivative and advisory fee income. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The increase in noninterest income of 651,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to increased service charges and fees, offset by losses on the sales of investment securities. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Generally, noninterest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining customer relationships and providing bank services. The largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy expenses, depreciation and amortization of our facilities and our furniture, fixtures and office equipment, legal and professional fees, data processing and network expenses, regulatory fees, including Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC assessments, marketing expenses, and loan operations and repossessed asset related expenses.

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The increase in noninterest expense of 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefit expenses, increased expenses related to new branch locations, increases in regulatory assessments, and investment in new technology and software. The increase in noninterest expense was offset by a decrease in legal and professional fees. 
 Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of noninterest expense and include payroll expense, the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. Salaries and employee benefits were 48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.0 million, or 4.3 , compared to 46.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to annual wage increases and merit awards, offset by workforce reductions during 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average number of employees was 361 compared to an average number of employees of 371 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net occupancy and equipment expenses were 9.4 million and 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Building, leasehold, furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation and software amortization included in net occupancy and equipment expense totaled 4.2 million and 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases were primarily due to costs associated with opening three branch locations during 2024. 
 Legal and professional fees decreased from 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The addition of in-house counsel and information technology specialists reduced external legal fees and information technology consulting costs. 
 Regulatory assessment fees increased from 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to our growth in total assets from 4.22 billion at September 30, 2023 to 4.63 billion at September 30, 2024 and a change in our quarterly assessment rate. 
 The Company's software-related expenditures, including software purchases and maintenance, amounted to 2.5 million and 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase in these expenses is attributed to our 
 48 

continued investment towards adopting new and advanced technology and software aimed at achieving greater efficiency in lending and deposit processes and management of risk. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The decrease in noninterest expense of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefit expenses, decreased expenses related to legal and professional fees, and decreased other expenses, offset by increased expenses related to new branch locations and increases in regulatory assessments. 
 Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of noninterest expense and include payroll expense, the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. Salaries and employee benefits were 15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.7 million, or 9.6 , compared to 17.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to workforce reductions in 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 358 employees compared to 369 employees at September 30, 2023. 
 Net occupancy and equipment expenses were 3.2 million and 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Building, leasehold, furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation and software amortization included in net occupancy and equipment expenses totaled 1.4 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases were primarily due to costs associated with opening three branch locations in 2024. 
 Legal and professional fees decreased from 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The addition of in-house counsel and information technology specialists reduced external legal fees and information technology consulting costs. 
 Regulatory assessment fees increased from 532,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to our growth in total assets from 4.22 billion at September 30, 2023 to 4.63 billion at September 30, 2024 and a change in our quarterly assessment rate. 
 Other noninterest expenses were 1.1 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. ACH and deposit account related fraud losses decreased from 467,000 in the third quarter of 2023 to 99,000 in the third quarter of 2024. In addition, the Company's expense reduction initiatives resulted in reduced insurance costs, employee award program costs, and regulatory filing fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The amount of income tax expense we incur is impacted by the amounts of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at current income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

Financial Condition 
 Total assets were 4.63 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 4.40 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets of 231.7 million was primarily due to organic loan growth and the purchase of investment securities and non-marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increases were funded primarily by the growth in total deposits, earnings, and the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loan Portfolio 
 Our primary source of income is derived through interest earned on loans to small-to medium-sized businesses, commercial companies, professionals and individuals located in our primary market areas. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial loans and real estate loans secured by commercial real estate properties located in our primary market areas. Our loan portfolio represents the highest yielding component of our earning assets. 
 As of September 30, 2024, total loans were 3.89 billion, an increase of 251.0 million, or 6.9 , compared to 3.64 billion as of December 31, 2023. Commercial and industrial and real estate loans accounted for the majority of the loan growth with commercial and industrial loans increasing 236.2 million and real estate loans increasing 108.4 million from December 31, 2023. The growth was partially offset by a 93.0 million decrease in municipal loans from December 31, 2023. Total loans as a percentage of deposits were 
 49 

97.4 and 95.7 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total loans as a percentage of assets were 84.1 and 82.8 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans are underwritten primarily based on cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, the value of the underlying collateral. These loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the portfolio are located primarily throughout our markets and are generally diverse in terms of type. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry. 
 Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are a key component of our lending strategy to owner-operated businesses, representing a large percentage of our total commercial real estate loans. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans decreased 50.6 million, or 9.7 , to 470.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from 520.8 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are loans for income producing properties and are generally for retail strip centers, office buildings, self-storage facilities, and multi and single tenant office warehouses, all within our markets. Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans increased 25.0 million, or 4.3 , to 611.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from 586.6 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential real estate loans consist of 1-4 family residential loans and multi-family residential loans. Our 1-4 family residential loan portfolio is predominately comprised of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, which are investor owned. While we do have some owner-occupied 1-4 family residential loans, we have not historically pursued this product line; however, we do offer limited mortgage products through our mortgage department. Our multi-family residential loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by properties deemed multi-family, which includes apartment buildings. Our current multifamily loans are to operators who we believe are seasoned and successful and possess quality alternative repayment sources. Residential real estate loans decreased 3.0 million, or 0.9 , to 339.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from 342.6 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Construction, Development and Other Loans. Construction and development loans are comprised of loans used to fund construction, land acquisition and land development. The properties securing the portfolio are primarily in the Greater Houston and Dallas markets and are generally diverse in terms of type. During 2021, we expanded our construction and development portfolio through the formation of our builder finance group, which provides traditional homebuilder lines secured by lots and single-family homes, and land acquisition and development loans. This group also finances bond anticipation notes and lines of credit to large national institutional tier-one funds that invest equity in various real estate assets. Construction, development and other loans increased 131.7 million, or 19.0 , to 825.3 million as of September 30, 2024 from 693.6 million as of December 31, 2023 due primarily to the additional productivity from the builder finance group. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower's ability to operate profitably and effectively. These loans are primarily made based on the borrower's ability to service the debt from income. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and generally include personal guarantees. Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio consists of loans principally to retail trade, service, and manufacturing firms located in our market areas. 
 In addition, the commercial and industrial loan category includes factored receivables. TCCC provides working capital solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses throughout the United States. TCCC provides working capital financing through the purchase of accounts receivables. Our factored receivables portfolio consists primarily of customers in the transportation, energy services and service industries. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, outstanding factored receivables were 38.0 million and 26.5 million, respectively. 
 Commercial and industrial loans increased 236.2 million, or 18.7 , to 1.50 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 1.26 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of increased productivity in response to market demand.

Other Loan Categories. Other categories of loans included in our loan portfolio include municipal loans, farmland loans, consumer loans, agricultural loans made to farmers and ranchers relating to their operations and lease financing. None of these categories of loans represents a material portion of our total loan portfolio. 
 The contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with fixed and floating interest rates in each maturity range as of the date indicated are summarized in the following tables:

Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, loans that are accruing over 90 days past due, restructured loans - accruing, and foreclosed assets. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2022-02, which discontinued the recognition and measurement guidance previously required on troubled debt restructurings. Therefore, restructured loans included in nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2024 exclude any loan modifications that are performing but would have previously required disclosure as troubled debt restructurings. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become more than 90 days past due and/or collection of principal or interest is in doubt.

We had 24.3 million in nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2024 compared to 17.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Included in nonperforming assets, nonperforming loans were 24.0 million and 17.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily the result of five commercial and industrial loans totaling 2.9 million and one commercial real estate loan relationship consisting of four loans totaling 7.8 million being placed on nonaccrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Three of the commercial and industrial loans totaling 1.7 million have a 75 SBA guaranty and are paying as agreed. The loan value on the real estate supporting the four commercial real estate loans is 69 and management does not anticipate a loss on this relationship. The increase in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans was partially offset by nonaccrual loan charge-offs of 1.9 million and paydowns on nonaccrual loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 In accordance with ASC 326 which the Company adopted January 1, 2023, the allowance for credit losses on loans is estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan based on current expected credit losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on the Company's loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing the exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the loan. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance for credit losses is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our loan portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. On January 1, 2023, we recorded an increase of 4.0 million to the allowance for credit losses for the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 326 for our loan portfolio. For additional information on adoption of ASC 326, see Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses below and Note 1 Nature of Operations 
 52 

and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, we maintained an allowance for credit losses that represented management s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance for credit losses was not an indicator that charge-offs in future periods would necessarily occur in those amounts. In determining the allowance for credit losses, we estimated losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss could be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for credit losses was based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of our loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates, among other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for loans totaled 39.7 million, or 1.02 of total loans. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses for loans totaled 37.0 million, or 1.02 of total loans. The increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans was primarily due to the 5.2 million provision for credit losses on loans recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 partially offset by 2.5 million of net charge-offs. 
 The following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for credit losses and other related data:

Securities 
 Our investment portfolio consists of U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, and corporate bonds classified as available-for-sale. The carrying value of such 
 53 

securities is adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. 
 Management assesses securities in its investment portfolio for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an investment may be impaired. In accordance with ASC 326, available-for-sale securities are evaluated as of each reporting date when the fair value is less than amortized cost, and credit losses are to be calculated individually using a discounted cash flow method through which management compares the present value of the expected cash flows with the amortized costs. An allowance for credit losses is established to reflect the credit loss component of the decline in fair value. 
 Factors management considers in assessing whether a discounted cash flow method evaluation is needed for a security whose fair value is less than amortized costs include: (1) management will assess whether it intends to sell, or if it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; (2) the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the market value has been less than costs; (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer, such as changes in technology that impair the earnings potential of the investment or the discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect the future earnings potential; and (4) changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency. Based on management's analysis, an allowance for credit losses for the security portfolio was not deemed to be needed as of September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the security portfolio was 292.1 million compared to 178.1 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 114.0 million, or 64.0 . The increase relates primarily to net purchases of 2.53 billion in agencies, municipal securities, mortgage-back securities and corporate bonds offset by maturities, calls and paydowns of 2.42 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Investment securities represented 6.3 and 4.1 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The mortgage-backed securities held include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae securities. We do not hold any preferred stock, corporate equity, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, structured investment vehicles, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, subprime, Alt-A or second lien elements in our investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio did not contain any securities that are directly backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages. 
 The contractual maturity of a mortgage-backed security is the date at which the last underlying mortgage matures. The contractual maturities of the mortgage-backed securities held range from 2026 to 2065 and are not a reliable indicator of the expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Mortgage-backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgage loans and other loans with varying maturities. The terms of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary significantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities tend to cause the average life of the securities to be much different than the stated contractual maturity. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal, and, consequently, the average life of the security is typically lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated life of the security. Therefore, schedules of maturities for mortgage-backed securities have been excluded from this disclosure.

Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Advances. The FHLB allows us to borrow on a blanket floating lien status collateralized by FHLB stocks and real estate loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, borrowing capacity available under this arrangement was 560.4 million and 565.1 million, respectively. We had no FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Our cost of FHLB advances was 5.25 and 5.43 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, letters of credit with the FHLB in the amount of 514.9 million and 463.1 million were outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The letters of credit are used to collateralize public fund deposit accounts in excess of FDIC insurance limits and have expirations ranging from October 2024 through October 2025. 
 Line of Credit - Senior Debt. The Company has a 55.0 million revolving line of credit facility that was modified effective March 12, 2024, whereby the facility was increased by 5.0 million and the note rate was decreased to The Wall Street Journal US Prime Rate, as such changes from time to time, less 0.625 , with a floor rate of 5.00 per annum. Interest continues to be payable quarterly on the 10 th day of March, June, September and December through maturity date of March 10, 2026. All principal and unpaid interest is due at maturity. The note is secured by 100 of the outstanding stock of the Bank and is senior in rights to the subordinated debt described below. Prior to the modification, the 50.0 million facility was due on September 10, 2024, and bore interest at The Wall Street Journal US Prime Rate, as such changes from time to time, plus 0.50 , with a floor rate of 5.00 per annum. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance was 31.9 million and 38.9 million, respectively. 
 Note Payable - Subordinated Debt . On March 31, 2022, the Company issued and sold 82.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 82.3 million in outstanding principal and 1.6 million and 1.7 million, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs. For additional information on our Note Payable - Subordinated Debt, see Note 7 FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 Our cost of our senior debt and note payable was 6.66 and 6.69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Federal Reserve Borrower-in-Custody (BIC) Loan Pledge Arrangement. In June 2023, the Federal Reserve Bank approved the Company to begin pledging, on a blanket floating lien status, its commercial and industrial loans under a Borrower-in-Custody BIC arrangement. The arrangement provides the Company with the ability to secure collateralized contingency funding from the Discount Window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total borrowing capacity under this arrangement was 1.4 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. There were no advances outstanding at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Federal Funds Lines of Credit. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had federal funds lines of credit with commercial banks that provide for availability to borrow up to an aggregate of 36.5 million. The Company had no advances outstanding under these lines at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity involves our ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, liquidity needs were primarily met by core deposits, loan maturities, amortizing loan portfolios, brokered deposits, and borrowings. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowing capacity available under FHLB advances of 560.4 million, line of credit - senior debt of 23.1 million, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Discount Window of 1.4 billion, and federal funds lines of credit of 36.5 million. At December 31, 2023, the Company had borrowing capacity under FHLB advances of 565.1 million, line of credit - senior debt of 11.1 million, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Discount Window of 1.2 billion, and federal funds lines of credit of 36.5 million.

Our primary source of funds is deposits, and our primary use of funds is loans. We do not expect a change in the primary source or use of our funds in the foreseeable future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.44 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit and 21.2 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we had 1.35 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit and 26.9 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditure of a material nature. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 270.5 million, compared to 411.8 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Capital Resources 
 Total shareholders equity increased to 450.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 412.0 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 38.6 million, or 9.4 . This increase was primarily the result of the 33.9 million in net income and 6.9 million of other comprehensive income on securities and derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by the 3.6 million of dividends declared on the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Capital management consists of providing equity and other instruments that qualify as regulatory capital to support current and future operations. Banking regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution s financial soundness. We are required to comply with certain risk-based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. 
 As of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the FDIC s prompt corrective action regulations. As we deploy our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control our growth in order to remain in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to accommodate the business requirements of our customers. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 During September 2024 and as part of our hedging strategy, we entered into a five-year pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million. The facility is scheduled to mature on September 4, 2029. The instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge and changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 During December 2023, we entered into two five-year pay-fixed interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of 100 million each. The facilities, which were scheduled to mature on December 6, 2028 and December 21, 2028, were discontinued on April 10, 2024, and a combined gain of 5.4 million was recognized by the Company. The gain is being accreted from other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, into interest expense through the maturity date of the contracts. 
 During March 2023, we entered into a five-year pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 200 million. The facility, which was scheduled to mature on March 31, 2028, was discontinued on May 26, 2023, and a gain of 5.0 million was recognized by the Company. The gain is being accreted from other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, into interest expense through the maturity date of the contract. 
 During July 2022, we entered into a five-year pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 200 million on its floating rate deposits. The facility, which was designated as a cash flow hedge, was discontinued on August 24, 2022, and a gain on the terminated hedge of 3.0 million was recognized by the Company. The gain is being accreted from other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, into interest expense through the maturity date of the contract, or July 9, 2027. 
 On February 18, 2021, a 100.0 million pay-fixed interest rate swap facility designated as a cash flow hedge was discontinued and a gain on the terminated hedge of 945,000 was recognized by the Company. The gain is being accreted from other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, into interest expense through the maturity date of the contract, or September 4, 2025. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 2.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively, was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized as a reduction of interest expense on discontinued hedges. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 756,000 and 450,000, respectively, was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized as a reduction of interest expense on discontinued hedges. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 We also offer certain interest rate swap products directly to our qualified commercial banking customers. These financial instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. The interest rate swap derivative positions relate to transactions in which we enter into an interest rate swap with a customer, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. An interest rate swap transaction allows customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In connection with each swap, we agree to pay interest on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, we agree to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. 
 Because we act as an intermediary for our customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts are designed to offset each other and would not significantly impact our operating results except in certain situations where there is a significant deterioration in the customer s credit worthiness or that of the counterparties. At September 30, 2024, no such deterioration was determined by management. 
 We also offer one-way interest rate swap products to our customers. Under this type of arrangement, we extend a conventional fixed-rate loan to the borrower and then subsequently hedge the interest rate risk of that loan by entering into a swap for our own balance sheet to convert the fixed-rate loan to a synthetic floating rate asset. These types of swaps lock in our spread over our cost of funds for the life of the loan. 
 For some of our loan participation facilities, we enter into RPAs with other banks in order to hedge or share a portion of the risk of borrower default related to the interest rate swap on a participated loan. 
 All derivatives are carried at fair value in either other assets or other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024, our derivative assets and liabilities totaled 5.8 million and 6.9 million, respectively. 
 For additional information regarding derivatives, see Note 17 Derivative Financial Instruments, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for 
 58 

monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a decrease in current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, financial options, financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank's Asset Liability and Investment Committee, in accordance with policies approved by the Bank s board of directors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital on the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and an interest rate shock simulation model. 
 We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model, as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. The average life of our non-maturity deposit accounts are updated annually and are incorporated into the model. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 On a monthly basis, we run simulation models including a static balance sheet. The models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static model, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rate changes over a 12-month horizon based upon parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. In addition to the monthly reports, we also run various scenarios based on market trends and management analysis needs. These special reports include stress test reports, reports to test the deposit decay rates and growth reports based on budget. Our internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 25.0 for a 200 basis point shift and 35.0 for a 300 basis point shift. 
 The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon as of the dates indicated:

The results are primarily due to behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits during such rate fluctuations. We have found that, historically, interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our financial reporting and accounting policies conform to GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations. Our accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We believe that of our accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity: 
 Allowance for Credit Losses . The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for portfolios of loans when similar risk characteristics exist. Expected credit losses for collateral dependent loans, including loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty but foreclosure is not probable, are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. 
 The provision for credit losses related to loans reflects the totality of actions taken on all loans for a particular period including any necessary increases or decreases in the allowance related to changes in credit loss expectations associated with specific loans or pools of loans. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate appropriateness of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications. 
 Determining the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management s assessment of overall portfolio quality. The Company maintains the allowance at an amount the Company believes is sufficient to provide for estimated current expected credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for credit losses may result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on the Company s allowance, and therefore the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
 Transfers of Financial Assets. Management accounts for the transfers of financial assets as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control is surrendered when the assets have been isolated, a transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and there is no agreement to repurchase the assets before their maturity. Management believes the loan participations sold subject to this guidance met the condition to be treated as a sale. 
 Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event triggering impairment may have occurred. 
 Core deposit intangibles are acquired customer relationships arising from bank acquisitions and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Core deposit intangibles are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. As an emerging growth company, the Company has taken advantage of reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. Emerging growth companies are: 
 exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from the Company s auditors on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 

permitted to have an extended transition period for adopting any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the FASB or by the SEC; 

permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about the Company s executive compensation arrangements; and 

not required to give shareholders nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

60 

The Company will lose its emerging growth company status upon the earliest of : (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the Company has 1.235 billion or more in annual revenues; (ii) the date on which the Company becomes a large accelerated filer (the fiscal year end on which the total market value of the Company's common equity securities held by non-affiliates is 700 million or more as of June 30); (iii) the date on which the Company issues more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or (iv) December 31, 2026, which is the end of the fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of the Company's initial public offering occurs.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. We are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and litigation may include, among other things, allegations of violation of banking and other applicable regulations, competition law, labor laws and consumer protection laws, as well as claims or litigation relating to intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation. 
 At this time, in the opinion of management, the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention and may materially and adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In evaluating an investment in any of our securities, investors should consider carefully, among other things, information under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Form 10-Q and such other risk factors as we may disclose in other reports and statements filed with the SEC. There have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed by the Company in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024.
