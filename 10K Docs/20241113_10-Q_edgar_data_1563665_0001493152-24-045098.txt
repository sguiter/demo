million and will require additional financing to fund future operations. The Company expects that its operating cash on-hand as
of September 30, 2024 of approximately million will enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
into the second quarter of 2025. Therefore, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. 

The
Company will need to raise additional capital to fund its current operations. In the event the Company is unable to raise additional
capital from outside sources during the first quarter of 2025, it may be forced to curtail or cease its operations. 

Cash
requirements and cash resource needs will vary significantly depending upon the timing of the financial and other resource needs that
will be required to complete ongoing development, pre-clinical and clinical testing of product candidates, as well as regulatory efforts
and collaborative arrangements necessary for the Company s product candidates that are currently under development. The Company
is currently seeking and will continue to seek financing from other existing and/or new investors to raise necessary funds through a
combination of public or private equity offerings. The Company may also pursue debt financings, other financing mechanisms, research
grants, or strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements. The Company may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable
terms, if at all. 

The
Company s operations will be adversely affected if it is unable to raise or obtain needed funding and may materially affect the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and therefore, the condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amount
and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Apparatus Regenerative Technology, Inc. is referred to herein as we, our, us , and the
Company . 

Business
Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of regenerative medicine treatments for disorders of the gastro-intestinal
system and other organs that result from cancer, trauma or birth defects. 

We
believe that our technology represents a next generation solution for restoring organ function because it allows the patient to regenerate
their own organ, thus eliminating the need for human donor or animal transplants, the sacrificing of another of the patient s own
organs or permanent artificial implants. 

Our
first esophageal product candidate, our esophageal implant was used in the first successful regeneration of the esophagus in a patient
with esophageal cancer. This successful first-in-human experience, plus the research we have performed on over 50 pigs, led the FDA to
approve our 10-patient phase 1 clinical trial. This combination trial will measure both safety and efficacy in the patient population. 

We
have contracted with IQVIA, a leading global provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions and clinical research services to the
life sciences industry, as the contract research organization CRO to manage our first clinical trial. We activated the
first clinical trial site and started screening patients in the third quarter of 2023. 

We
have encountered delays in patient recruitment for our ongoing clinical trial, driven by several factors, including the existing comorbid
conditions for clinical trial participants, the stringent eligibility criteria required by FDA for our studies, and logistical difficulties
in enrolling participants across various sites. 

Although
we are actively implementing strategies to mitigate these challenges, such as increasing the number of trial sites and enhancing patient
outreach efforts, there is a risk that these measures may not completely resolve the recruitment issues. Our product candidates are currently
in development and have not yet received regulatory approval for sale anywhere in the world. 

In
addition to our development of regenerative medicine treatments, we also sell dietary supplements. In the second quarter of
2023, the Company s subsidiary in Hong Kong, Consumer Health Products started focusing on consumer health products. Consumer Health Products plans
to include a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare including dietary supplements. Consumer Health Products started
selling consumer health supplements in the third quarter of 2023. These products are commercially marketed to the general public and initially
targeted at consumers in the Great China Region through eCommerce (online sales). 

17 

We
were incorporated and commenced operations on November 1, 2013 as a result of a spin-off from Harvard Bioscience, Inc., or Harvard Bioscience.
On that date, we became an independent company that operates the regenerative medicine business previously owned by Harvard Bioscience.
The spin-off was completed through the distribution of all the shares of common stock of Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology to
Harvard Bioscience stockholders. 

We
continue to assess the market and regulatory approval pathway in China as to our implant products. We are not certain at this time as
to which market, including U.S. or China for example, may provide the most viable initial pathway for regulatory approval to a commercial
product. This will depend on a number of factors, including the approval and development processes, related costs, ability to raise capital
and the terms and conditions thereof, among other factors. Any development and capital raising efforts in China may include a joint venture
in relation to our Hong Kong subsidiary, and would also involve a number of commercial variables, including rights and obligations pertaining
to licensing, development, and financing, among others. Our failure to receive or obtain such clearances or approvals on a timely basis
or at all, whether that be in the U.S., China or otherwise, would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Since
our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our programs, building our intellectual property
portfolio, business planning, raising capital and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations. To date,
we have financed our operations with proceeds from the sales of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. In December 2017, we sold the inventory
and rights to manufacture and sell research-only versions of our bioreactors to Harvard Bioscience. 

Business
Segments 

The
Company has two separate reportable segments. The Company has one segment, Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology, Inc., or Regenerative
Biotech, focused on the development and commercialization of therapies to cure patients of cancers, injuries, and birth defects of the
gastro-intestinal tract and the airways. The other segment, Consumer Health Products, is focused on personal healthcare including dietary supplements. 

Financial
Condition and Need for Additional Funds 

We
expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for 2024 and in future years. 

Operating
Losses and Cash Requirements 

We
have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 98.3 million and will require additional financing to fund future operations. We expect that our operating cash on-hand as of September
30, 2024 of approximately 3.6 million will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second
quarter of 2025. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for 2024 and in future years.
Therefore, as disclosed in Note 1 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
will need to raise additional capital to fund our current operations. In the event we do not raise additional capital from outside sources
during the first quarter of 2025, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. 

18 

Cash
requirements and cash resource needs will vary significantly depending upon the timing of the financial and other resource needs that
will be required to complete ongoing development, pre-clinical and clinical testing of product candidates, as well as regulatory efforts
and collaborative arrangements necessary for our product candidates that are currently under development. We are currently seeking and
will continue to seek financings from other existing and/or new investors to raise necessary funds through a combination of public or
private equity offerings. We may also pursue debt financings, other financing mechanisms, research grants, or strategic collaborations
and licensing arrangements. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. 

Our
operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to raise or obtain needed funding and may materially affect our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a
going concern and therefore, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the
possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amount and classifications of liabilities that may
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Components
of Operating Loss 

Product
revenue . Product revenue consists of consumer health product sales, launched in the Great China Region in the third quarter of 2023. We
had not generated any revenue prior to the launch of our consumer health products. 

Research
and development expense . Research and development expense consists of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation,
for personnel and contracted consultants and various materials and other costs to develop our new products, primarily: synthetic scaffolds,
including investigation and development of materials and investigation and optimization of cellularization, as well as studies of cells
and cell behavior. Other research and development expenses include the costs of outside service providers and material costs for prototype
and test units and outside laboratories and testing facilities performing cell growth and materials experiments, as well as the costs
of all other preclinical research and testing including animal studies and expenses related to potential patents. We expense research
and development costs as incurred. 

Sales
and marketing expense . Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing
and selling activities. 

General
and administrative expense . Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related expenses,
including share-based compensation. Other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services, insurance, investor relations
and facility costs. 

Other
(expense) income, net. Other (expense) income, net, consists primarily of interest expense on convertible debt and finance charges
on insurance installment payments offset by interest income. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, as well as the expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on
an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While
our significant accounting policies are discussed in more detail in Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical for
fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. 

19 

Share-based
Compensation 

We
account for our share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of current authoritative guidance.
Share-based awards, including stock options, are measured at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense over the requisite
service period (generally the vesting period), which we have elected to amortize on a straight-line basis. Expense on share-based awards
for which vesting is performance or milestone based is recognized on a straight-line basis from the date when we determine the achievement
of the milestone is probable to the vesting/milestone achievement date. Since share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately
expected to vest, it has been reduced by an estimate for future forfeitures. Until December 31, 2022, we estimated forfeitures at the
time of grant and would revise our estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods. As of January 1, 2023, we account for forfeitures as
they occur. We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Significant judgment is required
in determining the proper assumptions used in this model. The assumptions used include the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected
volatility, and expected dividend yield. We base our assumptions on historical data when available or, when not available, on a peer
group of companies. However, these assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions, which are inherently uncertain and subject
to our judgment, and therefore any changes in assumptions could significantly impact the future grant date fair value of share-based
awards.

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Product
Revenue 

Product
revenue was 59,000 and 40,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product revenue consists of consumer health
product sales, launched in the Great China Region in the third quarter of 2023. We had not generated any revenue prior to the launch
of our consumer health products. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales was 70,000 and 13,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September
30, 2024, cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products, taxes, inbound and outbound shipping costs. The gross profit
margin on our products decreased primarily due to discounted sales aimed at achieving market penetration for our newly introduced product. 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development expense increased approximately 0.2 million, or 64 , to approximately 0.5 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to approximately 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to
significant initial clinical trial activities in the prior period resulting in our first site activation in the third quarter of 2023. 

Sales
and Marketing Expense 

Selling
and marketing expense was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The headcount related costs stayed steady
over the prior period. 

General
and Administrative Expense 

General
and administrative expense decreased approximately 0.02 million, or 2 , to approximately 1.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to approximately 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to
reduced legal fees incurred during the current quarter. 

Other
(expense) income, net 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded interest expense of approximately 7,000 on convertible debt and approximately
 4,000 on insurance installment payments offset by interest income of approximately 9,000 earned from our money market account. During
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest income of approximately 18,000 earned from our money market account
and certificate of deposit offset by approximately 4,000 on insurance installment payments. In 2023, we refunded 5,000 of a deposit
not utilized, which was recorded as sublease income in 2022. 

21 

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Product
Revenue 

Product
revenue was 172,000 and 40,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product revenue consists of consumer health
product sales, launched in the Asia region in the third quarter of 2023. Sales grew as a result of broadening our distribution channels
to access a larger consumer base. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales was 95,000 and 13,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, cost of sales consists of the purchase price of consumer products, taxes, inbound and outbound shipping costs. The cost of
sales in 2024 reflects nine months of activity, following the product s launch in the Asia region during the third quarter of 2023. 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development expense decreased approximately 0.4 million, or 15 , to approximately 2.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to approximately 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to significant
initial clinical trial activities in the prior period resulting in our first site activation in the third quarter of 2023. 

Sales
and Marketing Expense 

Selling
and marketing expense was 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.02 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The Consumer Health Products business was launched in the Asia region in the third quarter of 2023. 

General
and Administrative Expense 

General
and administrative expense decreased approximately 0.6 million, or 14 , to approximately 3.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to approximately 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to share-based
compensation expense of 1.3 million from the vesting of performance based awards in the first half of 2023 offset by the recording of
expense in the current period of one-time offering costs of 0.5 million relating to the initial registered offering that did not occur
in a prior year. 

Other
(expense) income, net 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded interest expense of approximately 23,000 on convertible debt and approximately
 13,000 on insurance installment payments offset by interest income of approximately 9,000 earned from our money market account. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest income of approximately 59,000 earned from our money market account and
certificate of deposit offset by approximately 11,000 on insurance installment payments. In 2023, we refunded 5,000 of a deposit not
utilized, which was recorded as sublease income in 2022. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of liquidity. We have incurred operating losses since inception, and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 98.3 million. We are currently investing significant resources in the development and commercialization of our product candidates for
use by clinicians and researchers in the fields of regenerative medicine and bioengineering. As a result, we expect to incur operating
losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. Therefore, as disclosed in Note 1 to our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Operating
activities. Net cash used in operating activities of approximately 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was
due primarily to our net loss of approximately 6.4 million offset by adjustments for non-cash items of approximately 1.7 million due
to non-cash expenses for share-based compensation and depreciation, and an approximately 1.0 million increase to cash from changes in
working capital due to the timing of payments for accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred financing costs, long-term
prepaid contracts, accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Net
cash used in operating activities of approximately 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to our
net loss of approximately 7.1 million offset by adjustments for non-cash items of approximately 2.9 million due to non-cash expenses
for share-based compensation and depreciation, and an approximately 1.5 million decrease to cash from changes in working capital due
to the timing of payments for accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred financing costs, long-term prepaid contracts,
accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Investing
activities. Net cash used in investing activities included purchases of property, plant and equipment for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 representing approximately zero and 11,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we invested
in a certificate of deposit for 2.5 million that earned 32,000 in interest. We withdrew 1.3 million from the certificate of deposit
prior to the maturity date to pay clinical trial related deposits. The certificate of deposit matured in October 2023 with the remaining
 1.2 million released from short-term investments into cash and cash equivalents. 

Financing
activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash generated from financing activities totaled approximately 6.9
million. This included net proceeds of 0.5 million from debt financing, 0.4 million from stock warrant exercises, and 6.5 million
from private placement transactions, which resulted in the issuance of 1,756,655 shares of our Common Stock to a group of investors.
The 0.5 million in debt was repaid in August 2024. In comparison, net cash generated from financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, was approximately 6.0 million, primarily from private placement transactions that resulted in the issuance
of 1,000,967 shares of our Common Stock to a group of investors.
