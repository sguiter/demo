PUREBASE
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

on . The Company
is an industrial mineral and natural resource company that provides solutions to the agriculture and construction materials markets in
the United States through its two subsidiaries, PureBase Agricultural, Inc., a Nevada corporation PureBase AG ), and U.S.
Agricultural Minerals, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company PureBase AM ), respectively. 

The
Company s headquarters is in Ione, California. 

Agricultural
Sector 

The
Company develops specialized sun protectants. The Company has developed and will seek to develop additional products derived from mineralized
materials of kaolin clay. 

Construction
Sector 

The
Company has been developing and testing a kaolin-based product that it believes will help create a lower CO2-emitting concrete through
the use of high-quality supplementary cementitious materials SCMs ). The Company is developing an SCM that it believes
can potentially replace up to 40 of cement, the most polluting part of concrete. As government agencies continue to enact stricter requirements
for less-polluting forms of concrete, the Company believes there are significant opportunities for high-quality SCM products in the construction
materials sector. 

The
Company utilizes the services of US Mine Corporation USMC ), a Nevada corporation and a significant shareholder of the
Company, for the development and contract mining of industrial minerals. A. Scott Dockter, the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and a director, and John Bremer, a director, are also officers, directors, and owners of USMC. In addition, a substantial portion of
the minerals used by the Company are obtained from properties owned or controlled by US Mine, LLC. A. Scott Dockter, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John Bremer, a director, are also owners of US Mine, LLC. 

and a working capital deficit of . For the nine months ended
August 31, 2024, the Company had a loss from operations of and negative cash flows from operations of . The Company s
operating activities consume the majority of its cash resources. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating losses
as it executes its development plans for 2024. In addition, the Company has had and expects to have negative cash flows from operations,
at least into the near future. The Company has previously funded and plans to continue funding these losses primarily with additional
infusions of cash from advances from USMC and the sale of equity and convertible notes. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s plan, through the continued promotion of its products to existing and potential customers, is to generate sufficient
revenues to cover its anticipated expenses. The Company issued a promissory note to USMC on February 8, 2024 and received a new line
of credit from USMC on March 7, 2024, and is currently exploring several other options to meet its short-term cash requirements, including
issuances of equity securities or equity-linked securities to USMC and other third parties. 

Although
no assurances can be given as to the Company s ability to deliver on its revenue plans or that unforeseen expenses may arise, management
currently believes that the revenue to be generated from operations together with equity and debt financing, including funding from USMC
in the form of a line of credit up to , will provide the necessary funding for the Company to continue as a going concern for
the next twelve months. 

On
February 8, 2024, the Company issued a two-year unsecured convertible note to USMC for the payment of the plaintiff s
attorney fees for the settlement of the Calvanico lawsuit (see Note 6). The note bears interest at per annum and any outstanding principal
and accrued interest are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of per share at the
sole discretion of the noteholder. As of the date hereof, there have been in advances from USMC under the note. 

On
March 7, 2024, the Company entered into a 
line of credit agreement with USMC, pursuant to a grid note issued in connection with the line of credit. The note bears interest at 
per annum and any outstanding principal and accrued interest are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at the
sole discretion of the noteholder at a conversion price of 
per share at maturity. As of the date hereof, there have been 
in advances from USMC under the line of credit. Currently, there are no other arrangements or agreements for financing with USMC and
management cannot guarantee any other potential debt or equity financing will be available, or if available, on favorable terms. As
such, these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve
months from the issuance date of this report. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, the Company will
need to curtail operations, or cease its operations completely. 

Practical
Expedients 

As
part of ASC Topic 606, the Company has adopted practical expedients including: 

Significant
 Financing Component the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing
 component since the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or
 service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. 

Unsatisfied
 and Partially Unsatisfied Performance Obligations for all performance obligations related to contracts with a duration for
 less than one year, the Company has elected to apply the optional exemption provided in ASC Topic 606 and therefore is not required
 to disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied
 at the end of the reporting period. 

Shipping
 and Handling Activities the Company elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather
 than as a separate performance obligation. 

Right
 to Invoice the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value
 provided to the customer of the Company s performance completed to date. The Company may recognize revenue in the amount to
 which the entity has a right to invoice.

 impact of any industry regulation; 

our
 ability to develop existing mining projects or establish proven or probable reserves; 

our
 dependence on one vendor for our minerals for our products; 

the
 impact of potentially losing the rights to properties; and 

the
 impact of the increase in the price of natural resources. 

29 

We
undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of
this Quarterly Report, except as required by law. 

As
used in this Quarterly Report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms Company, we, us, and
 our, refer to PureBase Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, PureBase Agricultural, Inc., a Nevada corporation PureBase AG and U.S. Agricultural Minerals, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company PureBase AM ). 

Business
Overview 

We
are an industrial mineral and natural resource company that provides solutions to the agriculture and construction materials markets
in the United States, through our two subsidiaries, PureBase AG, and PureBase AM, respectively. The Company relies on US Mine LLC for
its raw materials. A. Scott Dockter, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John Bremer, a director, are also
owners of US Mine, LLC. 

We
utilize the services of US Mine Corporation USMC ), a Nevada corporation and a significant stockholder of the Company for
the development and contract mining of industrial mineral and metal projects, exploration, drilling, preparation of feasibility studies,
mine modeling, on-site construction, production site reclamation and for product fulfillment. Exploration services include securing necessary
permits, environmental compliance, and reclamation plans. In addition, all of the minerals used by the Company are obtained from properties
owned or controlled by US Mine LLC. 

A.
Scott Dockter, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John Bremer, a director, are also officers, directors
and owners of USMC. A. Scott Dockter and John Bremer are also managers and owners of US Mine LLC. 

We
obtain certain raw clay materials from USMC through a material extraction agreement with US Mine LLC. US Mine LLC owns the mining property
which USMC leases. USMS pays US Mine LLC a royalty for which the Company reimburses USMC. 

Agricultural
Sector 

We
develop specialized sun protectants. We have developed and will seek to develop additional products derived from mineralized materials
of kaolin clay. 

Construction
Sector 

We
have been developing and testing a kaolin-based product that we believe will help create a lower CO2-emitting concrete through the use
of high-quality supplementary cementitious materials SCMs ). We are developing an SCM that we believe can potentially replace
up to 40 of cement, the most polluting part of concrete. As government agencies continue to enact stricter requirements for less-polluting
forms of concrete, we believe there are significant opportunities for high-quality SCM products in the construction-materials sector.

Revenues 

Revenue
decreased by 2,929, or 1 , for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. This decrease
was due to a decrease in customer purchases of agricultural products in the three months ended August 31, 2024. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold increased by 3,098, or 7 , for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended August 31,
2023, as a result of an increase in production supplies during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 

Operating
Expenses 

Total
operating expenses increased by 96,670, or 33 , for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended August
31, 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in selling and general and administrative expenses of 117,892
for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in wages
and related expenses and repairs to the pilot plant. 

31 

Interest
Expense, Related Parties 

Interest
expense decreased by 1,298 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023, primarily
due to conversion of notes payable to USMC to common stock in January 2024.

Revenues 

Revenue
decreased by 15,839, or 5 , for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023. This decrease
was due to no sales of agricultural products in the three months ended February 29, 2024, partially offset by greater sales of agricultural
products in the three months ended May 31, 2024. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold decreased by 12,896, or 14 , for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended August 31,
2023, as a result of a decrease in products sold during the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 

Operating
Expenses 

Total
operating expenses decreased by 7,255,241, or 85 , for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended August
31, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation of 7,311,827 for the nine months
ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023, partially offset by an increase of 79,999 in selling and
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023, primarily
due to an increase in wages and related expenses, an increase in pilot plant repairs and an increase in business insurance, offset by
a decrease in professional services. 

As
of April 2023, the Company no longer expensed the option to purchase an aggregate of 116,000,000 shares of common stock issued to US
Mine LLC on October 6, 2021, which resulted in the decreased stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended August 31,
2024 compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023. 

Other
Income 

Other
income decreased by 310,401, or 100 , for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023.
 275,000 other income in the nine months ended August 31, 2023 was for the settlement of a lawsuit for less than had been reserved. 35,401
other income in the nine months ended August 31, 2023 was for the forgiveness of a note principal and related accrued interest. 

32 

Interest
Expense, Related Parties 

Interest
expense increased by 25,143, or 54 , for the nine months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2023,
primarily due to increased borrowing from USMC. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of August 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of 31,246 and a working capital deficiency of 768,464, as compared to cash on hand of 5,572
and a working capital deficiency of 1,493,349 as of November 30, 2023. The decrease in working capital deficiency is primarily a result
of an increase in cash of 25,674, an increase in accounts receivable of 74,244, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses
of 286,977, a decrease in interest expense related parties of 60,908, and a decrease in settlement liability of 618,000 (financed
by a long-term convertible note payable), offset by 373,400 increase in the line of credit with USMC. 

The
Company s operating activities consume the majority of its cash resources. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur
operating losses as it executes its development plans for 2024, as well as other potential strategic and business development initiatives.
In addition, the Company has had and expects to have negative cash flows from operations, at least into the near future. The Company
has previously funded and currently plans to continue funding these losses from lines of credit with USMC and the sale of equity and
debt. 

Although
no assurances can be given as to the Company s ability to deliver on its revenue plans or that unforeseen expenses may arise, management
currently believes that the revenue to be generated from operations together with equity and debt financing, including the funding from
USMC in connection with the March 7, 2024 line of credit will provide the necessary funding for the Company to continue as a going concern
for the next twelve months. 

Going
Concern 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated losses from inception through August 31, 2024 of 63,839,678, negative
cash flows from operating activities of 1,957,010 for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and a working capital deficiency of 768,464
as of August 31, 2024. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, the Company received net cash proceeds of 1,991,400 from USMC.
If the Company does not generate additional revenue and obtain equity and debt financing from USMC or other third parties, it will not
have sufficient cash to meet its obligations for the next twelve months, following the date of this Quarterly Report. There currently
are no other arrangements or agreements for financing, and there can be no assurances that any other potential debt or equity financing
will be available, or if available, on favorable terms. As such, these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report. The condensed consolidated financial
statements in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.

The
increase in current assets as of August 31, 2024, is primarily due to the increase in cash of 25,674 and accounts receivable of 74,244.
The decrease in current liabilities is primarily a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 286,977, a decrease
in interest payable related party of 60,908, and a decrease settlement liability of 618,000, offset partially by an increase in borrowing
under the line of credit of 373,400.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls
and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon
that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of August 31, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting
described below. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by Sarbanes-Oxley is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
Company has determined that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective due to the following material weaknesses: 

Inadequate
 segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; 

Insufficient
 formal policies and procedures; and 

Lack
 of risk assessment procedures on internal controls to detect financial reporting risks on a timely manner. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness 

Management
has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses
are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: 

Continue
 to establish appropriate segregation of duties to achieve internal control objectives; and 

Continue
 to develop policies and procedures on internal control over financial reporting and monitor the effectiveness of operations on existing
 controls and procedures. 

We
engaged a third-party financial operations consulting firm to assist with the preparation of SEC reporting through the period ended August
31, 2023. 

Management
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing
basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that have
materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
