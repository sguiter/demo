As a result of this change, we reassessed our reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill. Prior to this change, consistent with the determination that we had operating/reportable segment, we determined that we had reporting units for goodwill assessment purposes. Our reassessment during the first quarter of 2024 determined that, consistent with the determination that we had operating/ reportable segments, we also have reporting units for goodwill assessment purposes: Retail Media and Performance Media.

 The million in financial and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were mainly driven by financial income from cash equivalents, partially offset by a negative impact of foreign exchange losses and the change in the accretion of the earn-out liability related to the Iponweb Acquisition. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our exposure to foreign currency risk was centralized at Criteo S.A. and hedged using foreign currency swaps or forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for income taxes differs from the nominal standard French rate of 25.0 primarily due to the application the reduced income tax rate on the majority of the technology royalties income in France and nondeductible equity awards compensation expense.

 Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
 We calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share by dividing the net income or loss attributable to shareholders of the Parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares not yet issued from share-based compensation plans (refer to Note 10). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a net loss hence basic net loss per share was the same as diluted net loss per share, as the inclusion of all potential shares of common stock outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. 
 For each period presented, a contract to issue a certain number of shares (i.e., share option, non-employee warrant, employee warrant ("BSPCE") was assessed as potentially dilutive if it was in the money (i.e., the exercise or settlement price is lower than the average market price).

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), on February 23, 2024. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 
 
 To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we present Contribution ex-TAC, and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We define Contribution ex-TAC as a profitability measure akin to gross profit. It is calculated by deducting traffic acquisition costs from revenue and reconciled to gross profit through the exclusion of other costs of revenue. Contribution ex-TAC is presented in the section entitled "Contribution excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs", which includes a reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, Gross Profit. We define Adjusted EBITDA as our consolidated earnings before financial income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, certain acquisition costs and a loss contingency related to a regulatory matter. Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the section entitled "Adjusted EBITDA", which includes a reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, Net Income. We also present revenues, traffic acquisition costs and Contribution ex-TAC on a constant currency basis; these measures exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and are computed by applying the average exchange rates for the prior year to the current year figures. A reconciliation is provided in the section entitled "Constant Currency Reconciliation". 
 
 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. As required by the rules of the SEC, we provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this document to the most directly comparable measures under GAAP. 
 Overview 
 We are a global technology company driving superior commerce outcomes for marketers and media owners through the world s leading Commerce Media Platform. We operate in commerce media, the future of digital advertising, leveraging commerce data and artificial intelligence ("AI") to connect ecommerce, digital marketing and media monetization to reach consumers throughout their shopping journey. Our vision is to bring richer experiences to every consumer by supporting a fair and open internet that enables discovery, innovation, and choice powered by trusted and impactful advertising. We have accelerated and deeply transformed the Company from a single-product to a multi-solution platform provider, fast diversifying our business into new solutions.. 
 
 We report our segment results as Retail and Performance Media: 
 
 Retail Media encompasses revenue generated from brands, agencies and retailers for the purchase and sale of retail media digital advertising inventory and audiences, and services. 
 
 Performance Media segment encompasses commerce activation, monetization, and services.

Current quarter financial highlights 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue decreased by (2) to 458.9 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by lower Performance Media, partially offset by growth in Retail Media. At constant currency, revenue decreased by (2) . 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 13 to 231.9 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly due to lower traffic acquisition costs, partially offset by lower revenue. 
 Contribution ex-TAC for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 8 to 266.1 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by growth across both segments. At constant currency, Contribution ex-TAC increased by 9 . 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 6.1 million, primarily due an increase of operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 20 to 82.0 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher Contribution ex-TAC, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. 
 
 Cash flow from operating activities was 57.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19.6 million in the same period in the prior year, as a result of the positive trends in our income from operations. 
 Trends, Opportunities and Challenges 
 We believe our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities but also pose risks and challenges, including those referred to in Part I, Item 1A of our risk factor section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Develop and Scale our Commerce Media Platform 
 
 Our future growth depends upon our ability to retain and scale our existing clients and increase the usage of our Commerce Media platform as well as adding new customers. We believe that we are in a leading position in the Commerce Media space as we have unique commerce data at scale, deep integrations with retailers, a large client base, differentiated technology and a R D powerhouse. By unifying the Commerce Media ecosystem with a multi-retailer, multi-channel, multi-format approach and providing full funnel closed loop measurement to our clients, we believe we are well positioned to capture more ad budgets and market share. 
 
 Business and Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 Global economic and geopolitical conditions have been volatile due to factors such as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, inflation, and fluctuating interest rates. The economic uncertainty resulting from these factors may negatively impact advertising demand, consumer behavior, and to some extent, our performance. 
 
 These factors, among others, including the impact of persistent inflation, make it difficult for Criteo and our clients to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause the company's clients to reduce or delay their advertising spending or increase their cautiousness, which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are monitoring these macroeconomic conditions closely and may continue to take actions in response to such conditions to the extent they adversely affect our business. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 In the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue, as many marketers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased back-to-school and holiday purchasing. Historically, the fourth quarter has reflected our highest level of advertising activity for the year. We generally expect the subsequent first quarter to reflect lower activity levels. 
 
 In addition, historical seasonality may not be predictive of future results given the potential for changes in advertising buying patterns and consumer activity due to the potential impacts of the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions discussed above. 
 29 

We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole. 
 
 Privacy Trends and Government Regulations 
 
 We are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, digital advertising and the collection of user data. In addition, large Internet and technology companies such as Google and Apple are making their own decisions as to how to protect consumer privacy with measures resulting in signal loss, which impact the entire digital ecosystem. While Google has recently announced that it will not pursue its original plan to fully phase out third-party cookies in Chrome, Google has proposed an updated approach that allows users to make an informed choice across web browsing that can be adjusted at any time. This proposal remains subject to consultation with the UK Competition and Market Authority, the Information Commissioner's Office and other global regulators. These developments could cause instability in the advertising technology industry. We have developed a multi-pronged addressability strategy to provide scalability and runtime interoperability of privacy-safe solutions for a more open, unified and efficient ecosystem.

 The decrease in other cost of revenue included a decrease in depreciation of servers, offset by other hosting costs. 
 
 Contribution excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs 
 
 We define Contribution excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs, "Contribution ex-TAC", as a profitability measure akin to gross profit. It is calculated by deducting traffic acquisition costs from revenue and reconciled to gross profit through the exclusion of other costs of revenue. Contribution ex-TAC is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have included Contribution ex-TAC because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions. In particular, we believe that this measure can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Contribution ex-TAC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of Contribution ex-TAC has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; (b) other companies may report Contribution ex-TAC or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Contribution ex-TAC alongside our other GAAP financial measures. 
 The below table provides a reconciliation of Contribution ex-TAC to gross profit: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands)

 We consider Contribution ex-TAC as a key measure of our business activity. Our strategy focuses on maximizing our Contribution ex-TAC on an absolute basis over maximizing our near-term gross margin. We believe this focus builds sustainable long-term value for our business by fortifying a number of our competitive strengths, including access to advertising inventory, breadth and depth of data and continuous improvement of our Criteo AI Engine s performance, allowing it to deliver more relevant advertisements at scale. As part of this focus, we continue to invest in building preferred relationships with direct publishers and pursue access to leading advertising exchanges.

Research and Development Expenses Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change (in thousands, except percentages) Research and development expenses 85,285 62,522 36 211,782 193,887 9 of revenue 19 13 15 14 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 22.8 million or 36 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was related to an increase in share-based compensation expense related to the Iponweb lock-up shares (see Note 10), an increase in amortization, and impairment of certain intangible assets. 
 Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 17.9 million or 9 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly related to an increase in amortization, impairment of certain intangible assets, and headcount-related costs. 
 
 Sales and Operations Expenses 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change (in thousands, except percentages) Sales and operations expenses 90,823 94,572 (4) 278,734 308,325 (10) of revenue 20 20 20 22 
 Sales and operations expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased (3.7) million or (4) compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly related to a decrease in headcount-related costs and a decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by third-party services and marketing costs. 
 Sales and operations expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased (29.6) million or (10) compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly related to a decrease in headcount-related costs, a decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by an increase in marketing costs. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative expenses 46,222 36,599 26 134,590 95,306 41 of revenue 10 8 10 7 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 9.6 million or 26 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily related to third party services and an increase in share-based compensation. 
 37 

General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 39.3 million or 41 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly related to the partial reversal of the loss contingency on regulatory matters in 2023 and an increase to third-party services. 
 
 Financial and Other Income 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change (in thousands, except percentages) Financial and Other Income (Expense) 
 (8) (2,967) (100) 889 2,008 (56) of revenue 0 (1) 0 0 
 Financial and Other Expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 3.0 million or 100 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly related to financial income from cash and cash equivalents, a positive change in foreign exchange loss, and the accretion of the earn-out liability related to the Iponweb Acquisition. 
 Financial and Other Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by (1.1) million or (56) compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to the disposal of non consolidated investments during the three months ended March 31, 2023, partially offset by income from cash equivalents, the accretion of the earn-out liability related to the Iponweb Acquisition, and income from cash equivalents. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our exposure to foreign currency risk was centralized at Criteo S.A. and hedged using foreign currency swaps or forward purchases or sales of foreign currencies. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income tax (expense) benefit (3,450) (1,832) 88 (15,014) 1,685 (991) 
 
 Provision for income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 1.6 million or 88 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of the income tax provision was driven by higher Contribution ex-Tac. 
 Provision for income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 16.7 million or (991) compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by higher Contribution ex-TAC. 
 The provision for income taxes differs from the nominal standard French rate of 25.0 primarily due to the application of the reduced income tax rate on the majority of the technology royalties income in France and nondeductible equity awards compensation expense.

Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as our consolidated earnings before financial income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, and certain acquisition costs. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the elimination of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, and certain acquisition costs in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our GAAP financial results, including net income. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Net Income (loss) 6,144 6,635 42,769 (7,407) Adjustments: Financial (Income) expense 8 2,958 (889) (1,692) Provision for income taxes (benefit) 3,450 1,832 15,014 (1,685) Equity awards compensation expense 34,863 24,323 84,032 78,219 Pension service costs 174 179 518 532 Depreciation and amortization expense 25,684 24,648 75,679 76,574 Acquisition-related costs 1,961 86 1,961 1,281 Net loss contingency on regulatory matters (51) (21,667) Restructuring, integration and transformation costs 9,717 7,833 27,026 38,998 Total net adjustments 75,857 61,808 203,341 170,560 Adjusted EBITDA 
 82,001 68,443 246,110 163,153 
 The following table presents our Adjusted EBITDA on a comparative basis: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 change (in thousands, except percentages) Adjusted EBITDA 82,001 68,443 20 246,110 163,153 51 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.6 million, or 20 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher Contribution ex-TAC partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased 83.0 million, or 51 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher Contribution ex-TAC.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at September 30, 2024 were held for working capital and general corporate purposes, which could include acquisitions, and amounted to 284.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The (127.4) million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash compared to December 31, 2023, primarily resulted from a decrease of (154.4) million in cash used for financing activities, a decrease of (59.0) million in cash used for investing activities partially offset by an increase of 88.7 million in cash provided by operating activities over the period. Our policy is to invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide liquidity. Accordingly, our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in demand deposit accounts that are currently providing only a minimal return. 
 As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, on September 27, 2022, the Company entered into a new five year Revolving Credit Facility (as amended, the "RCF") that allows immediate access to an additional 407.0 million 455.7 million) of liquidity, which, combined with our cash position, marketable securities and treasury shares as of September 30, 2024, provides total liquidity above 710.8 million. Overall, we believe that our current financial liquidity, combined with our expected cash-flow generation in 2024, enables financial flexibility. 
 Share buy-back programs 
 In December 2021, we completed a 100.0 million share repurchase program. In 2022, we completed an additional 136.0 million share repurchase program, and in 2023, we completed an additional 125.0 million share repurchase program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have repurchased 157.5 million of shares. 
 All above programs have been implemented under our multi-year authorization granted by our Board of Directors. On February 1, 2024, this authorization was extended to a total amount of 630.0 million. Other than these repurchase programs, we intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund our growth. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. We therefore believe that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships. 
 Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our capital expenditures were (53.2) million and (94.6) million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these capital expenditures were mainly comprised of acquisitions of data centers, server equipment, and software development costs. We expect our capital expenditures to remain at around 7 of Contribution ex-TAC for 2024, as we plan to continue to build, reshape and maintain additional data center equipment capacity in all regions and we increase our investments to further develop our Commerce Media Platform. 
 We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements. 
 Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in personnel and capital equipment, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new products and product enhancements. 
 40 

If our cash and cash equivalents balances and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings to support our operations, and such financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 We may also need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets or products. 
 If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing will be dilutive to our shareholders. 
 Historical Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth our cash flows for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Cash (used for) from operating activities 88,707 62,906 Cash (used for) from investing activities (58,966) (104,199) Cash (used for) from financing activities (154,355) (124,858) 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash from operating activities was driven by the increased performance of our operations, primarily due to higher Contribution ex-TAC partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Cash flow from operating activities has typically been generated from changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, adjusted for certain non-cash and non-operating items such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation, deferred tax assets and income taxes. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash and non-operating items, such as amortization and provision expense of 67.1 million, and equity awards compensation expense of 82.2 million, partially offset by (90.1) million of changes in working capital. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was mainly due to higher net income. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities to date consisted primarily of purchases of servers and other data-center equipment, software development costs, and business acquisitions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used for investing activities was (59.0) million, primarily driven by purchases of data-center and capitalized software development costs of (53.2) million, and a (5.2) million change from the maturity of investments in Marketable Securities. 
 Cash used for investing activities decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due to lower capital expenditures for our data centers compared to the previous period, and due to proceeds from the sale of a non consolidated investment during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used for financing activities was (154.4) million, due to the repurchasing of shares of (157.5) million. The increase in cash used for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was mostly due to an increase in the amount of shares repurchased.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (ii) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Criteo have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 For a discussion of our legal proceedings, refer to Note 14. Commitments and contingencies. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 You should carefully consider the risks described under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any such risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and the trading price of our American Depositary Shares could decline. These risks are not exclusive and additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.
