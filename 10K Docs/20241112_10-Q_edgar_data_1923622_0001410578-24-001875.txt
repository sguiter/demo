 Distributions To the extent that the Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make monthly distributions to its shareholders. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the record date. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on Company earnings, financial condition, maintenance of tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time. Capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain all or some of those capital gains for investment and pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on those retained amounts. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally will increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to shareholders. The Board authorizes and declares monthly distribution amounts per share of Class I, Class S and Class D Common Shares.

 Net realized gains Distributions in excess of net investment income Share Repurchase Program The Company provides liquidity through a quarterly repurchase program pursuant to which it will offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to of its Common Shares outstanding (either by number of Shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of the Company s shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Section 23 (c) of the 1940 Act. All Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Shares. Any repurchases of the Manager s and affiliate shares will be on the same terms and subject to the same limitations as other shareholders. Under the Company s share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase Shares in any particular quarter, the Company expects to repurchase Shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers (such date of the offer, the Repurchase Date using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective Repurchase Date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, share repurchases were completed by the Company.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events, the Company s future performance or financial condition and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview and Investment Framework The Company is a recently organized, externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company with limited operating history that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act effective May 5, 2023. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on March 21, 2022, we are externally managed by the Manager. The Manager has delegated to the Subadviser responsibility for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring the Company s portfolio on an ongoing basis. The Company also elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. The Company s investment objective is to seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Company seeks to meet its investment objective by investing primarily in privately placed floating rate leveraged (below investment grade) debt, including, but not limited to, senior secured, first lien, debt issuances in middle market companies primarily in the United States, as well as up to 30 of its total assets in investments in other countries (primarily Canada, Europe, Australia and Latin America) by utilizing the experience and expertise that PPC has in managing a portfolio of direct lending investments, since 2000. Emphasis will be placed on companies with value-added businesses in narrowly defined and defensive market sectors, and with the exception of collateral-backed transactions, companies capable of healthy free cash flow generation. PPC also looks for strong management teams with demonstrated track records and significant personal economic stakes in their companies success. Utilizing this strategy, the Company intends to structure its investments seeking meaningful contractual debt repayment and risk reduction features, typically first- priority senior secured ranking in the capital structure, and maintenance covenant(s) and terms protections. The Company will have a limited basket for second lien loans focused on transactions with true collateral coverage, expected to be no more than 20 of total invested capital in senior secured second and third lien loans, and unsecured loans. To manage its liquidity needs, from time to time the Company also intends to invest a portion of its assets in liquid assets, including cash and cash equivalents, liquid fixed-income securities and other credit instruments. PGIM Fixed Income will provide investment management services to the portion of the Company s investments allocated to broadly syndicated loans. Key Components of Our Results of Operations Investments Under normal circumstances, the Company intends to invest at least 80 of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit investments. The Company considers private credit investment to include loans, bonds and other credit instruments that are issued in private offerings or issued by private companies. Under normal circumstances, it is expected that the Company will primarily be invested in privately originated and privately negotiated direct lending investments to U.S. middle market companies through (i) first lien senior secured loans (including club deals by a small group of investment firms), and (ii) with not more than 20 of total invested capital in senior secured second and third lien loans, and unsecured loans. The Company primarily seeks investments in middle market companies predominantly located in the United States, as well as up to 30 of its total assets in investments in other countries (primarily Canada, Europe, Australia, and Latin America).

 Revenues The Company generates revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. The senior debt investments bear interest at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, the Company may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. The Company will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. Expenses Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Manager and the Subadviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services and subadvisory services to the Company and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Manager or Subadviser, as applicable. In connection with its management of the corporate affairs of the Company, the Manager bears the following expenses, among others: (i) the salaries and expenses of all employees of the Company and the Manager, except the fees and expenses of Trustees who are not affiliated persons of the Manager or any subadviser within the meaning of the 1940 Act; (ii) all expenses incurred by the Manager in connection with managing the ordinary course of the Company s business, other than those assumed by the Company in the Management Agreement; (iii) rent or depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items of the Manager or its affiliates; and (iv) the fees, costs and expenses payable to a subadviser pursuant to a subadvisory agreement. From time to time, the Manager or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. The Company will reimburse the Manager or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on the Company s behalf. From time to time, the Manager may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by the Company shareholders, subject to the expense cap noted below. Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement The Company has entered into an expense limitation and reimbursement agreement with the Manager (the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement ). For additional information see Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements Note 3. Management Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates. Portfolio and Investment Activity For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we acquired 53.0 million and 10.7 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of investments (including 8.9 million and 1.3 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments), all of which was first lien debt. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we acquired 85.4 million and 93.0 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of investments (including 13.0 million and 7.4 million, respectively, of unfunded commitments), all of which was first lien debt.

 Investment Income For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment income was 5.0 million and 12.5 million, respectively, all of which was attributable to interest and fees on our debt investments, dividend income and fee income. The increase in investment income from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase of 53.0 million and 85.4 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of new investments acquired during the period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, investment income was 3.1 million and 6.3 million, respectively, all of which was attributable to interest and fees on our debt investments and dividend income.

The increase in total expenses from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to an increase in professional fees, interest expenses, management and incentive fees due to an increased cost of servicing a larger investment portfolio. Total expenses before expense reimbursement and incentive fee waiver for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 1.5 million and 2.2 million, consisting primarily of income based incentive fees, custodian and accounting fees, trustees fees, pricing fees, professional fees, transfer agent s fees and expenses, shareholder s reports and other general and administrative fees.

To qualify for and maintain qualification as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, the Company must distribute to its shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of the sum of (i) its investment company taxable income for that year (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long- term capital losses and (ii) its net tax-exempt income. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its shareholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company would represent obligations of the Company s shareholders and would not be reflected in the financial statements of the Company.

 In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any excise tax expense. Net realized gain (loss) and Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported realized gains from foreign currency transactions of 3 thousand and 8 thousand, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the foreign currency. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported realized gains (losses) from forward foreign currency contracts of 16 thousand and (55) thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported realized gains from non-affiliated investments transactions of 8 thousand and 16 thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported realized gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions of (1) thousand and 6 thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a realized gains from forward currency contracts of 58 thousand and 50 thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported no realized gains from non-affiliated investments transactions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized appreciation from foreign currency of 29 thousand and 29, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized depreciation from forward foreign currency contracts of (979) thousand and (481) thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized appreciation from non-affiliated investments transactions of 896 thousand and 811 thousand, respectively, which reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio relative to its cost basis over the period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported unrealized depreciation from foreign currency of (1) thousand and (1), respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported unrealized appreciation from forward foreign currency contracts of 15 thousand and 24 thousand, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported unrealized appreciation from non-affiliated investments transactions of 53 thousand and 166 thousand, respectively, which reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio relative to its cost basis over the period. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily through the net proceeds of the offering of the Common Shares, any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future, and cash flows from operations, including investments sales and repayments and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. The primary uses of cash have been investments in portfolio companies and other general corporate purposes. The primary uses of cash are expected to be for investments in portfolio companies and other investments, distributions to shareholders, for operational costs such as paying management and incentive fees, custodian and accounting fees and for the cost of any borrowings or financing arrangements. We believe that cash flows from operations and existing cash on hand, together with net proceeds of the offering of the Common Shares, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and foreseeable future.

 The Company is permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to Common Shares if asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least equal 150 immediately after each such issuance. On November 8, 2022, the Company s sole shareholder approved the adoption of this 150 threshold pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and such election became effective the following day. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, the Company will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless the Company meets the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. The Company also may be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of the total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an aggregate amount of 51.5 million and 0 of debt securities outstanding and the asset coverage ratio was 271.3 and 0 , respectively. Pursuant to the Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement, for three years from May 5, 2023, the effective date of the Company s registration statement (the ELRA Period ), the Manager has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or reimburse expenses of the Company so that the Company s Specified Expenses (as defined below) will not exceed 0.50 of net assets (annualized). The Company has agreed to repay these amounts, when and if requested by the Manager, but only if and to the extent that Specified Expenses are less than 0.50 of net assets (annualized) (or, if a lower expense limit is then in effect, such lower limit) within three years after the date the Manager waived or reimbursed such fees or expenses. This arrangement cannot be terminated without the consent of the Board prior to the end of the ELRA Period. Specified Expenses includes all expenses incurred in the business of the Company, including organizational and offering costs (excluding the organizational and offering expenses relating to the initial sale of Class I, Class S and Class D Common Shares), with the following exceptions: (i) the management fee, (ii) the incentive fee, (iii) the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee, (iv) brokerage costs or other investment-related out-of-pocket expenses, (v) dividend/ interest payments (including any dividend payments, interest expenses, commitment fees, or other expenses related to any leverage incurred by the Company), (vi) taxes, and (vii) extraordinary expenses (as determined in the sole discretion of the Manager). Prior to the Company s election of BDC status, the Manager agreed to voluntarily enact the above-described expense limitation. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 12.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, including foreign currency. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 61.3 million, primarily as a result of purchasing portfolio investments of 78.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from repayment of investments of 7.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 57.3 million, primarily as a result of dividends paid in cash and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had 30.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, including foreign currency. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 70.1 million, primarily as a result of purchasing portfolio investments of 76.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from repayment of investments of 1.7 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 97.4 million, primarily as a result of proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below will be reinvested into additional Common Shares. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Common Shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional Common Shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. The following tables reflect the Common Shares issued pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of the Company s shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Section 23 (c) of the 1940 Act. All Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Shares. Any repurchases of the Manager s and affiliate shares will be on the same terms and subject to the same limitations as other shareholders.

Table of Contents 
 Under the Company s share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase Common Shares in any particular quarter, the Company expects to repurchase Shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers on or around the last business day of that quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be subject to the Early Repurchase Deduction. The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective Repurchase Date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no Common Share repurchases were completed by the Company. Borrowings On October 30, 2023, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets in the Company s portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. The stated interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is determined pursuant to a formula-based calculation based on the gross borrowing base at the time, resulting in a stated interest rate, depending on the type of borrowing, of either (a) Term SOFR plus a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment and an applicable margin equal to 2.125 per annum or 2.25 per annum, or (b) Alternate Base Rate plus a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment and an applicable margin equal to 1.125 per annum or 1.25 per annum in respect of USD borrowings and comparable rates in respect of non-USD borrowings. The initial principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is 150 million. The Revolving Credit Facility has an accordion feature, subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, which could bring total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to up to 350 million. All amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid by the date that is five years after the closing date of the Revolving Credit Facility. The following table presents outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands): 

September 30, 2024 Aggregate Principal Outstanding Carrying Unused Amount Committed Principal Value Portion (1) Available (2) Revolving Credit Facility 150,000 68,400 68,400 81,600 58,239 Total 150,000 68,400 68,400 81,600 58,239 

 (1) The unused portion is the amount upon which commitment fees, if any, are based. (2) The amount available reflects any limitations related to the credit facility s borrowing base. 
 For additional information on our debt obligations see Note 6. Borrowings to the financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not expect to have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. The Company considers the most significant accounting policies to be those related to Valuation of Portfolio Investments, are described below. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in, Item 1, as well as with Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 The Company values its investments in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. The Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a readily available market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 5. Fair Value Measurements . The Board has adopted valuation procedures for security valuation under which fair valuation responsibilities have been delegated to PGIM Investments as Valuation Designee. Pursuant to the Board s delegation, the Valuation Designee has established a valuation committee responsible for supervising the fair valuation of portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities. The valuation procedures permit the Company to utilize independent valuation advisor services. The Valuation Designee will use reliable market quotations to value the Company s investments when such market quotations are readily available. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available or whose market quotations are not deemed to represent fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Valuation Designee. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where the Valuation Designee reasonably believes that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser or the market for a particular security causes current market quotes not to reflect the fair value of the security. If and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Company typically utilizes independent third party valuation firms to assist in determining fair value. Accordingly, such investments go through a multi-step valuation process as described below. The Valuation Designee may engage one or more independent valuation firms based on a review of each firm s expertise and relevant experience in valuing certain securities. In each case, independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such Level 3 categorized assets. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Valuation Designee, subject to oversight by the Board, has approved a multi-step valuation process each month, as described below: Valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued at cost. For Level 3 investments, the cost (purchase price adjusted for accreted original issue discount/amortized premium) or any recent comparable trade activity on the security investment shall be considered to reasonably approximate the fair value of the investment, provided that no material change has since occurred in the issuer s business, significant inputs or the relevant environment. The Valuation Designee discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in the portfolio based in part on information from an independent valuation firm that is provided on a monthly basis in conjunction with the determination of the Net Asset Value NAV per share each month. Valuation conclusions are discussed with and documented by the Valuation Designee, including whether a significant observable change has occurred since the most recent month-end with respect to an investment that requires an adjustment from the most recent monthly valuation. The Board reviews valuations approved by the Valuation Designee at least quarterly. 
 As part of the Company s valuation process, the Valuation Designee will take into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of the Company s investments without market quotations, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, (v) a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and (vi) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. The determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a readily available market for these non-traded securities existed. Due to this uncertainty, fair value determinations may cause NAV on a given date to materially differ from the value that may ultimately realize upon the sale of one or more of the investments.

Table of Contents 
 The Board reviews the valuations of portfolio investments quarterly and, no less frequently than annually, the adequacy of policies and procedures regarding valuations and the effectiveness of their implementation. The Company s accounting policy on the fair value of investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining fair value measurements, the fair values of investments may differ from the amounts that we ultimately realize or collect from sales or maturities of investments, and the differences could be material. Recent Developments The Company s management evaluated recent developments through the date of issuance of the financial statements. There have been no recent developments that occurred during such period that would require disclosure in this report, except as discussed below. On October 25, 2024, the Company declared a distribution of 0.33638 per Class I Share, 0.31874 per Class S Share, and 0.33141 per Class D Share which is payable on November 26, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk The Company is subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. Valuation Risk The Company plans to invest primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures adopted by the Manager, as valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, and under the oversight of the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Manager, the Subadviser and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Valuation Designee to review the Company s investments. The Board will review and determine, or (subject to the Board s oversight) delegate to the Valuation Designee to determine, the fair value of each of the Company s investments and NAV per share each month. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. The company intends to fund portions of investments with borrowings, and at such time, net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which the Company invests and the rate at which the Company borrow. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on net investment income. If deemed prudent, the Company may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Company may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. The Company may also borrow funds in local currency as a way to hedge our non-U.S. denominated investments. In the event of a rising interest rate environment, payments under floating rate debt instruments generally would rise and there may be a significant number of issuers of such floating rate debt instruments that would be unable or unwilling to pay such increased interest costs and may otherwise be unable to repay their loans. Investments in floating rate debt instruments may also decline in value in response to rising interest rates if the interest rates of such investments do not rise as much, or as quickly, as market interest rates in general. Similarly, during periods of rising interest rates, fixed-rate debt instruments may decline in value because the fixed rates of interest paid thereunder may be below market interest rates.

 Based on Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in investment (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income Up 300 basis points 5,287 (2,052) 3,235 Up 200 basis points 3,524 (1,368) 2,156 Up 100 basis points 1,762 (684) 1,078 Down 100 basis points (1,762) 684 (1,078) Down 200 basis points (3,524) 1,368 (2,156) Currency Risk The Company expects to hedge most of the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on the non-U.S. cash receipts that would flow from non-U.S. investments, including by funding such investments with borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currency or through other hedging techniques (including the use of foreign currency forward contracts or swaps), subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. A foreign currency forward contract is an obligation to buy or sell a given currency on a future date and at a set price or to make or receive a cash payment based on the value of a given currency at a future date. Delivery of the underlying currency is expected, the terms are individually negotiated, the counterparty is not a clearing corporation or an exchange, and payment on the contract is made upon delivery, rather than daily. There is uncertainty regarding the timing and amounts of those future cash flows, and the Company s strategies for hedging transactions are subject to inherent imperfections. As such, the full risk of currency fluctuations will not be eliminated and the Company may be exposed to additional risk of loss. There can be no guarantee that instruments suitable for hedging in market shifts will be available at the time when the Company wishes to use them. Certain of the Company s hedging transactions may be undertaken through brokers, banks or other organizations, and the Company will be subject to risk of default or insolvency of such counterparties. In such event, there can be no assurance that any money advanced to or obligations from these counterparties would be repaid or that the Company would have any recourse in the event of default. Further, hedging transactions may reduce cash available to pay distributions to shareholders. Item 4. Control and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. From time to time, the Company may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under Item 1A in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Although the risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 represent the principal risks associated with an investment in us, they are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial may materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. As of September 30, 2024, the risk factors appearing in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 are supplemented and updated as follows: The following paragraph is added to the disclosure in Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investments Our investments in prospective portfolio companies may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment. Broadly Syndicated Loans Risk. The Company may invest in senior secured loans that include broadly syndicated loans where we do not act as lead arranger, joint lead arranger or co-manager. In addition, the broadly syndicated loans in which we will invest may not be protected by financial covenants or limitations upon additional indebtedness, may have limited liquidity and may not be rated by a credit rating agency. Under the documentation for such loans, a financial institution or other entity typically is designated as the administrative agent and/or collateral agent. This agent is granted a lien on any collateral on behalf of the other lenders and distributes payments on the indebtedness as they are received. The agent is the party responsible for administering and enforcing the loan and generally may take actions only in accordance with the instructions of a majority or two-thirds in commitments and/or principal amount of the associated indebtedness. Accordingly, we may be precluded from directing such actions unless we or our Subadviser is the designated administrative agent or collateral agent or we act together with other holders of the indebtedness. If we are unable to direct such actions, we cannot assure you that the actions taken will be in our best interests. There is a risk that a loan agent may become bankrupt or insolvent. Such an event would delay, and possibly impair, any enforcement actions undertaken by holders of the associated indebtedness, including attempts to realize upon the collateral securing the associated indebtedness and/or direct the agent to take actions against the related obligor or the collateral securing the associated indebtedness and actions to realize on proceeds of payments made by obligors that are in the possession or control of any other financial institution. In addition, we may be unable to remove the agent in circumstances in which removal would be in our best interests. Moreover, agented loans typically allow for the agent to resign with certain advance notice. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

In this Agreement, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Registration Statement means, at any given time, each of the registration statements listed on Schedule 1, as such Schedule 1 may be amended from time to time, as each such registration statement is finally amended and revised at the Effective Date of the registration statement (including at the Effective Date of any post-effective amendment thereto). Each Registration Statement shall register an ongoing offering (each, an Offering of the Company s common shares of beneficial interest, 0.01 par value per share Common Shares ), which may consist of Class S, Class D and/or Class I common shares of beneficial interest (the Shares ). In this Agreement, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Offering means each Offering covered by a Registration Statement and Shares means the Shares being offered in the Offering. The Offering is and shall be comprised of a maximum amount of Shares set forth in the Prospectus (as defined in Section 1.a. below) that will be issued and sold to the public at the public offering prices per Share set forth in the Prospectus pursuant to a primary offering (the Primary Shares ). The Company will also issue shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP Shares ). In connection with the Offering, the minimum purchase by any one person shall be as set forth in the Prospectus (except as otherwise indicated in any letter or memorandum from the Company to the Intermediary Manager).

The Company is offering to the public three classes of Shares: Class S shares, Class D shares, and Class I shares. The differences between the classes of Shares and the eligibility requirements for each class are described in detail in the Prospectus.

The terms of any reallowance of the Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fee shall be set forth in the Selected Intermediary Agreement, any agreement with a Selected RIA, Selected Institution Agreement, or Servicing Agreement entered into with the Offering Participants or Servicing Brokers, as applicable. The Company will not be liable or responsible to any Offering Participant or Servicing Broker for any reallowance of Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fee to such Offering Participant or Servicing Broker, as applicable, it being the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Intermediary Manager for payment of Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fee to Offering Participants and Servicing Brokers.

If such claims or actions are alleged or brought against more than one indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall only be obliged to reimburse the expenses and fees of the one law firm that has been selected by a majority of the indemnified parties against which such action is finally brought; and in the event a majority of such indemnified parties are unable to agree on which law firm for which expenses or fees will be reimbursable by the indemnifying party, then payment shall be made to the first law firm of record representing an indemnified party against the action or claim. Such law firm shall be paid only to the extent of services performed by such law firm and no reimbursement shall be payable to such law firm on account of legal services performed by another law firm. f.
