Lion Copper and Gold Corp. Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements

(December 31, 2023 - ), working capital deficit of (December 31, 2023 - and an accumulated deficit of (December 31, 2023 - ). 
 The Company has no source of revenue and has significant requirements to maintain its mineral property interests and meet its obligations as they come due. Although the Company has raised funds in the past through debt, equity and strategic investors, there is no assurance that such financing will be available. If adequate financing is not available or cannot be obtained on a timely basis, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of its exploration programs, or relinquish its rights under the existing option and acquisition agreements. The above factors represent material uncertainties that cast substantial doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 If the going concern assumptions were not appropriate for these Interim Financial Statements, adjustments would be necessary to the carrying values of assets, liabilities, the reported expenses, and the consolidated balance sheet classifications used. Such adjustments could be material. 

These Interim Financial Statements include the financial statements of Lion CG and its subsidiaries:

Falcon Copper Services LLC (Wyoming) by FCC 

Blue Copper LLC (Montana) - by FCC 

On October 4, 2021, Blue Copper LLC was incorporated in Montana, USA and acquired Blue Copper Prospect in Powell County and Lewis Clark County in Montana. 
 On April 5, 2022, Quaterra Alaska sold its two options to acquire the Butte Valley property to Falcon Butte Minerals Corp. ("Falcon Butte"), formerly 1301666 B.C. Ltd., for 500 cash and 16,049,444 shares in Falcon Butte represented 25.54 of shares outstanding (Note 5). 
 On December 13, 2022, Quaterra Alaska transferred its 100 interest in Blue Copper LLC, a 90 interest in the Groundhog property in Alaska, a 5 net profit interest associated with the Nieves silver property in Mexico, and Butte Valley royalty to Falcon Copper Corp., ("FCC") formerly, Blue Copper Resources Corp. in exchange for 57,513,764 common shares of FCC, represented 79.3 of the FCC's then-issued and outstanding shares (Note 6). 
 On August 25, 2023, Blue Copper Royalties LLC was incorporated in Wyoming and on September 6, 2023, FCC transferred the Butte Valley royalty and interest in Nieves to Blue Copper Royalties. 

and management assessed control still exists and thus continues to consolidate FCC. In the absence of majority holdings, the Company will continue to consolidate FCC as the Company has majority representation on the board of directors and management of FCC.

common shares of FCC which represented of all issued and outstanding shares at December 13, 2022. This transaction was considered a transaction between entities under common control, and thus was recorded at carrying value. 
 On March 2, 2023, FCC completed a private placement financing of by issuing units at a price of . Each unit consists of one common share, and one common share purchase warrant exercisable at for a period of year. 
 In addition, the private placement was considered a "triggering event" for Simple Agreements for Future Equity ("SAFE Notes"). FCC had previously raised in SAFE Notes and were converted into equity of FCC, resulting in FCC issuing an additional common shares. 
 On September 6, 2023, FCC carried out a re-organization of its assets and capital structure (the transaction described herein is referred to as the "Reorganization"). On August 25, 2023, a new entity, BCR LLC was organized in Wyoming. BCR LLC subsequently adopted an Operating Agreement that provided for issuance of LLC Interests to its Members in the same amounts as shares issued to Shareholders of FCC. On September 6, 2023, two of the mining assets, referred to as the Butte Valley Royalty and the Nieves Royalty, that had been held by FCC were assigned to BCR LLC in exchange for of the issued and outstanding LLC Interests of BCR LLC. The Nieves Royalty may only be transferred with the written consent of a third party which was received October 23, 2023 resulting in the Nieves property transferring immediately. The same LLC interests were immediately distributed pro rata to the shareholders of FCC. Furthermore, FCC had previously issued Warrants to purchase (total of common share purchase warrants) shares of Common Stock of FCC at a Warrant Price of per Share. As part of the Reorganization, these Warrants were exchanged by the Warrant Holders for two new Warrants; one issued by FCC to purchase Shares of FCC at a Warrant Price of per Share, and the other issued by BCR LLC to purchase LLC Units of BCR LLC at a Warrant Price of per LLC Unit. The exchange transaction was accounted for under ASC 815 whereby the effect of the exchange was measured as the excess of the fair value of the exchanged warrant over the fair value of the warrant immediately before it is exchanged. Using this method, the effect of the exchange was calculated to be . As a result of the Reorganization and the issuance and distribution of these LLC Interests, each shareholder of FCC holds the same percentage interest in FCC as the shareholders holds in BCR LLC. Additionally, the Warrant Holders now holds two Warrants, one issued by each of FCC and BCR LLC, with the aggregate value of the two warrants equal to the aggregate value of the Warrant that they held prior to the exchange. The net effect is that the capital structure of BCR LLC matches the capital structure of FCC, including the issuance of new Warrants, and the Butte Valley Royalty and Nieves Royalty are now held by BCR LLC rather than FCC. 
 On October 17, 2023, FCC issued common shares at a price of per common share for total proceeds of . 

From February to May 2024, FCC issued a total of common shares at per common share for gross proceeds of . 
 As a result, the Company's ownership in FCC is reduced to as of September 30, 2024, with the changes in NCI listed below:

, bearing an interest rate of per annum. These debentures replaced previously issued debentures that were due in February 2024. 
 These debentures are convertible into common shares of the Company at a price of per share, or at the holder's option, are converted in-kind for common shares of FCC at per FCC share. 

warrants are issued exercisable at till February 16, 2025. These warrants were determined to be liability classified as the warrants can be exercised in a currency other than its functional currency (Notes 7, 10). 
 Based on the terms of the newly issued debentures, the convertible debentures were determined to be a financial instrument comprising a host debt component, and the conversion feature and warrants denominated in Canadian dollars are classified as a derivative liability. In this case, as the conversion option on the instrument is bifurcated both before and after the modification or exchange, the Company used the 10 cash flow test. As a result, the change in cash flows was considered not substantial for the convertible debentures issued on June 17, 2022, and July 8, 2022, and extinguishment accounting was not applied. A new effective interest rate was determined and there was no gain or loss recorded on the condensed interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. However, the convertible debentures issued on March 2, 2023, surpassed the 10 cash flow test and as a result, the debentures were considered extinguished. A new effective interest was determined and there was a loss on extinguishment recorded on the condensed interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Under ASC 815, for the convertible debentures that did not meet the 10 cash flow test, the amended conversion feature and the replacement warrants were valued using the Black Scholes model and the difference between the fair value of the original conversion feature and amended conversion feature were reflected on the condensed interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a gain/loss on the revaluation of the derivative liabilities. The changes in fair value of the warrants associated with the prior debentures was recognized as a gain/loss and the fair value of the replacement warrants were deducted from the face value of the replacement debentures. For the convertible debentures that surpassed the 10 cash flow test, the fair value of the debentures at maturity were present valued using the new effective interest rate of and the conversion feature and replacement warrants were valued using the Black Scholes model. The difference between the present value of the new debentures, conversion feature, replacement warrants and the carrying value of the prior debentures, fair value of the original conversion feature and warrants were recorded on the condensed interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a loss on extinguishment of . 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company completed a private placement of and issued units and common shares to settle of debenture debt. The fair value of the shares and warrants is and , respectively. These warrants were determined to be liability classified as the warrants have an exercise price in a currency other than its functional currency (Notes 7, 10). 
 In conjunction with the Company s CSE listing on September 19, 2024, warrants were issued to certain directors and individual who converted their debts into common shares of the Company on March 8, 2024. These warrants were treated as a contingency with their fair value being recorded as a derivative liability on March 8, 2024. On September 19, 2024, these warrants were revalued at and recorded as equity since all are exercisable in USD, the functional currency of the Company. 
 Under ASC 815, the conversion of debt with a bifurcated conversion option is accounted for under the debt extinguishment accounting model. Therefore, both the debt and the conversion option that is accounted for as a derivative was derecognized at their carrying amounts and the consideration transferred were measured at its then-current fair value, with any difference recorded as a gain or loss on the extinguishment of the two separate liabilities. The existing debenture settlement resulted in a loss on conversion of . 
 Additionally, on March 8, 2024, the Company repaid convertible debentures of a total of in cash with a loss of .

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Dated: November 14, 2024 
 (In U.S. dollars) 

This Management's Discussion and Analysis (" MD A ") of Lion Copper and Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, " Lion CG " or the " Company "), dated November 14, 2024, should be read in conjunction with the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and related notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (" U.S. GAAP "). All dollar amounts in this MD A are United States dollars unless otherwise noted. 
 Additional information about Lion CG, including the Company's press releases, quarterly and annual reports is available through the Company's filings with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada at www.sedarplus.com or the United States Securities Exchange Commission (" SEC ") at www.sec.gov /edgar. Information about mineral resources, as well as risks associated with investing in the Company's securities is contained in the Company's most recently filed 10-K. 
 Steven Dischler, CEO of the Company, is a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (" NI 43-101 "), and has approved the scientific and technical information in this MD A. 
 ABOUT LION CG 
 Lion Copper and Gold Corp., formerly Quaterra Resources Inc., is a Canadian-based Company advancing its 100 owned flagship copper projects at Yerington, Nevada through an option to earn-in agreement with Nuton LLC, a Rio Tinto Venture. The Company also looks for opportunities to acquire projects on reasonable terms that have the potential to host large mineral deposits attractive to major mining companies. 
 The Company is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada on May 11, 1993. Its registered and records offices are located at 1200 - 750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T8. 
 On November 22, 2021, the Company changed its name and began trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (" TSXV ") under the new symbol "LEO" and on the OTCQB Market under the symbol "LCGMF". On September 19, 2024, the Company's common shares were voluntarily delisted on the TSXV and were subsequently listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange ("CSE") under the same symbol "LEO". 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company transitioned into the SEC reporting system because more than 50 of its outstanding voting common shares are held directly or indirectly by residents of the United States, and the majority of its directors are U.S. citizens. Consequently, the Company must adhere to the SEC's reporting and disclosure requirements. 
 On March 18, 2022, the Company entered an option to earn-in agreement (the Rio Agreement with Rio Tinto America Inc. Rio Tinto ), to advance studies and exploration at the Company s copper projects in Mason Valley, Nevada. The Agreement defines three stages of investment by Nuton. Following the completion of Stage 2, Rio Tinto has the exclusive option to earn an initial 65 interest in the projects comprising Yerington, MacArthur, Wassuk, Bear and associated water rights (the " Mining Assets ") by making staged investments in the Mining Assets at Yerington. 
 Rio Tinto is evaluating the potential commercial deployment of its Nuton technologies at the site. Nuton offers copper heap leaching technologies developed by Rio Tinto to deliver greater copper recovery from mined ore and access new sources of copper, such as low-grade sulfide resources and reprocessing of stockpiles and mineralized waste. These technologies have the potential to deliver leading environmental performance through more efficient water usage, lower carbon emission, and the ability to reclaim mine sites by reprocessing waste. 
 The Agreement was subsequently assigned to Nuton LLC, a Rio Tinto venture. The Rio Agreement was amended in October 2023 with Stage 2 being modified to Stage 2a and Stage 2b. The Company completed Stage 1 on December 22, 2022, Stage 2a on January 12, 2024, and is currently progressing in Stage 2b. 
 Should the Parties agree that Stage 2c is necessary, the Parties will memorialize the scope of work in a letter agreement. Subject to internal approvals, Nuton will advance another 5,000 of Stage 3 within 30 days of the execution of the Stage 2c Program of Work Agreement.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") 
 On January 30, 2024, the Company announced the results of a PEA on its Yerington Copper Project. The PEA envisions an open pit mining strategy followed by a heap leach operation, enhanced by the application of Rio Tinto's Nuton technologies to process primary sulfide copper materials. Highlights of the PEA results include: 
 Post-tax NPV7 of 356 million and IRR of 17.4 , calculated at a copper price of 3.85/lb. 
 12-year open pit mine life encompassing operations at Yerington and MacArthur, with projected lifetime copper (Cu) production of 1.4 billion pounds, averaging 117 million pounds per year 
 Initial capital expenditure of 413 million including all mine pre-production costs, with sustaining capital of 653 million 
 Post-tax payback period of 5.0 years 
 Average cash operating costs of 2.20/lb. copper payable 
 Cumulative cashflow of 1.00 billion post-tax and 1.24 billion pre-tax on base case assumptions 
 Rio Agreement 
 On March 12, 2024, the Company announced the commencement of the Stage 2b and Stage 3 Programs of Work to advance the flagship Yerington Copper Project through completion of a Pre-Feasibility Study (" PFS ") and progress permitting and exploration initiatives on the Bear Deposit. 
 PFS Work Programs 
 During the quarter ending September 30, 2024, PFS progressive work included resource updates, environmental and geotechnical studies, metallurgical testing and engineering. 
 Eighteen drill holes were completed at MacArthur. 
 Four core drill holes were drilled at Yerington. The recently completed drilling, together with the discovery of an additional 17 historic Anaconda holes that were not included in the January 2024 Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA"), are now being incorporated into an updated mineral resource as a key input into the PFS. One of the core holes has been converted into a water level measuring well. 
 Eighteen reverse circulation drill holes were completed at MacArthur and a well was installed in one of the holes. 
 The objective of the 2024 drilling programs at MacArthur and Yerington was to convert as much of the inferred resource to the indicated resource classification so that it can be included in the prefeasibility study ("PFS"). 
 The Vat Leached Tailings (" VLT ") resource model was re-evaluated by incorporating highwall and backhoe sampling that was completed in 2011 and 2012. A detailed statistical evaluation of this information has allowed for increased search distances, influencing the assigned mineral resource classes. The updated resource will be used in the PFS. 
 Yerington core drilling provided material for geomechanical testing, oriented core measurement and geotechnical logging to assess pit slope design. A pit slope stability evaluation, including geotechnical pit bench mapping was initiated during Q2. Additional drill core samples were selected and delivered for metallurgical column leach test work. Drill core samples were submitted for laboratory testing to characterize the geochemistry of the planned mined materials. Laboratory results have been received and are currently in review and an analysis will be provided in the PFS. 
 Nine geotechnical test pits were completed, and samples from the test pits have been submitted for laboratory testing. Geotechnical drilling at Yerington and MacArthur to support the PFS are in the planning stages. The timing and scope of additional drilling is dependent on receipt of permits from NDEP, as discussed in the next section. This geotechnical field and test work will progress the optimization and siting of project infrastructure for the PFS.

Metallurgical column leach testing is currently underway for MacArthur and Yerington material. Four columns representing the main MacArthur pit area and the North Ridge area started September 9, 2024. Five columns representing the oxide and transition portion of the Yerington pit started on September 30, 2024. Material from the Gallagher portion of the MacArthur deposit and the VLT have also been submitted to the laboratory for metallurgical testing. Column leach testing and hydrodynamic leach characterization of sulfides is also ongoing by Nuton . 
 Two rotosonic drill holes were completed for a combined footage of 358 feet. A third drill hole is in progress. These drill holes were completed north of MacArthur for evaluating a potential Rapid Infiltration Basin (RIB) location for Yerington pit dewatering. One additional drill hole was completed in Q3 and material from drilling will be submitted for column testing and geochemical evaluation. 
 Bear Drilling 
 The Bear deposit is a large and partially defined porphyry copper exploration target located primarily on private lands approximately three miles north of the Yerington pit. Two diamond core holes, B-055 and B-056A, were drilled to depths of 3,435 feet and 3,613 feet, respectively, to further define the target. Drilling was completed in Q2, and assays were also received in Q2. B-055 was drilled on the far western extent of the deposit and directed to intersect a +55 Induced Polarization (IP) anomaly. Weak copper mineralization was encountered within a 2,330-foot intercept of sulfide mineralization, starting at 1,105 feet. B-056A was drilled to test a wide spaced drilling gap along the district northwest mineralization trend. This drill hole identified 0.40 TCu over 2,376 feet from a depth of 1,237 feet, including 130 ft of 0.65 TCu and 138 Ft of 0.62 TCu. The final two intervals encountered 1.150 TCu and 0.904 TCu, respectively, below which the borehole was lost. Oriented core measurements from this hole confirmed the northwest trend with a 40-50 north to northeast dip. 
 Permitting and Environmental 
 During the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the following material permit related activities occurred: 
 On August 12, 2024, SPS received approval from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) for an amendment to Reclamation Permit Number 0294 to allow for geotechnical drilling and monitoring well installation within the MacArthur Exploration project area. 
 On August 22, 2024, SPS received a decision notice from the Bureau of Land Management BLM authorizing exploration work on public lands located north and east the MacArthur Exploration project area. The authorized work supports completion of the PFS. 
 On September 17, 2024, SPS received a decision notice from the BLM authorizing the same work approved by NDEP in the August 12 permit approval. The work authorized by both agencies supports completion of the PFS. 
 All permits either applied for or received during the period are aligned to the Stage 2B work plan requirements. For those permits that SPS has applied for but has not yet received, the Company continues to work cooperatively and proactively with NDEP to facilitate permit issuance in a timely manner. SPS expects to receive the remaining permits from NDEP in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 On July 15, 2024, SPS applied for a permit to appropriate water contained within the Yerington Pit Lake for storage purposes only. The permit application did not seek appropriate additional water for consumptive use. While the water storage permit is not a prerequisite for future dewatering of Yerington Pit Lake, it would have streamlined anticipated future administrative changes to other existing water rights. On August 5, 2024, SPS received correspondence from the State of Nevada that the application for water storage was denied based on similar applications for water storage that were also denied by the State in 2011 for an applicant other than SPS. SPS disputes this rationale as SPS provided information clearly showing how its application materially differed from those denied by the State in 2011. SPS filed a timely appeal of the denial with the District Court. 
 Water Rights 
 On July 23, 2021, the Company received notice from the State of Nevada that three water rights permits had been forfeited. Further, the application for an extension of time to prevent forfeiture of a fourth certificate was denied. On August 20, 2021, the Company filed a Petition for Judicial Review of the Forfeiture Notice and has retained legal counsel to undertake the appeal process. SPS subsequently filed and was granted a Stay of the Forfeiture Notice on September 15, 2021. SPS filed its Opening Brief on March 28, 2022. The State Engineer filed its Answering Brief on July 8, 2022. SPS filed its Reply Brief on August 25, 2022. A hearing regarding the status of the forfeiture appeal was held in the Third Judicial Court District in Lyon County on November 4, 2022. On December 6, 2022, the Judge remanded the case back to the State for further written findings based on issues raised at the hearing. 

Page 5 of 10 

On August 30, 2023, SPS received written notice from the Nevada State Engineer in response to the Remand Order that the three water rights applications for Extensions of Time were denied and declared forfeited. The fourth certificate was not forfeited although the Extension of Time has not yet been approved. 
 On September 28, 2023, SPS simultaneously timely filed an Amended Petition for Review and a Complaint for Equitable Relief with the Third Judicial District Court in Lyon County, Nevada seeking judicial relief from the August 30 Forfeiture Notice. On October 10, 2023, the Judge signed an order granting a Stipulated Stay of August 30, 2023, Forfeiture Notice while the appeal process is ongoing. 
 The US firms representing SPS completed the briefing on the Amended Petition for Judicial Review and filed the opening brief on the Complaint for Equitable Relief. The hearing on both matters is tentatively scheduled to occur in the first quarter of 2025. The firms interviewed the likely witnesses in the matter and developed the Declarations in Support of the Equitable Relief briefing. The State of Nevada timely filed its responsive brief. SPS timely filed its reply brief on November 1, 2024. Further review of witness testimony is ongoing, and decisions are being contemplated regarding the necessity of expert testimony. The hearing, is tentatively scheduled for 1Q2025 in Lyon County Circuit Court. Simultaneously with diligently defending against the forfeiture, SPS seeks non-judicial resolutions with the State Engineer. 
 Just as SPS did with the initial forfeiture decision that was remanded by the Court, SPS continues to diligently defend against the wrongful forfeiture of its water rights with clear evidence of the need for those water rights in mine remediation, production and reclamation. 
 FALCON COPPER CORP. 
 Blue Copper Project, Montana 
 The Blue Copper project is a Butte-style copper-gold system in Powell County and Lewis Clark County in Montana, located 45 miles north of the world-famous Butte, Montana copper mines. District-scale land consolidation almost completely encompasses a prolific placer gold system with extensive copper showings. 
 Schell Creek Project, Nevada 
 The Schell Creek Project is composed of the Cabin and Muncy Properties in White Pine County, Nevada, which represent two immediately adjacent copper targets composed of approximately 15,000 acres of mineral claims. 
 The Cabin Property represents a potential major copper-moly porphyry discovery concealed beneath the Spring Valley pediment within a district-scale BLM land package, located immediately north of the Muncy Property. 
 Muncy Option to Joint Venture Agreement 
 On November 22, 2023, Falcon Copper Corp. entered into an Option to Joint Venture Agreement with Kennecott Exploration Company ("Kennecott"), a Rio Tinto subsidiary. 
 Pursuant to the Agreement, Kennecott grants FCC the sole and exclusive right and option to acquire 100 interest in the Muncy Property. To exercise this option, FCC must satisfy the following: 
 pay the Payment Commitment of 95,059 to Kennecott on or before the Effective Date of November 22, 2023 (Paid); 
 pay an additional payment commitment of 5,000 by February 18, 2024 (Paid); 

Page 6 of 10 

pay an additional payment commitment of 51,000 by July 1, 2024 (Paid); 
 incur exploration expenditures of 1,500,000 with respect to the Muncy Property and 1,000,000 with respect to the Cabin Property on or before November 22, 2025. 
 Upon FCC satisfying the exploration expenditures, Kennecott has the option to opt in for 40 of an asset-level joint venture for the Schell Creek Project; if Kennecott chooses to not opt in, FCC takes 100 ownership of the Muncy Property, along with the Cabin Property, with a Muncy Property royalty granted to Rio Tinto. 
 If FCC decides to terminate the option at any time, they will grant Kennecott a 2.0 net smelter royalty in the Cabin Property. After this is done, the agreement, except for specified sections, will terminate 
 If Kennecott elects not to form a joint venture, Kennecott must transfer all their rights in the Muncy Property to the FCC. In return, FCC will grant the optionor a 2.0 net smelter royalty (NSR) in the Properties. Before FCC decides to develop a commercial mining operation on any portion of the Properties, FCC has the right to reduce the net smelter royalty (NSR) from 2.0 to 1.0 by paying the optionor 10,000,000 in cash 
 Pioneer, Arizona 
 Pioneer is an approximate 1,300 acre covered target area prospective for high grade primary or enriched porphyry copper mineralization located within Arizona's prolific Copper Triangle - within 10 miles of the Resolution Ray mines. 
 Groundhog, Alaska 
 The Groundhog prospect lies on the Alaskan peninsula on state lands, within an established copper porphyry belt 200 miles southwest Anchorage. 
 Reconnaissance 
 FCC incurred reconnaissance evaluation expenditures on targets in Nevada, Arizona and Montana in order to determine whether they warranted further pursuit. 
 BLUE COPPER ROYALTIES, LLC 
 Blue Copper Royalties, LLC holds the Butte Valley Royalty and the Nieves interest. 
 The Butte Valley Royalty is represented by a 1.0 NSR, subject to a buy-down to a 0.5 NSR in exchange for an aggregate payment of 15 million. 
 The Nieves Interest is represented by a 5 net profits interest associated with the Nieves Silver property in Mexico. 
 Operating and Other Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred operating expenses of 2.665 million compared to 3.667 million in the prior period. The decrease of 1.002 million is primarily due to an increase in net Rio Tinto funding of 1.935 million as a result of stage 2(b) and 3 funding received, partially offset by professional fees in the current period related to convertible debenture and water rights dispute. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a 1.75 million loss on debenture conversion and repayment. The Company also recorded 0.789 million share-based payments expense versus 1.133 million expense in the same prior period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Company is an exploration stage company that has not earned any production revenue. Its operations have been dependent mainly on the Rio-Tinto agreement and private placements in the last few years without diluting shareholders' value. The Company may have capital requirements in excess of its currently available resources and may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient financing to meet its future capital requirements or that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company in the future. 
 On November 8, 2024, the company closed a non-brokered private placement by issuing 25,155,554 units at 0.045 per unit for gross proceeds of 1.13 million. Each Unit comprises one common share and one common share purchase warrant that exercisable at 0.06 till November 8, 2029. The Company intends to use the proceeds for general working capital purposes and repayment of convertible debentures. 
 The following table summarizes the Company's cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023:

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 5.487 million (December 31, 2023 - 2.31 million) and working capital deficit of 0.416 million (December 31, 2023 - 2.854 million). The decrease in the working capital deficit of 2.438 million is primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents of 3.177 million which was partially offset by an increase in the Rio Tinto deposit of 2.632 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had convertible debentures with a face value and a carrying value of 1.01 million. 
 On February 16, 2024, the Company issued 12-month convertible debentures of 0.941 million to replace previously issued debentures that were due in February 2024. These debentures are convertible into common shares of the Company at 0.06 (C 0.08) per share, or at the holder s option, are converted-in-kind for common shares of FCC at 0.25 per FCC shares. 15,696,883 share purchase warrants exercisable at 0.06 (C 0.08) per share were issued associated with these debentures which expire on February 16, 2025. 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company issued 4,107,998 units and 41,707,215 common shares to settle 1.924 million of existing debenture debt. The debenture holders converted their principal and interest into units of the Company at 0.045 (C 0.06) per Unit. Each Unit is comprised of one common share and one share purchase warrant. Each warrant is exercisable into one additional common share at a price of 0.06 (C 0.08) per share for a period of 5 years from the date of issuance. 
 In conjunction with the Company s CSE listing on September 19, 2024, 41,707,215 warrants were issued to certain directors and individuals who converted their debts into common shares of the Company on March 8, 2024. Each warrant is exercisable into one common share at 0.056 per share till September 19, 2029. These warrants were treated as a contingency with their fair value being recorded as a derivative liability on March 8, 2024. On September 19, 2024. These warrants were revalued at 359 and recorded as equity since all are exercisable in USD, the functional currency of the Company. 
 Additionally, on March 8, 2024, the Company repaid convertible debentures of a total of 0.831 million in cash. 
 The Company has no operating revenues and therefore must utilize its cashflows from financing transactions to maintain its capacity to meet ongoing operating activities.
