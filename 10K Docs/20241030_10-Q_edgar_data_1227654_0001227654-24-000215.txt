 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

1. 

The Company experiences a substantial amount of seasonality in its sales, including its salt deicing product sales. Consequently, Salt segment sales and operating income are generally higher in the first and second fiscal quarters (ending December 31 and March 31) and lower during the third and fourth fiscal quarters (ending June 30 and September 30). In particular, sales of highway and consumer deicing salt and magnesium chloride products vary based on the severity of the winter conditions in areas where the products are used. Following industry practice in North America and the U.K., the Company seeks to stockpile sufficient quantities of deicing salt throughout the first, third and fourth fiscal quarters (ending December 31, June 30 and September 30) to meet the estimated requirements for the winter season. Production of deicing salt can also vary based on the severity or mildness of the preceding winter season. Due to the seasonal nature of the deicing product lines, operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year. The Company s plant nutrition business is also seasonal. As a result, the Company and its customers generally build inventories during the plant nutrition business low demand periods of the year (which are typically winter and summer, but can vary due to weather and other factors) to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons (which are typically spring and autumn, but can also vary due to weather and other factors). Lastly, the results of the Company s fire retardant business are also seasonal with peak demand for fire retardant products and services occurring from June through September. 
 
 The Company previously identified various misstatements related to (i) certain contingent consideration associated with the Company s acquisition of Fortress North America, LLC Fortress ), (ii) historical understatement of work-in-process inventory, (iii) immaterial misstatements to reclassify the impacts of non-cash capital expenditures in accounts payable in its operating and investing cash flows, (iv) an error in its interim non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA calculation, which resulted in an understatement of its consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the first and second quarters of 2024, and (v) certain other individual immaterial misstatements that were also immaterial in the aggregate. These misstatements were corrected via amendments to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, both filed on October 29, 2024.

 million (finite-lived intangible assets) and an impairment of million of inventory for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. The long-lived asset impairment is included in loss on impairments, while the inventory impairment is reflected in product cost, both on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The undiscounted cash flows for the remaining Fortress assets were greater than their carrying value resulting in no incremental impairment. Management will continue to monitor events and circumstances that would require a future test of recoverability on the remaining Fortress long-lived assets. 
 
 The Company performed the interim goodwill impairment tests consistent with its approach for annual impairment testing, including using similar models, inputs and assumptions. As a result of the interim goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recognized impairment charges totaling million included in loss on impairments, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. Goodwill impairment of million was related to the Company s Plant Nutrition segment, primarily due to decreases in projected future revenues and cash flows and an increase in discount rates due to the uncertain regulatory environment in Utah. The remaining goodwill impairment of million was related to the Company s Fortress reporting unit (included in the Corporate and Other segment), primarily due to changes in assumptions surrounding the magnesium chloride-based fire retardants which impacted projected future revenues and cash flows. Following the impairment charges, there is no remaining goodwill balance for the Plant Nutrition and Fortress reporting units. Refer to Note 6 for a summary of goodwill by segment.

In connection with the aforementioned impairments, the Company determined the estimated fair value for each reporting unit based on discounted cash flow projections (income approach), market values for comparable businesses (market approach) or a combination of both. Under the income approach, the Company is required to make judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows used in its estimates are based on the reporting unit's forecast, long-term business plan, and recent operating performance. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions. The Company s estimates may differ from actual future cash flows. The risk adjusted discount rate used is consistent with the weighted average cost of capital of the Company s peer companies and is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant. Under the market approach, market multiples are derived from market prices of stocks of companies in the Company s peer group. The appropriate multiple is applied to the forecasted revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the reporting unit to obtain an estimated fair value. 
 
 The most critical assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit are the projected revenue growth rates, long-term operating margin, terminal growth rates, discount rate, and the selection of market multiples. The projected long term operating margin utilized in the Company s fair value estimates is consistent with its operating plan and is dependent

Building upon the previous minority ownership stake in Fortress, the transaction provided the Company full ownership of all Fortress assets, contracts, and intellectual property. See Note 1 for impairment information. See Note 13 for fair value information related to the contingent consideration as of June 30, 2024.

 The Company had been pursuing the development of a sustainable lithium salt resource to support the North American battery market. The passage of Utah House Bill 513 in March 2023 and the subsequent rulemaking process altered certain aspects of the regulatory landscape that will govern the development of lithium at the Great Salt Lake, introducing uncertainty into how development would proceed. As previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K/A, the Company indefinitely paused new investment in its lithium development project pending greater clarity on the evolving regulatory environment in Utah. In December of 2023, a revised draft of the aforementioned rulemaking was published that continued to be, in the Company's assessment, adverse to its lithium development project. In addition, in December of 2023, the Company further refined its engineering estimates that, taken together with the proposed rules and decline in market price for lithium products, would result in inadequate risk-adjusted returns on capital. 
 
 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, including million associated with future commitments as of June 30, 2024. The impairments were recorded to reflect the assets at their estimated fair value, considering equipment expected to be used by the on-going business and amounts estimated to be recoverable through returns or salvage value. Prior to recognizing an impairment, the Company had capitalized million to its property, plant and equipment on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and has approximately million remaining as of June 30, 2024, included in inventory. The Company engaged a valuation specialist to assist in determining the appropriate fair value of the lithium assets and the resulting impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Given the assets are likely to either be used in other operations or liquidated at a later date, the Company utilized a market-based approach that relied on Level 3 inputs (see Note 13

In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, there were indicators necessitating an interim impairment test of the Company s goodwill based on the Company s review of its operating performance, among other factors, for the relevant reporting units. Refer to Note 1 for additional details. In addition to the Plant Nutrition and Fortress impairments, the remaining change in goodwill between September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, was due to the impact from translating foreign-denominated amounts to U.S. dollars. 
 
 In connection with the Fortress acquisition described in Note 2 , the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets which consisted of customer relationships, developed technology, in-process research and development and trade name. The fair values were determined using Level 3 inputs (see Note 13 for a discussion of the levels in the fair value hierarchy). Upon acquisition, the fair value of the customer relationships was estimated using an income approach method while the fair values of developed technology, in-process research and development and trade name were estimated using the relief from royalty method. 
 
 As a result of the Fortress-related impairments discussed in Note 1 , the Company impaired all magnesium chloride-related assets which resulted in an impairment of the Company s developed technology intangible asset of million, net of accumulated amortization of million. The Company continues to have Fortress-related net intangible assets consisting of customer relationships and trade name of million and million, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. The Company also has million of indefinite-lived in-process research and development recognized in connection with the Fortress acquisition as of June 30, 2024, which will be reviewed for impairment at least annually, or in the event of indicators of impairment, until product development is completed.

 million, foreign income, mining and withholding taxes, base erosion and anti-abuse tax, and valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets. 
 
 The effective tax rates applied to the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 were determined by excluding the U.S. losses from the overall estimated annual effective tax rate computations and a separate estimated annual effective tax rate was computed and applied to the ordinary U.S. losses. 
 
 Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in the U.S. over the three-year period ended June 30, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company s projections for future income. On the basis of this evaluation, during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, an additional valuation allowance of million has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the U.S. deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be realized. The additional valuation allowance is primarily the result of impairments recognized during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as the Company s projections for income.

 Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, consist principally of prepaid expenses, including prepaid tax assets of million and million, respectively. 
 
 Canadian provincial tax authorities have challenged tax positions claimed by one of the Company s Canadian subsidiaries and have issued tax reassessments for fiscal years 2002-2018. The reassessments are a result of ongoing audits and total million, including interest, through June 30, 2024. The Company disputes these reassessments and will continue to work with the appropriate authorities in Canada to resolve the dispute. There is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate resolution of this dispute, and any related disputes for other open tax years, may be materially higher or lower than the amounts the Company has reserved for such disputes. In connection with this dispute, local regulations require the Company to post security with the tax authority until the dispute is resolved. The Company has posted collateral in the form of a million performance bond and has paid million to the Canadian tax authorities (most of which is recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023), which is necessary to proceed with future appeals or litigation. 
 
 The Company expects that it will be required by local regulations to provide security for additional interest on the above unresolved disputed amounts and for any future reassessments issued by these Canadian tax authorities in the form of cash, letters of credit, performance bonds, asset liens or other arrangements agreeable with the tax authorities until the disputes are resolved. 
 
 The Company expects that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters, and the impact could be material if they are not resolved in the Company s favor. As of June 30, 2024, the Company believes it has adequately reserved for these reassessments. 
 
 Additionally, the Company has other uncertain tax positions as well as assessments and disputed positions with taxing authorities in its various jurisdictions, which are consistent with those matters disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K/A.

 On March 27, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its 2023 Credit Agreement, which eased the restrictions of certain covenants contained in the agreement. The amendment included increasing the maximum allowed consolidated total net leverage ratio (as defined and calculated under the terms of the amended 2023 Credit Agreement) to x as of the last day of any quarter through the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, then gradually stepping down to x by the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2026 and thereafter. The amendment also removed the flexibility related to the lithium development joint ventures, projects or similar arrangements and any related funding transactions in connection therewith. In connection with this amendment, the Company paid fees totaling million which were capitalized as deferred financing costs. Additional arrangement and legal fees of million were expensed as of March 31, 2024.

 million which were capitalized as deferred financing costs. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, the term loan and revolving credit facility under the 2023 Credit Agreement were secured by substantially all existing and future U.S. assets of the Company, the Goderich mine in Ontario, Canada and capital stock of certain subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement was approximately and , respectively. Depending on the type, borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, Prime Rate or the CDO Rate (as defined in the credit agreement), as applicable, plus Applicable Margins (as defined in the credit agreement) which resulted in interest rates between and as of June 30, 2024, and and as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, the Company had million of availability under its million revolving credit facility. The 2023 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total net leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance as of June 30, 2024 with its debt covenants under the 2023 Credit Agreement and its AR Securitization Facility.

Natural Gas Derivative Instruments 
 
 Natural gas is consumed at several of the Company s production facilities, and changes in natural gas prices impact the Company s operating margin. The Company seeks to reduce the earnings and cash flow impacts of changes in market prices of natural gas by fixing the purchase price of up to of its forecasted natural gas usage. It is the Company s policy to consider hedging portions of its natural gas usage up to months in advance of the forecasted purchase. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had entered into natural gas derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its natural gas purchase requirements through December 2025. As of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had agreements in place to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases of million a nd million MMBtus, respectively. 
 
 On March 1, 2023, the Company de-designated its natural gas cash flow hedges related to its Ogden, Utah production facility as the Company did not believe these hedges were probable of being highly effective in the second fiscal quarter of 2023. Beginning March 1, 2023, the change in the derivative was and will be recorded in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Since the transactions are still probable of occurring, previously recognized amounts in AOCL of million remain in AOCL until the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. The Company recognized million and million of expense in other expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. Following the de-designation, these natural gas economic hedging instruments will be recorded at fair value through earnings unless re-designated or until settlement. Substantially all other natural gas derivative instruments held by the Company as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2024, the Company expects to reclassify from AOCL to earnings during the next twelve months million of net losses on derivative instruments related to its natural gas hedges. Refer to Note 13 for the estimated fair value of the Company s natural gas derivative instruments as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

The Company s investments related to its non-qualified retirement plan of million at June 30, 2024 and million at September 30, 2023, are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices. As of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company s fixed-rate Senior Notes due December 2027, based on available trading information (Level 2), totaled million and million, respectively, compared with the aggregate principal amount at maturity of million.

 In connection with the acquisition of Fortress, the Company entered into a contingent consideration arrangement (milestone and earnout payments). The fair value of the milestone contingent consideration is estimated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model with significant inputs not observable in the market and is therefore considered a Level 3 measurement while the earn-out is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation, also a Level 3 measurement. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded income of million and million, respectively. The change in the three months ended June 30, 2024 is reflective of updated financial performance, changes in discount rates and the passage of time. The change in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 is also reflective of milestone and earn-out payments made related to calendar year 2023 activity and recent developments related to the Company s magnesium chloride-based fire retardants, as discussed further in Note 1 . The change is recorded in other operating (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to reflect the contingent consideration liability at its fair value as of June 30, 2024. The Company will continue to recognize remeasurement changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration in earnings at each reporting date until all contingencies are resolved. Refer to Note 2 for a discussion of the milestone and earnout payments.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments result primarily from the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K/A, describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 As previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K and as discussed in Item 1, Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we indefinitely paused new investment in the lithium salt project pending greater clarity on the evolving regulatory environment in Utah. In December of 2023, a revised draft of rules was proposed, project engineering estimates were refined and, taken together with the decline in market price of lithium products, we determined to terminate the lithium development. Consequently, we evaluated the capitalized assets and recorded an impairment charge of 74.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, including 5.3 million associated with future commitments as of June 30, 2024. The impairment charges were recognized to value the assets at estimated fair value, considering equipment expected to be used by the on-going business and amounts estimated to be recoverable through returns or salvage value. The determination of fair value of these assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions that include, but are not limited to, estimated proceeds to be received upon sale or return of the equipment, assumptions about the ability to redeploy equipment and materials to other parts of the business and estimates regarding the utility value and replacement cost of the equipment redeployed. Actual proceeds received from asset sales or returns and our ability to utilize the assets may vary from our estimates resulting in further impairment. 
 
 As discussed in Item 1, Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as a result of a sustained decrease in our publicly quoted share price and market capitalization continuing into fiscal 2024 and recent developments related to our magnesium chloride-based fire retardants impacting our Fortress business, we determined that there were indicators for impairment which necessitated impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result of the evaluation, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment, net, of 15.6 million, an inventory impairment of 2.4 million and goodwill impairment of 32.0 million related to Fortress and goodwill impairment of 51.0 million related to Plant Nutrition as of March 31, 2024. Failure to obtain full qualification by the USFS or a decision by the USFS not to enter into commercial agreements with respect to Fortress s magnesium or non-magnesium chloride-based fire retardant products could result in additional impairments related to the Fortress business. In connection with the impairments, we determined the estimated fair value for each reporting unit based on discounted cash flow projections (income approach), market values for comparable businesses (market approach) or a combination of both. The determination of fair value of the reporting units requires us to make estimates and assumptions that include, but are not limited to, discount rates, long-term revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Our estimates may differ from actual future cash flows. Management does not believe that the remaining goodwill balance in its Corporate and Other reporting unit is currently at risk of impairment as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 For a further description of our critical accounting policies, see Item 1, Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates.

We are evaluating various alternatives regarding the path forward for the Fortress business given recent developments. Refer to the discussion above in Critical Accounting Estimates and in Item 1, Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 
 
 Additionally, we had been pursuing development of a sustainable lithium salt resource near Ogden, UT to support the North American battery market. However, as discussed above in Critical Accounting Policies and in Item 1, Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have terminated our pursuit of the lithium development.

 Commentary: Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 
 Total sales decreased 2 , or 4.7 million, due to lower Plant Nutrition segment sales and lower sales from our Fortress business, partially offset by higher Salt segment sales. The decrease in sales for Plant Nutrition reflected lower sales volumes and average sales prices. Fortress has not been awarded a contract for the 2024 fire season. Salt sales increased from the prior year due to an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by slightly lower sales volumes. 
 Operating income of 5.9 million increased 6.5 million from an operating loss of 0.6 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher Salt operating earnings and lower Corporate and Other and lithium expenses, which was partially offset by lower Plant Nutrition and Fortress operating earnings. Salt operating income increased primarily due to a 4 increase in average sales prices. Corporate and Other operating loss decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower compensation and professional services expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Plant Nutrition operating earnings due to decreases in sales volumes and average sales prices. 
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA adjusted for items management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.7 , or 4.2 million, benefiting from a 0.9 million gain recorded in the current period related to the decline in the valuation of the Fortress contingent consideration. 
 Diluted net loss per common share of 1.05 decreased by 1.93 from net earnings of 0.88 per common share in the prior-year period.

 Commentary: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 Total sales decreased 6 , or 62.5 million, due to lower Salt segment sales, partially offset by sales by the Fortress fire retardant business and slightly higher Plant Nutrition segment sales. The decrease in Salt sales was primarily driven by lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average sales prices. The increase in Plant Nutrition sales from the prior year primarily reflects higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower average sales price. 
 Operating loss of 87.0 million decreased 162.2 million from operating income of 75.2 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the impairments related to our previous lithium development project (see Item 1, Note 5 ), our Fortress business and the Plant Nutrition segment (see Item 1, Note 1 and lower Plant Nutrition operating earnings. Corporate and Other operating loss increased from the prior year primarily due to a 74.8 million lithium asset impairment and 50.0 million of goodwill, long-lived asset and inventory impairments related to the Fortress business. The increases were partially offset by the net non-cash reduction in our Fortress-related contingent consideration of 23.1 million. Plant Nutrition operating earnings decreased due primarily to a 51.0 million goodwill impairment and lower sales prices, which were partially offset by lower per-unit product and distribution costs. In addition, Salt operating earnings increased slightly due to higher average sales prices, which was mostly offset by lower Salt sales volumes and higher per-unit product costs, partially offset by higher average sales prices. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by 14 , or 22.9 million, benefiting from a 23.1 million net gain recorded in the current year-to-date period related to the decline in the valuation of the Fortress contingent consideration. 
 Diluted net loss per common share of 3.83 decreased by 4.18 from net earnings of 0.35 per common share in the prior-year period.

 Gross Profit: Decreased 6 , or 2.0 million; Gross Margin decreased 1 percentage point to 16 
 Salt segment gross profit increased 2.9 million primarily due to higher average sale prices, partially offset by higher per-unit product costs and slightly lower sales volumes (see Salt operating results). 
 The gross profit of the Plant Nutrition segment decreased 4.1 million due to lower average sales prices and volumes (see Plant Nutrition operating results). 
 Gross profit was also negatively impacted by costs incurred related to the Fortress fire retardant business acquired in May 2023. 
 
 Commentary: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 Gross Profit: Decreased 8 , or 14.3 million; Gross Margin decreased 1 percentage point to 19 
 Salt segment gross profit decreased 2.9 primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher per-unit product costs, which were partially offset by higher average sales prices (see Salt operating results). 
 The gross profit of the Plant Nutrition segment decreased 19.0 million due to lower average sales prices, which were partially offset by lower per-unit product and distribution costs and higher sales volumes (see Plant Nutrition operating results). 
 Gross profit was also favorably impacted by the acquisition of the Fortress fire retardant business in May 2023.

 OTHER EXPENSES AND INCOME 
 
 Commentary: Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 
 SG A: Decreased 5.5 million; Decreased 2.3 percentage points as a percentage of sales from 15.9 to 13.6 
 The decrease in SG A expense was primarily due to lower corporate, Salt and lithium expenses, which was partially offset by expenses related to our Fortress fire retardant business that was acquired in May 2023. 
 
 Other Operating (Income) Expense: Decreased 3.0 million from expense of 2.2 million to income of 0.8 million 
 The decrease in other operating expense was primarily the result of lower restructuring charges in the current period and a 0.9 million gain in the contingent consideration related to the Fortress acquisition due to changes in projected revenues and cash flows from our magnesium chloride-based fire retardants. 
 
 Interest Income: Decreased 1.5 million to 0.2 million 
 The decrease in interest income during the current period is primarily due to the higher average cash balance in the prior year resulting from proceeds received from a private placement of our common stock. 
 
 Interest Expense: Increased 2.9 million to 17.2 million 
 Interest expense increased 2.9 million due to higher interest rates and debt levels in the current period. 
 
 (Gain) Loss on Foreign Exchange: Increased 2.8 million from a loss of 2.3 million to a gain of 0.5 million 
 We realized a gain on foreign exchange of 0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to a loss of 2.3 million in the same quarter of the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the translation of our intercompany loans from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. 
 
 Net Loss in Equity Investees: 0.8 million in the prior-year period 
 We realized a net loss of 0.8 million in the prior-year period reflecting our share of losses related to our equity investments as these development stage businesses positioned themselves for commercialization. 
 
 Gain from Remeasurement of Equity Method Investment 
 We recognized a gain of 12.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 related to our previously held equity investment in Fortress, which was remeasured to fair value upon our full acquisition of the business in May 2023. 
 
 Other Expense, net: Decreased 2.4 million to 0.3 million 
 The decrease is due primarily to losses on cash flow hedges and fees paid to refinance our debt. in the prior period. 
 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit): Decreased 75.5 million from a benefit of 42.8 million to an expense of 32.7 million 
 The tax expense of 32.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 is primarily due to a change in the annual effective tax rate calculations with the US loss jurisdiction having a separate annual effective tax rate applied to US losses and a foreign annual effective tax rate applied to foreign income. The tax benefit of 42.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the impact in the quarter of the acquisition of the Fortress business to the full year effective tax rate. See Item 1, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our effective tax rate was (300 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, which is primarily driven by the income mix by country with income recognized in foreign jurisdictions, for which tax expense was recorded, offset by losses recognized in the U.S. for which a valuation allowance has been recorded against the U.S. tax benefit carryforward. 
 Our income tax provision for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to U.S. statutory depletion, state income taxes, base erosion and anti-abuse tax, nondeductible executive compensation, foreign income, mining and withholding taxes and valuation allowance expense. 
 
 Commentary: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 
 SG A: Decreased 2.7 million; increased 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of sales from 11.2 to 11.7 
 The increase in SG A expense was primarily due to lower corporate incentive compensation and lower lithium expenses, which was partially offset by expenses related to our Fortress fire retardant business that was acquired in May 2023.

 Loss on Impairments: 173.4 million in the current-year period 
 During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized goodwill impairments of 51.0 million related to our Plant Nutrition segment and 32.0 million related to our Fortress operations (within the Corporate and Other segment). The Plant Nutrition impairment was primarily the result of reduced cash flow assumptions impacting expected profitability of the Plant Nutrition segment. The Fortress impairment was primarily related to uncertainty surrounding our magnesium chloride-based fire retardants which impacted projected future revenues and cash flows. Also, during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a 15.6 million long-lived asset impairment, net, related to Fortress magnesium chloride-based products. See Item 1, Note 1 for additional information. 
 We recognized an impairment loss of 74.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 related to the termination of the lithium development (see Item 1, Note 5 ). 
 
 Other Operating (Income) Expense: Decreased 22.8 million from expense of 5.4 million to income of 17.4 million 
 The decrease in other operating expense was due to a decrease in the contingent consideration related to the Fortress acquisition, partially offset by severance costs resulting from the decision to discontinue the pursuit of the lithium development and corporate restructuring charges in the current period. 
 
 Interest Income: Decreased 3.9 million from 4.7 million to 0.8 million 
 The decrease in interest income during the current period is primarily due to a higher average cash balance in the prior period resulting from proceeds received from the private placement of our common stock. 
 
 Interest Expense: Increased 8.0 million to 50.4 million 
 Interest expense increased due to higher debt levels and higher interest rates in the current period. 
 
 (Gain) Loss on Foreign Exchange: Rose by 5.7 million from a loss of 4.6 million to a gain of 1.1 million 
 We realized a gain on foreign exchange of 1.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to a loss of 4.6 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year, due primarily reflecting the translation of our intercompany loans from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars.

 We realized a net loss of 3.1 million in the prior-year period reflecting our share of losses related to our equity investments as these development stage businesses positioned themselves for commercialization. 
 
 Gain from Remeasurement of Equity Method Investment 
 We recognized a gain of 12.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 related to our previously held equity investment in Fortress, which was remeasured to fair value upon our full acquisition of the business in May 2023. 
 
 Other Expense, net: Decreased 1.8 million to 1.9 million 
 The decrease is due primarily to losses on cash flow hedges and fees paid to refinance our debt in the prior period. 
 
 Income Tax Expense: Decreased 3.8 million from 24.2 million to 20.4 million 
 The decrease in income tax expense was due primarily to a decrease in pretax book income, excluding impairments, in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023. Additionally, the majority of the impairments recorded in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were either not tax deductible or the tax benefit was offset by tax expense for a valuation allowance on the related deferred tax asset. 
 Our effective tax rate of (14.8 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 is primarily driven by the income mix by country with income recognized in foreign jurisdictions offset by losses recognized in the U.S., for which a valuation allowance has been recorded against the U.S. tax benefit carryforward. Additionally, the majority of the impairments recorded in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were either not tax deductible or the tax benefit was offset by tax expense for a valuation allowance on the related deferred tax asset. See Item 1, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Plant Nutrition sales volumes increased 22 , or 37,000 tons, which resulted in a 30.0 million increase in sales driven by normalization of demand levels in fiscal 2024 following lower demand in fiscal 2023 reflective of impacts from weather events in key markets and uncertainty regarding future fertilizer prices causing customers to cancel or delay purchases. 
 Plant Nutrition average sales prices decreased 17 , partially offsetting the increase in sales volume by 28.2 million. Average sales prices decreased throughout fiscal 2024 due to global supply and demand dynamics for fertilizer products resulting in weakening pricing year over year. 
 Plant Nutrition operating earnings decreased 69.5 million to an operating loss of 56.7 million primarily reflecting the write-off of goodwill and lower average sales prices, which were partially offset by lower per-unit product and distribution costs and higher sales volumes. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 Salt sales volumes and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024 are expected to range from 9.2 million to 9.4 million tons and 215 million to 225 million, respectively, and reflect the exceptionally mild winter across our core service markets over the North American highway deicing season. Our financial results reflect the curtailment of production at our Goderich mine to reduce the inventory levels going into the coming deicing season. 
 Approximately 70 of the company's North American highway deicing bidding process for the upcoming winter season has been completed. Based on regional bid results to date, we expect our average contract selling price for the coming season to be approximately 2 lower than prices in fiscal 2024. Market bid volumes are expected to be down approximately 7 to 10 compared to fiscal 2024, which is consistent with expectations given inventory levels across the service market and producer supply positions following two consecutive mild winters. 
 Plant Nutrition segment sales volumes and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be within a range of 265,000 to 275,000 tons and 21 million to 26 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2024. 
 Fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures are now expected to be in the 115 million to 130 million range. This includes approximately 80 million to 90 million in sustaining capital for the core Salt and Plant Nutrition businesses. In the fire retardant business, approximately 5 million to 10 million has been budgeted for fiscal year 2024, with approximately 4 million invested through the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Finally, we expect capital expenditures of roughly 30 million related to the now-terminated lithium project for items that had been committed to prior to the project s suspension in November 2023. As a result of the termination of the lithium project and the related impairments in the first half of fiscal 2024, a portion of the expenditures related to committed items that had not been received by December 31, 2023, will not be classified as capital expenditures within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows when paid.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically, our cash flows from operating activities have generally been adequate to fund our basic operating requirements, ongoing debt service and sustaining investment in our property, plant and equipment. We have also used cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, fund smaller acquisitions and repay our debt. To a certain extent, our ability to meet our short- and long-term liquidity and capital needs is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and weather conditions, effects of climate change, geological variations in our mine deposits and other factors that are beyond our control. Historically, our working capital requirements have been the highest in the first fiscal quarter (ending December 31) and lowest in the third fiscal quarter (ending June 30). When needed, we may fund short-term working capital requirements by accessing our 375 million revolving credit facility and our 100.0 million revolving AR Securitization Facility. As of June 30, 2024, we had liquidity of approximately 220.8 million, comprised of 12.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and 208.0 million of availability under our 375 million revolving credit facility. 
 
 We have been able to manage our cash flows generated and used across Compass Minerals to indefinitely reinvest earnings in our foreign jurisdictions or efficiently repatriate those funds to the U.S. As of June 30, 2024, we had 10.9 million of cash and cash equivalents that was either held directly or indirectly by foreign subsidiaries. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we revised our permanently reinvested assertion, expecting to repatriate approximately 150 million of unremitted foreign earnings from Canada. Throughout fiscal years 2022 and 2023, we increased our repatriation expectation to include an additional 16 million from our U.K. operations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, 89.2 million was repatriated from Canada and in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, 15.6 million was repatriated from the U.K. Net income tax expense of 3.8 million has been recorded for foreign withholding tax, state income tax and foreign exchange losses on these changes in assertion as of June 30, 2024, consisting of a tax benefit of 0.7 million recorded in fiscal 2023 and tax expense of 4.5 million, most of which was recorded in years prior to fiscal 2021. It is our current intention to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely. We review our tax circumstances on a regular basis with the intent of optimizing cash accessibility and minimizing tax expense. 
 
 In addition, the amount of permanently reinvested earnings is influenced by, among other things, the profits generated by our foreign subsidiaries and the amount of investment in those same subsidiaries. The profits generated by our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries are impacted by the transfer price charged on the transfer of our products between them. Canadian provincial taxing authorities continue to challenge our transfer prices of certain items. The final resolution of these challenges may not occur for several years. We currently expect the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our results of operations. However, it is possible the resolution could materially impact the amount of earnings attributable to our foreign subsidiaries, which could impact the amount of permanently reinvested foreign earnings. See Item 1, Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding our Canadian tax reassessments. 
 
 Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred in the U.S. over the three-year period ended December 31, 2023. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future income. On the basis of this evaluation, during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, an additional valuation allowance of 28.0 million has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the U.S. deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for income. 
 
 Indebtedness 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, we had 880.7 million of outstanding indebtedness, consisting of 500.0 million outstanding under our 6.75 Senior Notes due 2027, 346.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities under the Credit Agreement, consisting of 195.0 million of term loans and 151.9 million borrowed against our revolving credit facility, and 33.8 million of outstanding loans under the accounts receivable financing facility (see Item 1, Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail regarding our debt). Outstanding letters of credit totaling 15.1 million as of June 30, 2024 further reduced available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to 208.0 million. 
 
 We may borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility or enter into additional financing to fund our working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.

 Our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, to refinance our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and to fund acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, climate-related, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations, we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash, together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. 
 
 Our debt service obligations could, under certain circumstances, materially affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. As a holding company, CMI s investments in its operating subsidiaries constitute substantially all of its assets. Consequently, our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operating activities and own substantially all of our operating assets. The principal source of the cash needed to pay our obligations is the cash generated from our subsidiaries operations and their borrowings. Furthermore, we must remain in compliance with the terms of the 2023 Credit Agreement governing our credit facilities, including the consolidated total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, in order to pay dividends to our stockholders. We must also comply with the terms of our indenture governing our 6.75 Senior Notes due December 2027, which limit the amount of dividends we can pay to our stockholders. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our 2023 Credit Agreement, which eased the restrictions of certain covenants contained in the agreement. The amendment included increasing the maximum allowed consolidated total net leverage ratio (as defined and calculated under the terms of the amended 2023 Credit Agreement) to 6.5x as of the last day of any quarter through the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, gradually stepping down to 4.75x for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2026 and thereafter. The amendment also removed the flexibility related to the lithium development joint ventures, projects or similar arrangements and any related funding transactions in connection therewith. Consolidated total net debt includes the aggregate principal amount of total debt, net of unrestricted cash not to exceed 75.0 million. As of June 30, 2024, our consolidated total net leverage ratio was approximately 4.3x. 
 
 Although we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of June 30, 2024, we can make no assurance that we will remain in compliance with these ratios. Furthermore, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity; however, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, certain of our U.S. subsidiaries entered into an amendment to our revolving accounts receivable financing facility (the AR Facility with PNC Bank, National Association, extending the facility to March 2027. 
 
 On August 12, 2024, we entered into amendments to our 2023 Credit Agreement and our AR Facility, which extended the deadline for delivery of our June 30, 2024 financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, together with the respective compliance certificates, from 45 days to 75 days after the last day of the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 On September 13, 2024, we entered into amendments to our 2023 Credit Agreement and our AR Facility, which extended the deadline for delivery of our June 30, 2024 financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, together with the respective compliance certificates, to November 29, 2024, 152 days after the last day of the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 On September 18, 2024, we received a notice of default relating to its 6.750 Senior Notes due 2027 because we failed to timely furnish a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024. We have 90 days from receipt of the notice to remedy prior to it becoming an Event of Default under the terms of the Indenture, dated November 29, 2019. 
 Capital Allocation 
 
 Principally due to the nature of our deicing business, our cash flows from operations have historically been seasonal, with the majority of our cash flows from operations generated during the first half of the calendar year. When we have not been able to meet our short-term liquidity or capital needs with cash from operations, whether as a result of the seasonality of our business or other causes, we have met those needs with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect to meet the ongoing requirements for debt service, any declared dividends and capital expenditures from these sources. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 
 We manage our capital allocation considering our long-term strategic objectives, required spending to sustain our business and focus on generating adequate returns on capital. On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors determined not to declare dividends for the foreseeable future in order to align our capital allocation policy with our corporate focus on accelerating cash flow generation and debt reduction. While our equipment and facilities are generally not impacted by rapid technology changes, our operations require refurbishments and replacements to maintain structural integrity and reliable production and shipping

 capabilities. When possible, we incorporate efficiency, environmental and safety improvement capabilities into our routine capital projects and we plan the timing of larger projects to balance with our liquidity and capital resources. Changes in our operating cash flows may affect our future capital allocation and spending. 
 
 During fiscal 2024, we expect to spend between 80 million and 90 million of sustaining capital in our Salt and Plant Nutrition businesses. We incurred approximately 24.4 million, including amounts accrued and unpaid, of previously committed capital in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 (approximately 75.7 million cumulatively) towards the development phase of our former lithium development project. However, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we ceased further development of the lithium project. For more information, refer to Item 1, Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K/A.

As mentioned above, our Salt segment s business is seasonal and our Salt segment results and working capital needs are heavily impacted by the severity and timing of the winter weather, which generally occurs from December through March of each year. Customers tend to replenish their inventory prior to the start of the winter season and following snow events; consequently, the number and timing of snow events during the winter season will impact the amount of our accounts receivable and inventory at the end of each quarter. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, we also paid liabilities accrued as of September 30, 2023, including the remaining 10 million settlement payment to the SEC, accrued incentive compensation, and other liabilities. Additionally, at the end of Fortress contract term with the USFS, we recognized revenue previously deferred in accrued liabilities and decreased our contingent consideration liability due to recent revisions of potential payouts. Our operating cash flows during the nine months ended June 30, 2023, reflect the Plant Nutrition build of inventory at higher costs and reduced accounts receivable as compared to the beginning of the prior year, reflective of the reduced demand in that segment, partially offset by a decline in Salt inventory levels following the end of the winter season. Additionally, Salt accounts receivable also declined as the prior season early fill winter season sales were collected.

Other Matters 
 
 See Item 1, Notes 7 and 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding labor, environmental and litigation matters. 

Reconciliation of Net Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Management uses a variety of measures to evaluate our performance. While our consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, provide an understanding of our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, we analyze components of the consolidated financial statements to identify certain trends and evaluate specific performance areas. In addition to using U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as gross profit, net earnings and cash flows generated by operating activities, management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of our core business operations because our resource allocation, financing methods, cost of capital and income tax positions are managed at a corporate level, apart from the activities of the operating segments, and our operating facilities are located in different taxing jurisdictions, which can cause considerable variation in net earnings. We also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our operating performance and return on capital against other companies, and to evaluate potential acquisitions or other capital projects. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows or other financial data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as a measure of our overall profitability or liquidity. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, each of which are an essential element of our cost structure and cannot be eliminated. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA excludes other cash and non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, interest income, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, other (income) expense, net and other significant items that management does not consider indicative of normal operations. Other significant items, such as executive transition costs, restructuring charges and impairment charges involve distinct initiatives that are not reflective of core operating activities and affect the comparability of our operational results across reporting periods. Our borrowings are a significant component of our capital structure and interest expense is a continuing cost of debt. We are also required to pay income taxes, a required and ongoing consequence of our operations. We have a significant investment in capital assets and depreciation and amortization reflect the utilization of those assets in order to generate revenues. Our employees are vital to our operations and we utilize various stock-based awards to compensate and incentivize our employees. Consequently, any measure that excludes these elements has material limitations. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as measures of operating performance, these terms are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Part 1, Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 

Effects of Currency Fluctuations and Inflation 
 
 Our operations outside of the U.S. are conducted primarily in Canada and the U.K. Therefore, our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk. We incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. With respect to currency translation risk, our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our historical consolidated financial statements. Exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly from time to time and may do so in the future. The majority of revenues and costs are denominated in U.S. dollars, with Canadian dollars and British pounds sterling also being significant. Significant changes in the value of the Canadian dollar or British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on U.S. dollar-denominated debt, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities. 
 
 Although inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations in the current period, our efforts to recover inflation-based cost increases from our customers may be hampered as a result of the structure of our contracts and the contract bidding process as well as the competitive industries, economic conditions and countries in which we operate. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K/A. 

Seasonality 
 
 We experience a substantial amount of seasonality in our sales, including our salt deicing product sales. Consequently, our Salt segment sales and operating income are generally higher in the first and second fiscal quarters (ending December 31 and March 31) and lower during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each year (ending June 30 and September 30). In particular, sales of highway and consumer deicing salt and magnesium chloride products vary based on the severity of the winter conditions in areas where the product is used. Following industry practice in North America and the U.K., we seek to stockpile sufficient 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

 quantities of deicing salt throughout the first, third and fourth fiscal quarters (ending December 31, June 30 and September 30) to meet the estimated requirements for the winter season. Our Plant Nutrition business is also seasonal. As a result, we and our customers generally build inventories during the Plant Nutrition business low demand periods of the year (which are typically winter and summer, but can vary due to weather and other factors) to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons (which are typically spring and autumn, but can also vary due to weather and other factors). Lastly, the results of our fire retardant business are also seasonal with peak demand for fire retardant products and services occurring from June through September. 
 
 Climate Change 
 
 The potential impact of climate change on our operations, product demand and the needs of our customers remains uncertain. Significant changes to weather patterns, a reduction in average snowfall or regional drought within our served markets or at our Ogden facility could negatively impact customer demand for our products and our costs, as well as our ability to produce our products. For example, prolonged periods of mild winter weather could reduce the demand for our deicing products. Drought or excessive precipitation could similarly impact demand for our SOP products, as well as continue to impact the amount and quality of feedstock used to produce SOP at our Ogden facility due to changes in brine levels, mineral concentrations or other factors, which could have a material impact on our Plant Nutrition results of operations. Climate change could also lead to disruptions in the production or distribution of our products due to major storm events or prolonged adverse conditions, changing temperature levels, lake level fluctuations or flooding from sea level changes. Climate change or governmental initiatives to address climate change may affect our operations and necessitate capital expenditures in the future, although capital expenditures for climate-related projects are not expected to be material in fiscal 2024. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part I, Item 1 Business Environmental, Health and Safety and Other Regulatory Matters in our 2023 Form 10-K/A. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our business is subject to various types of market risks that include interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity pricing risk. Management has taken actions to mitigate our exposure to commodity pricing and foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into natural gas derivative instruments and foreign currency contracts. We may take further actions to mitigate our exposure to interest rates, exchange rates and changes in the cost of fuel consumed at our production locations or the cost of transporting our products due to variations in our contracted carriers cost of fuel, which is typically diesel fuel. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will eliminate or substantially reduce these risks. We do not enter into any financial instrument arrangements for speculative purposes. Our market risk exposure related to these items has not changed materially since September 30, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as amended (the Exchange Act) under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described below, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 Per Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 

 of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 
 
 In light of the material weaknesses described below, management performed additional analysis and other procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Accordingly, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 A material weakness, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 As disclosed in our amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The Company, due to a limited allocation of trained, knowledgeable resources, did not conduct an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of material misstatement, including fraud risks associated with the necessary approval of transactions. Additionally, the Company did not have an effective information and communication process that identified and assessed the source of and controls necessary to ensure the reliability of information used in financial reporting and that ensured complete, reliable information was made available to financial reporting personnel on a timely basis to fulfill their roles and responsibilities. As a consequence of the material weaknesses described above, internal control deficiencies related to the design and operation of process-level controls were determined to be ineffective throughout the Company s financial reporting processes. 
 
 Remediation Efforts and Status of Material Weakness 
 
 The Company is in the process of enhancing the design of certain internal controls over financial reporting related to accounting for significant changes in its business in accordance with a remediation plan for the material weaknesses described above. Management believes the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the material weaknesses described above. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to improve controls or determine to modify the remediation plan described above. These enhanced controls will be tested for effectiveness in future periods and the material weaknesses describe above cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than as discussed above, the Company has integrated Fortress operations, including integration of financial reporting processes and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in the legal proceedings described in Part I, Item 1, Note 7 and Part I, Item 1, Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements and, from time to time, various routine legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of our business. These primarily involve tax assessments, disputes with former employees and contract labor, commercial claims, product liability claims, personal injury claims and workers compensation claims. Management cannot predict the outcome of legal proceedings and claims with certainty. Nevertheless, management believes that the outcome of legal proceedings and claims, which are pending or known to be threatened, even if determined adversely, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, except as otherwise described in Part I, Item 1, Note 7 and Part I, Item 1, Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. There have been no material developments since September 30, 2023 with respect to our legal proceedings, except as described in Part I, Item 1, Note 7 and Part I, Item 1, Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE 
 
 We understand that to prevent employee and contractor injuries, we must approach safety excellence from many directions at once. We utilize a multi-faceted approach towards world class safety performance. This approach includes (1) setting a high standard of risk mitigation, (2) having robust safety management systems, and (3) supporting a culture of full engagement and personal accountability at all levels of the organization. 
 
 We continuously monitor our safety performance by assessing injury and non-injury incidents (e.g., near misses near hits) as well as key performance indicators. We believe our approach to safety excellence will help us deliver on our commitment to our employees, contractors, their families and our customers to provide a safe working environment. 
 
 Mine Safety Data 
 
 A subsidiary of Compass Minerals International, Inc. owns and operates the Cote Blanche mine, an underground salt mine located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. The Cote Blanche mine is subject to regulation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the Mine Act ). 
 
 MSHA is required to regularly inspect the Cote Blanche mine and issue a citation, or take other enforcement action, if an inspector or authorized representative believes that a violation of the Mine Act or MSHA s standards or regulations has occurred. MSHA is required to propose a civil penalty for each alleged violation that it cites. 
 
 We have the option to legally contest any enforcement action or related penalty we receive. As a result of this process, an enforcement action may be modified or vacated and any civil penalty proposed by MSHA for an alleged violation may be increased, reduced or eliminated. However, under the Mine Act, we are required to abate (or correct) each alleged violation within a specified time period, regardless of whether we contest the alleged violation. 

The table below sets forth information for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 concerning certain mine safety violations and other regulatory matters pursuant to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. The information only applies to our operations regulated by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration.
