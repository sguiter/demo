per warrant and expiration date of December 2024, and (iii) warrants with an exercise price of per warrant and expiration date in December 2026. 
 Derivative Warrants are considered derivative financial liabilities measured at fair value with all gains or losses recognized in profit or loss as the settlement amount for the Derivative Warrants may be adjusted during certain periods for variables that are not inputs to standard pricing models for forward or option equity contracts, i.e., the fixed for fixed criteria under ASC 815-40. The estimated fair value of the Derivative Warrants is measured at the end of each reporting period and an adjustment is reflected in fair value changes in derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). These are Level 3 recurring fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of the Derivative Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes model with stock price based on the OTCQX closing price of the Derivative Warrants issue date as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Effective income tax rate 
 The Company has computed its provision for income taxes based on the actual effective rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as the Company believes this is the best estimate for the annual effective tax rate. Therefore, the Company s effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not indicative of the effective income tax rate for each respective fiscal year of 2024 and 2023. The Company s effective income tax rate is significantly higher than the statutory income tax rates due in part to (i) an increase in the uncertain tax position liability due to tax positions based on legal interpretations that challenge the Company s tax liability under IRC Section 280E 280E ), (ii) interest and penalties accrual for tax liabilities, and (iii) state income taxes. 
 The IRS has taken the position that cannabis companies are subject to the limitation of 280E, a position held by state tax regulators in Nevada, Ohio and Virginia. Under the IRS s interpretation of 280E, cannabis companies are only allowed to deduct expenses directly and indirectly related to the production of inventory.

of uncertain tax position liabilities in the fourth quarter. 
 In connection with the preparation and filing of the fiscal 2022 income tax return, the Company changed its previous application of 280E to exclude certain parts of its business. In regards to fiscal years 2023 and 2024, the Company has taken the position that it does not owe taxes attributable to the application of 280E. However, since the Company s tax positions on 280E may be challenged by taxing authorities, the Company elected to treat the deductibility of these related expenses as an uncertain tax position. As of September 30, 2024, the balances in income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the tax position on 280E, which decreased current liabilities with a corresponding increase in non-current liabilities. There is no material impact to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 The Company has a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, inclusive of interest and penalties. The Company anticipates that it is reasonably possible that its new tax position on 280E may require changes to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. However, an estimate of such changes cannot reasonably be made. 
 The total amount of interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits recorded in income tax expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively.

 Company Overview 
 We are a vertically integrated, multi-state cannabis operator engaged in retail, distribution, cultivation, and processing operations in both medical and adult-use markets. We are focused on building a diverse portfolio of cannabis assets through opportunistic investments and pursuing application opportunities in attractive limited license jurisdictions and capitalizing on such assets through strategic deployment in our day-to-day operations. We have targeted assets in highly populated, limited license medical markets on a trajectory toward adult-use legalization, including Pennsylvania, markets that are in the process of transitioning to adult-use , namely Virginia, a nd limited license, fast-growing, large adult-use markets, such as Illinois, Nevada, Massachusetts and Ohio, and certain municipalities of California. 
 
 Factors Affecting our Performance and Related Trends 
 Competition and Pricing Pressure 
 The cannabis industry is subject to significant competition and pricing pressures, which is often market specific and can be caused by an oversupply of cannabis in the market, and may be transitory from period to period. We may experience significant competitive pricing pressures as well as competitive products and service providers in the markets in which we operate. Several significant competitors may offer products and/or services with prices that may match or are lower than ours. We believe that the products and services we offer are generally competitive with those offered by other cannabis companies. It is possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant research advantage over us that allows them to provide superior products or pricing, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Continued pricing pressure due to competition, increased cannabis supply or shifts in customer preferences could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure, resulting in a material impact on our results of operations, or asset impairments in future periods.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 (Amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated) 
 Revenue, Net 
 The following table presents revenue by type for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Retail 55,441 58,535 (3,094) (5) Wholesale 6,170 6,842 (672) (10) Total revenue, net 61,611 65,377 (3,766) (6) 
 Revenue, net, was 61,611 compared to 65,377, a decrease of 3,766 or 6 . 
 
 Retail revenue decreased 3,094 primarily due to: 
 A decline in sales in Illinois of 2,007 - the number of units sold decreased approximately 6 , and the average price per unit declined due to increased competition with competitors opening new stores in our markets; 
 A decline in sales in Pennsylvania of 1,538 and in Nevada of 961 - the number of units sold decreased approximately 2 in Pennsylvania and approximately 8 in Nevada, and t he average price per unit declined as we increased our use of promotions d ue to continued competition; and 
 A decline in sales in Massachusetts of 677 - while the number of units sold incre ased approximately 4 , t he average price per unit declined d ue to market price compression and continued competition. 
 These declines were partially offset by an increase in sales in Virginia of 1,430 primarily due to the opening of one new store in August 2023, and an increase in sales in Ohio of 1,130 due to the transition to adult-us e during the current quarter . The Company ende d the quarter with thirty-five ope rating dispensaries in seven states, as compared to thirty-four in seven states on September 30, 2023. 
 
 Wholesale revenue decreased 672. The decrease is primarily attributable to a 845 decline in wholesale revenue in Massachusetts and a 786 decline in Pennsylvania, due to continued competition and limited availability of products available to third parties through our wholesale channel as we prioritized supplying our retail stores. These decreases were partially offset by wholesale revenue growth in Virginia of 601 as the cultivation and processing facility in Virginia matured and had more product available for sale to third-parties. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 27,999 compared to 28,514, a decrease of 515 or 2 . Gross profit margin increased to 45 compared to 44 . The increase in gross profit margin was driven by continued efficiencies at our cultivation and processing facilities which have enabled us to reduce cost, partially offset by additional expenses in Ohio, including inventory write downs, as we ramp up our facilities in Ohio to support the transition to adult-use. In our retail channel, gross profit and gross profit margin declined due to competition which resulted in increased utilization of sales promotions. Jushi branded product sales as a percentage of total retail revenue were 55 across the Company s five vertical markets compared to 52 in the prior year. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were 27,819 compared to 25,688, an increase of 2,131 or 8 . The following table presents information on our operating expenses for the periods indicated:

 Salaries, wages and employee related expenses increased due to merit increase, as well as higher employee bonuses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to amortization of our business licenses which commenced during the second quarter of 2024, as we concluded that our business licenses no longer have indefinite useful lives . 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net was 9,382 compared to 9,345, an increase of 37, or 0 . 
 Fair Value gain (loss) on Derivatives 
 Fair value gain on derivatives was 2,628, compared to a loss of 7,460. Fair value gain (loss) on derivatives include the fair value changes relating to the derivative warrants. The derivative warrants are required to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting period. The fair value changes in derivatives were primarily attributable to the movement in our stock price during the corresponding period. 
 Other, Net 
 Other, net was an expense of 477, compared to an income of 1,368, a change of 1,845, which was primarily due to losses of 760 related to debt modifications in the current quarter, 667 lower foreign exchange translation adjustment mainly relating to certain Second Lien Notes denominated in Canadian dollars, and 563 lower indemnification asset gains related to acquisitions in the prior year. 
 
 Income Tax Expense

 Revenue, Net 
 The following table presents revenue by type for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Retail 169,802 180,461 (10,659) (6) Wholesale 21,863 21,214 649 3 Total revenue, net 191,665 201,675 (10,010) (5) 
 Revenue, net, was 191,665 compared to 201,675, a decrease of 10,010 or 5 . Retail revenue decreased 10,659 primarily due to: 
 A decline in sales in Illinois of 5,791 - while the number of units sold increased ap proximately 3 , the average price per unit declined as a result of pricing pressures due to the state of Missouri moving to recreational use, as well as increased competition with competitors opening new stores in our markets ; 
 A decline in sales in Massachusetts of 1,597 - while the number of units sold increased approx imately 4 , the average price per unit declined as we increased our use of promotions due to continued competition; and 
 A decline in sales in Nevada of 3,073 and in Pennsylvania of 5,743 - the number of units sold decreased by approximately 5 and 11 in Nevada and Pennsylvania, respectively, driven by increased competition. The decline in Nevada was also impacted by price compression, but the average price per unit remained stable in Pennsylvania. 
 
 These declines were partially offset by an increase in sales in Virginia of 5,300 primarily due to the opening of one new store in August 2023, and an increase in sales in Ohio of 1,102 due to the transition to adult-us e during the current year . 
 Wholesale revenue increased 649. The increase is primarily attributable to wholesale revenue growth in Virginia of 3,735 as the cultivation and processing facility in Virginia matured and had more product available for sale to third-parties. The growth in Virginia was partially offset by 1,295 decline in wholesale revenue in Nevada and 1,586 decline in Massachusetts due to continued competition and product availability to sell to third parties through our wholesale channel. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit was 92,895 compared to 89,009, an increase of 3,886 or 4 . Gross profit margin increased to 48 compared to 44 . The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was driven by efficiencies at our cultivation and processing facilities which have enabled us to reduce cost, partially offset by additional expenses in Ohio, including inventory write downs, as we ramp up our facilities in Ohio to support the transition to adult-use . In our retail channel, gross profit declined due to lower sales; however, gross profit margin improved 38 basis points as a result of increased sell-through of Jushi branded products at our retail stores. Jushi branded product sales as a percentage of total retail revenue were 55 across the Company s five vertical markets compared to 49 in the prior year. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were 80,192 compared to 85,294, a decrease of 5,102 or 6 . The following table presents information on our operating expenses for the periods indicated:

 (1) Other expenses are primarily comprised of marketing and selling expenses, insurance costs, administrative and application fees, software and technology costs, travel, gain/loss on lease terminations, gain/loss on asset disposals, entertainment and conferences and other. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the expansion of our retail operations which resulted in certain fixed assets being placed into service, as well as amortization of our business licenses which commenced during the second quarter of 2024, as we concluded that our business licenses no longer have indefinite useful lives . Lower share-based compensation expense reflects lower value of share-based compensation granted as well as forfeitures. Other expenses decreased primarily due to gains on the sale of certain non-core assets and operating lease terminations, and lower expenses relating to administrative fees and software and technology costs.

 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net was 27,997 compared to 27,655, an increase of 342, or 1 .

The derivative warrants are required to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting period. The fair value changes in derivatives were primarily attributable to the movement in our stock price during the corresponding period. 
 Other, Net 
 Other, net was an income of 4,186, compared to 1,887, a change of 2,299. The increase in income was primarily due to 1,896 gain on Jushi Europe deconsolidation. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Total income tax expense was 28,041 compared to 26,705 in the prior year, an increase of 1,336 or 5 . The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an increase in taxable income.

 Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliation 
 In addition to providing financial measurements based on GAAP, we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined below). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our operating business performance and allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. As there are no standardized methods of calculating these non-GAAP measures, our methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by others, thus limiting their usefulness. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), or earnings , before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before: (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense; (ii) inventory-related adjustments; (iii) fair value changes in derivatives; (iv) other (income)/expense items; (v) transaction costs; (vi) asset impairment; (vii) gain/loss on debt extinguishment; and (viii) start-up costs. These financial measures are metrics that have been adjusted from the GAAP net income (loss) measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Non- GAAP Measures) 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , was 10,345 and 9,710, respectively, resulting in an increase of 635 or 7 . 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , was 38,172 and 29,933, respectively, resulting in an increase of 8,239 or 28 . The increase in EBITDA was primarily due t o operating efficiencies at our grower processor facilities, lower payroll cost due to a decrease in the number of employees, and lower operating expenses relating to professional fees, administrative expenses, software and technology cost.

 Operating activities 
 Cash provided by operations was 14,415, as compared to cash used in operations of 7,827 . The change to cash provided by operating activities in the current year compared to cash used in operating activities in the prior year was primarily due to improved operating results , as well as an improvement in cash flow from working capital. 
 Investing activities 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash provided by investing activities was 189 compared to cash used in investing activities of 6,064. The current year includes 2,534 for the payments of property, plant and equipment for use in our operations, which was more than offset by 2,723 in proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. The prior year includes 8,385 for the payments of property, plant and equipment for use in our operations partially offset by 2,321 in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 23,018 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 17,214 . In July 2024, we refinanced our Acquisition Facility debt with proceeds from the issuance of Term Loans and cash on hand. R efer to Note 8 - Debt of our Quarterly Financial Statements contained in Part I. Item 1 of this report for more information. 
 The current year cash used in financing activities includes the following cash outflows: 
 2,750 in payments on promissory notes in the Debt Exchange, 
 3,600 in payments to extinguish one of our acquisition-related promissory note, 
 60,125 payments related to the Acquisition Facility debt which was extinguished in July 2024, 
 1,661 in net finance lease ob ligation payments, 
 2,357 in payments of loan financing costs, 
 1,409 in payments of other financing activities, and 
 270 in payments of mortgage-related debt. 
 The current year cash outflows used in financing activities were partially offset by: 
 47,530 of net proceeds from the issuance of Term Loans, 
 1,585 of proceeds from other financing activities, and 
 39 in issuance of options from exercise. 
 
 The prior year net cash flows provided by financing activities includes 21,900 in proceeds from mortgage loans and 3,295 in proceeds from other financing activities, partially offset by 2,761 in net finance lease obligation payments, 2,438 payments related to the Acquisition Facility debt, 2,372 in payments of other financing activities, 250 in payments of loan financing costs, and 160 in payments of mortgage-related debt. 
 Liquidity 
 As reflected in our 2023 Fo rm 10-K, we used net cash of 3,318 for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as of that date, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by 80,825. As of December 31, 2023 absent a refinancing, we would not meet our obligations within the next year and we believed that with a refinancing, we would meet our obligations. As a result, we concluded, as stated in the 2023 Form 10-K, that substantial doubt existed about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next twelve months from the date the 2023 financial statements were issued. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 14,415, and as of September 30, 2024, our c urrent assets exceeded our current liabilities b y 11,752 . Consistent with our conclusion as of June 30, 2024, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months, although we may choose to take advantage of opportunistic capital raising or refinancing transactions at any time. Depending on our future results of operations, we may need to engage in additional equity financing or other debt refinancing transactions in the longer term beyond twelve months, although there can be no assurances that such additional debt or equity financing may be obtained on favorable terms when required, if at all. 
 The Quarterly Financial Statements contained herein have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
