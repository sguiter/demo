Subscription 

Subscription
revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the product is made available
to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12 to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance
in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice. 

Post
Contract Support 

Revenue
from support services and product updates, referred to as subscription and support revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software
product updates and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. The Company s customers
purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, most customers renew their support
services contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice. 

Professional
Services 

Revenue
from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, data migration, training, or other consulting services.
Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation
to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes
revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services
are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies
judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external
factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement
changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are
typically due 30 days after invoice. 

BPO
and Internet Services 

Revenue
from BPO services is recognized based on the stage of completion which is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a
percentage of total estimated labor hours for each contract. Internet services are invoiced either monthly, quarterly, or half yearly
in advance to the customers and revenue is recognized ratably overtime on a monthly basis. 

Disaggregated
Revenue 

The
Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by category core and non-core, as it believes it best depicts how
the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Significant
Judgments 

Due
to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 for the Company s arrangements
may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances. 

Judgment
is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone
basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly
observable because the Company does not sell the license, product, or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information
that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes various factors, including
its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic
conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers. 

The
most significant inputs involved in the Company s revenue recognition policies are: The (1) stand-alone selling prices of the Company s
software license, and the (2) the method of recognizing revenue for installation/customization, and other services. 

The
stand-alone selling price of the licenses was measured primarily through an analysis of pricing that management evaluated when quoting
prices to customers. Although the Company has no history of selling its software separately from post contract support and other services,
the Company does have historical experience with amending contracts with customers to provide additional modules of its software or providing
those modules at an optional price. This information guides the Company in assessing the stand-alone selling price of the Company s
software, since the Company can observe instances where a customer had a particular component of the Company s software that was
essentially priced separate from other goods and services that the Company delivered to that customer. 

The
Company recognizes revenue from implementation and customization services using the percentage of estimated person-days that
the work requires. The Company believes the level of effort to complete the services is best measured by the amount of time (measured
as an employee working for one day on implementation/customization work) that is required to complete the implementation or customization
work. The Company reviews its estimate of person-days required to complete implementation and customization services each reporting period. 

Revenue
is recognized over time for the Company s subscription, post contract support and fixed fee professional services that are separate
performance obligations. For the Company s professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred
or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects.
A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and
testing requirement changes.

If
a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement,
such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment
to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single
arrangement. The Company s judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation
of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved. 

If
a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of consideration to which the entity
will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. When estimating variable consideration, the
Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price
only when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur. 

Contract
Balances 

The
timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables,
contract assets (revenues in excess of billings), or contract liabilities (unearned revenue) on the Company s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The Company records revenues in excess of billings when the Company has transferred goods or services but does not yet have the
right to consideration. The Company records unearned revenue when the Company has received or has the right to receive consideration
but has not yet transferred goods or services to the customer. 

The
revenues in excess of billings are transferred to receivables when the rights to consideration become unconditional, usually upon completion
of a milestone.

During

at the beginning of the period. All other activity in unearned revenue is due to the timing of invoicing in relation to the timing of
revenue recognition.

Revenue
allocated to the remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that
are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as
revenue in future periods. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately 
as of September 30, 2024, of which the Company estimates to recognize approximately 
in revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder over an estimated 3 years thereafter. Actual revenue recognition depends in
part on the timing of software modules installed at various customer sites. Accordingly, some factors that affect the
Company s revenue, such as the availability and demand for modules within customer geographic locations, is not entirely
within the Company s control. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the
Company has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of
invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Company s products and
services, and not to facilitate financing arrangements. 

Unearned
Revenue 

The
Company typically invoices its customers for subscription and support fees in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, with payment due
at the start of the subscription or support term. Unpaid invoice amounts for non-cancelable license and services starting in future periods
are included in accounts receivable and unearned revenue. 

Practical
Expedients and Exemptions 

There
are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and the Company s
disclosures. The Company has applied the following practical expedients: 

The
 Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is
 expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer. 

The
 Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the
 amortization period would have been one year or less or the commissions are based on cashed
 received. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated
 Statement of Operations. 

The
 Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts
 for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice
 for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements). 

Costs
to Obtain a Contract 

The
Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any balance sheet date. In general, the Company
incurs few direct incremental costs of obtaining new customer contracts. The Company rarely incurs incremental costs to review or otherwise
enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, the Company s sales personnel receive fees that are referred to
as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new customers. The Company s sales personnel are required to
perform additional duties beyond new customer contract inception dates, including fulfillment duties and collections efforts.

to years under leases classified
as financing and operating. For certain leases, the Company has options to extend the lease term for additional periods ranging from
 to years. 

The
Company treats a contract as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration, or the Company directs the use of the asset and obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset. These
leases are recorded as right-of-use ROU assets and lease obligation liabilities for leases with terms greater than 12
months. ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the entirety of the lease term. Lease liabilities
represent the Company s obligation to make payments over the life of the lease. A ROU asset and a lease liability are recognized
at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the life of the lease. Initial direct costs are included
as part of the ROU asset upon commencement of the lease. Since the interest rate implicit in a lease is generally not readily determinable
for the operating leases, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental
borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease
term to obtain an asset of similar value. 

The
Company reviews the impairment of ROU assets consistent with the approach applied to the Company s other long-lived assets.
The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the
carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the Company s ability to
recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related
operations. 

The
Company elected the practical expedient to exclude short-term leases (leases with original terms of 12 months or less) from ROU asset
and lease liability accounts. 

Lease
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. Variable
payments change due to facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and do not result
in a re-measurement of lease liabilities. The Company s variable lease payments include payments for finance leases that are adjusted
based on a change in the Karachi Inter Bank Offer Rate. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any significant residual
value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

Management
has identified the following material trends affecting NETSOL. 

Positive
trends: 

According
 to PR Newswire, December 14, 2023, and the S P Global Mobility, new vehicles sales globally are expected to reach 86 million
 units in 2023 for an 8.9 increase over 2022 and forecasts 2024 auto sales at 88.3 million units for a 2.8 increase over 2023. 

The
 U.S. automotive sales volumes are expected to reach approximately 15.9 million units, in 2024 sales, an estimated increase of 2 
 compared to 2023. (S P Global Mobility) 

The
 U.S. inflation rate decreased and ended at 2.4 at September 2024. (US Inflation Rate Trading Economics) 

The
 U.S. market remains strong and resilient for NETSOL to continue investing in building local teams for its core offerings. 

In
 2024, China domestic auto sales are expected to be at approximately 31 million units, a 3 increase from 2023. (China Passenger Car
 Association) 

In
 China, domestic electric vehicles sales are up 73 compared to August 2023. (Clean Technica 09/01/2024) 

The
 China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) investment, initiated by China, has exceeded 65 billion from the originally planned 46
 billion, in Pakistan energy and infrastructure sectors. Last June, China authorized a new 2.3 billion loan at a discounted rate
 to Pakistan as a short-term loan. 

The
 overall size of the mobility market in Europe and the United States is projected to increase over 425 billion combined, by 2035
 or a compound CAGR of 5 from 2022. (Deloitte Global Automotive Mobility Market Simulation Tool) 

The
 global automotive finance market accounted for 245 billion in 2022 and is expected to more than double by 2035 at a CAGR of 7.4 
 according to Precedence Research. 

The
 U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3 for the second quarter of 2024. This report reflects the U.S. economy to be resilient despite
 other pressures including inflation and higher interest rates. (Associated Press August 29, 2024) 

The
 Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a point in September 2024 and another half point reduction is forecasted by December 2024. 

The
 Russell index has returned an average of 14.4 during 2024. 

Negative
trends: 

The
 conflict in Gaza has disrupted the entire Middle East region since October 7, 2023. The conflict has expanded to neighboring nations
 such as Syria, Lebanon and Iran. The unrest and turmoil in the region is negative for the regional business environment. 

General
 economic conditions in our geographic markets; inflation, pending U.S. elections, geopolitical tensions, including trade wars, tariffs
 and/or sanctions in geographic areas; and global conflicts or disasters that impact the global economy or one or more sectors of
 the global economy. 

Political,
 monetary, and economic challenges and a higher inflation rate than other regional countries impacting Pakistan exports. 

Inflation
 and higher interest rates globally have greatly increased the cost of doing business, including salaries and benefits worldwide,
 affecting profitability. 

War
 and hostility between Russia and Ukraine continue to foster global economic uncertainty. 

The
 geo-political environment in South Asia will continue to influence Pakistan s economic prospects. Pakistan s political
 uncertainty has caused higher inflation with constant pressure on its currency being devalued against the US Dollar. According to
 a report issued by the World Bank, while marginal economic growth is expected in Pakistan, implementing an ambitious and credibly
 communicated economic reform plan is critical for a robust economic recovery. There is no guarantee that such reforms will be implemented.
 See Press Release, dated April 2, 2024, World Bank. 

While
 the US-China bilateral summit in January 2024 exceeded expectations, the tensions between the two countries continue. The US and
 EU have placed tariffs on a range of high-tech products from China including the US placing 100 tariffs on EV vehicles and 25 tariffs
 on EV batteries imported from China. (Center for Strategic and International Studies June 28, 2024).

A
significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We operate in several geographical regions
as described in Note 15 Operating Segments within the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Weakening
of the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of increasing our revenues but also
increasing our expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Similarly, strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to
foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our expenses denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar. We plan our business accordingly by deploying additional resources to areas of expansion, while continuing
to monitor our overall expenditures given the economic uncertainties of our target markets. In order to provide a framework for assessing
how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the changes in results from
one period to another period using constant currency. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current period
results to the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. In the table below, we present the change based on actual results in reported
currency and in constant currency.

months ended September 30, 2023. This represents an increase in loss of 1,110,787 with an increase in loss of 821,791 on a constant

Income and Expense 

Other
income was 1,207,684 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 62,329 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
This represents an increase of 1,145,355 with an increase of 1,095,873 on a constant currency basis. The increase is primarily due
to the foreign currency exchange transactions and interest income. The majority of the contracts with NetSol PK are either in U.S. dollars
or Euros; therefore, the currency fluctuations will lead to foreign currency exchange gains or losses depending on the value of the PKR
compared to the U.S. dollar and the Euro. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 542,545 in foreign
currency exchange transactions compared to a loss of 134,253 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months
ended September 30, 2024, the value of the U.S. dollar decreased 0.2 and the Euro increased 3.9 , compared to the PKR. During the three
months ended September 30, 2023, the value of the U.S. dollar increased 0.2 and the Euro decreased 2.6 , compared to the PKR. During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 769,867 compared to 414,718 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, for an increase of 355,149 and on constant currency basis an increase of 322,401. 

Non-controlling
Interest 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest was 146,914, compared to 260,173
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-controlling interest is primarily due to the increase in net loss
of NetSol Innovation. 

Net
income (loss) attributable to NetSol 

The
net income was 70,795 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 30,890 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
This is an increase in income of 39,905 with an increase of 153,796 on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. For the
three months ended September 30, 2024, net income per share was 0.006 for basic and diluted shares compared to net income per share

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

Regulation
S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use
of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share meet the definition
of a non-GAAP financial measure. 

We
define the non-GAAP measures as follows: 

EBITDA
 is GAAP net income or loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. 

Non-GAAP
 adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense. 

Adjusted
 EBITDA per basic and diluted share Adjusted EBITDA allocated to common stock divided by the weighted average shares outstanding
 and diluted shares outstanding. 

We
use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believe that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to
investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring
our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and
in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.
Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single
financial measure in evaluating the Company. 

The
non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: 

EBITDA :
We report EBITDA as a non-GAAP metric by excluding the effect of net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization
from net income or loss because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent. In addition,
we believe providing an EBITDA calculation is a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers. 

Stock-based
compensation expense : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP
adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with
current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense
which generally requires cash settlement by NetSol, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We
also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating
results of our peers. 

Non-controlling
interest : We add back the non-controlling interest in calculating gross adjusted EBITDA and then subtract out the income taxes, depreciation
and amortization and net interest expense attributable to the non-controlling interest to arrive at a net adjusted EBITDA.

reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share to the most comparable
GAAP measures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

various geographical regions of the world through our various subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries have financial arrangements from various
financial institutions to meet both their short and long-term funding requirements. These loans will become due at different maturity
dates as described in Note 12 of the financial statements. We are in compliance with the covenants of the financial arrangements and
there is no default, which may lead to early payment of these obligations. We anticipate paying back all these obligations on their respective
due dates from its own sources. 

We
typically fund the cash requirements for our operations in the U.S. through our license, services, and subscription and support agreements,
intercompany charges for corporate services, and through the exercise of options and warrants. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately
 24.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately 22.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.

million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 

We
remain open to strategic relationships that would provide value added benefits. The focus will remain on continuously improving cash
reserves internally and reduced reliance on external capital raise. 

As
a growing company, we have on-going capital expenditure needs based on our short term and long-term business plans. Although our requirements
for capital expenses vary from time to time, for the next 12 months, we anticipate needing 2.5 million for APAC, U.S. and Europe new
business development activities and infrastructure enhancements, which we expect to provide from current operations.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared applying certain critical accounting policies. The SEC defines critical
accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Critical accounting policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to
variations and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Changes in underlying
factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of
operations. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and they conform to general practices in our industry.
We apply critical accounting policies consistently from period to period and intend that any change in methodology occur in an appropriate
manner. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies and estimates as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
