million, for the 
first nine months 
of 2023, for 
which the Corporation 
recognized a net 
gain on sale 
 of 

million 
and 

million, 
respectively. 
Also, 
during 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024 
and 
2023, 
the 
Corporation 
sold 
 approximately 

million 
and 

million, 
respectively, 
of 
performing 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
to 
GSEs, 
for 
which 
the 
 Corporation 
recognized a 
net gain 
on sale 
of 

million and 

million, respectively. 
The Corporation s 
continuing involvement 
 with 
the 
loans 
that 
it 
sells 
consists 
primarily 
of 
servicing 
the 
loans. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Corporation 
agrees 
to 
repurchase 
loans 
if 
it 
 breaches any of 
the representations and 
warranties included in 
the sale agreement. 
These representations and 
warranties are consistent 
 with the 
GSEs selling 
and servicing 
guidelines i.e.
 , ensuring 
that the 
mortgage was 
properly underwritten 
according to 
established 
 guidelines).
 For loans 
pooled into 
GNMA MBS, 
the Corporation, 
as servicer, 
holds an 
option to 
repurchase individual 
delinquent loans 
issued 
 on or after 
January 1, 2003, 
when certain delinquency 
criteria are met. This 
option gives the 
Corporation the unilateral 
ability, 
but not 
 the obligation, to 
repurchase the delinquent 
loans at par without 
prior authorization from 
GNMA. Since the 
Corporation is considered 
 to 
have 
regained 
effective 
control 
over 
the 
loans, 
it 
is 
required 
to 
recognize 
the 
loans 
and 
a 
corresponding 
repurchase 
liability 
 regardless of its 
intent to repurchase 
the loans. As 
of September 
30, 2024 and 
December 31, 2023, 
rebooked GNMA delinquent 
loans 
 that were included in the residential mortgage loan portfolio amounted 
to 

million and 

million, respectively. 
 During 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024 
and 
2023, 
the 
Corporation 
repurchased, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
repurchase 
option, 

million and 

million, respectively, 
of loans previously pooled 
into GNMA MBS. The 
principal balance of these 
loans is fully 
 guaranteed, 
and the 
risk of 
loss related 
to the 
repurchased loans 
is generally 
limited to 
the difference 
between the 
delinquent interest 
 payment advanced 
to GNMA, which 
is computed at 
the loan s 
interest rate, 
and the interest 
payments reimbursed 
by FHA, which 
are 
 computed 
at a 
pre-determined 
debenture 
rate. 
Repurchases 
of GNMA 
loans allow 
the 
Corporation, 
among 
other 
things, to 
maintain 
 acceptable 
delinquency 
rates 
on 
outstanding 
GNMA 
pools 
and 
remain 
as 
a 
seller 
and 
servicer 
in 
good 
standing 
with 
GNMA. 
 Historically, losses 
on these repurchases of 
GNMA delinquent loans have 
been immaterial and no provision has 
been made at the time 
 of sale.
 Loan sales to FNMA and FHLMC are without recourse in relation 
to the future performance of the loans. 
The Corporation s risk of 
 loss 
with 
respect 
to 
these 
loans 
is 
also 
minimal 
as 
these 
repurchased 
loans 
are 
generally 
performing 
loans 
with 
documentation 
 deficiencies. 
 During 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
purchased 
commercial 
loan 
participations 
in 
the 
Florida 
region 
totaling 

million, which 
consisted of 
approximately 

million in 
the C I 
portfolio and 

million in 
the commercial 
mortgage 
 portfolio, compared 
to C I loan 
participations purchased 
in the Florida 
region totaling 

million during the 
same period of 
2023. 
 In addition, 
during 
the first 
nine months 
of 2024, 
the Corporation 
purchased 
commercial mortgage 
loan participations 
in the 
Puerto 
 Rico region totaling 

million.
 During 
the first 
nine months 
of 
2024, 
the Corporation 
recognized 
a 

million 
recovery 
associated 
with the 
bulk 
sale of 
fully

consumer 
loans. 
There 
were

a 
decrease 
of 

million, 
from 

million as 
of December 
31, 2023. 
The ACL 
for residential 
mortgage loans 
decreased by 

million, driven 
by the 
aforementioned 
 updated historical loss experience 
used for determining the ACL estimate resulting 
in a downward revision of 
estimated loss severities 
 and 
improvements 
in 
the 
long-term 
projections 
of 
the 
unemployment 
rate 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
region, 
partially 
offset 
by 
newly 
 originated loans. The ACL for commercial 
and construction loans decreased by 

million, mainly due to reserve releases 
associated 
 with the 
improved financial 
condition of 
certain borrowers 
and an 
improvement on 
the economic 
outlook of 
certain macroeconomic 
 variables, 
particularly 
variables 
associated 
with 
commercial 
real 
estate 
property 
performance 
and 
the 
forecasted 
CRE 
price 
index, 
 partially offset by increased volume. 

 Meanwhile, the 
ACL for 
consumer loans 
increased by 

million driven 
by higher 
charge-off 
levels and 
loan portfolio 
growth, 
 mainly in auto loans. 
 Net charge-offs 
were

million for the third 
quarter and first 
nine months of 
2024, respectively, 
compared to

million, respectively, 
for the 
same periods 
in 2023. 
The 

million increase 
in net 
charge-offs for 
the third 
 quarter of 
2024 was 
driven by 
an increase 
in consumer 
loans and 
finance leases 
charge-offs 
across all 
major portfolio 
classes, a 

million recovery recorded on a 
construction loan in the 
Puerto Rico region during the

million 
and 

million, respectively, 
compared to 

million and 

million, respectively, 
for the same periods of 2023. The decrease in income 
 tax expense 
for the 
third quarter 
of 2024 
was mainly 
due to 
lower pre-tax 
income and, 
to a 
lesser extent, 
a lower 
estimated effective 
 tax rate due 
to increased business 
activities with preferential 
tax treatment under 
the PR Tax 
Code and a 

million tax contingency 
 accrual release 
in connection with 
the expiration 
of the statute 
of limitation on 
some uncertain tax 
positions. Meanwhile, 
the decrease 
 in income 
tax expense 
for the first 
nine months 
of 2024 
was driven 
by a lower 
estimated effective 
tax rate due 
to the 
aforementioned 
 increased 
business 
activities 
with 
preferential 
tax 
treatment 
and, 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent, 
lower 
pre-tax 
income. 
The 
Corporation 
has 
 maintained 
an 
effective 
tax 
rate 
lower 
than 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
maximum 
statutory 
rate 
of 
 
 . 
The 
Corporation s 
estimated 
annual 
 effective tax 
rate, excluding 
entities with pre-tax 
losses from which 
a tax benefit 
cannot be recognized 
and discrete items, 
was 

for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 
 
 for the same period in 2023. 
 Income 
tax 
expense 
also 
includes 
USVI 
income 
taxes, 
as 
well 
as 
applicable 
U.S. 
federal 
and 
state 
taxes. 
As 
a 
Puerto 
Rico 
 corporation, FirstBank 
is treated as 
a foreign corporation 
for U.S. and 
USVI income tax 
purposes and is 
generally subject to 
U.S. and 
 USVI income 
tax only 
on its 
income from 
sources within 
the U.S. 
and USVI 
or income 
effectively 
connected with 
the conduct 
of a 
 trade or business in those jurisdictions. 
Such tax paid in the U.S. and USVI 
is also creditable against the Corporation s 
Puerto Rico tax 
 liability, 
subject 
to 
certain 
conditions 
and 
limitations. 
For 
the 
quarter 
and 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30,

current

of a 
valuation allowance 
of 
 
 million against 
the deferred

compared to 
a net 
deferred tax 
asset of 

million, net 
of a 
valuation allowance 
of 
 
 million, as of 
December 31, 2023. 
The net deferred 
tax asset of 
the Corporation s 
banking subsidiary, 
FirstBank, amounted 
to 
 
 million 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
net 
of 
a 
valuation 
allowance 
of

of 

million, 
net 
of 
a 
valuation 
allowance 
of 

million, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023. 
The 
decrease 
in 
the 
net 
deferred 
tax 
asset 
was 
 mainly related 
to the usage 
of alternative minimum 
tax credits and 
the decrease in 
the ACL. Meanwhile, 
the decrease in 
the valuation 
 allowance was related 
primarily to changes 
in the market 
value of available-for 
-sale debt securities 
which resulted 
in an equal 
change 
 in 
the 
net 
deferred 
tax 
asset 
without 
impacting 
earnings. 
The 
Corporation 
maintains 
a 
full 
valuation 
allowance 
for 
its 
deferred

Rico FirstBank 
or the

and 
FirstBank

Through 
its wholly 
-owned 
subsidiaries,

in 
Puerto 
Rico, 
the

States 
Virgin 
Islands USVI ),

 Recent Developments
 Economy and Market Update
 In light 
of the 
progress on 
inflation and 
a slower 
than expected 
growth in 
the labor 
market during 
August 2024, 
on September 
18, 
 2024 and November 11, 
2024, the Federal Reserve (the 
 FED decided to lower the target 
range for the federal funds rate by 
50 basis 
 points bps 
and 25 
bps, respectively. 
Nevertheless, 
recent 
indicators 
suggest that 
the U.S. 
economy 
has continued 
to expand 
at a 
 solid 
pace. 
Nonfarm 
payrolls for 
the month 
of September 
2024 
added 254,000 
jobs 
and 
the unemployment 
rate 
fell 
to 4.1 . 
Gross 
 Domestic 
Product GDP 
rose 
at 
a 
seasonally 
adjusted 
annual 
rate 
of 
2.8 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024, 
slightly 
below 
estimates 
 which were expecting a 3 growth. 
 The 
Corporation 
maintained 
positive 
credit 
performance 
and 
stable 
deposit 
trends 
and 
made 
good 
progress 
on 
its 
capital 
 deployment strategy. 
The U.S. and Puerto 
Rico economy remain on 
solid footing driven by 
positive labor market trends 
and increased 
 business activity. 
This environment 
continues to 
support credit 
demand and 
has enabled 
the Corporation 
to have 
its strongest 
quarter 
 of commercial 
loan originations 
for the 
year thus 
far. 
The Corporation 
remains focused 
on expanding 
existing relationships, 
building 
 loan pipeline, and adopting new platforms to enable future growth for the 
remainder of 2024 and for 2025. 
 The market expectations are for the FED to continue lowering rates and 
the federal funds rate is expected to be at 4.4 at the end of 
 this year and 
at 3.4 at 
the end of 
2025. The Corporation 
expects the net 
interest margin 
to remain flat 
for the fourth 
quarter of 
2024 
 but 
to 
improve 
for 
2025. 
The 
Corporation 
expects 
the 
downward 
repricing 
of 
the 
commercial 
variable-rate 
portfolio 
to 
be 
 compensated by 
the repricing 
of the 
cash flows 
from the 
lower yielding 
investment portfolio, 
the redeployment 
of cash 
inflows from 
 repayments of investment 
securities into loans or 
higher yielding securities, 
and the repricing 
of deposits. In 
addition, the replacement 
 of 
higher 
cost 
of 
funding 
such 
as 
brokered 
certificates 
of 
deposit CDs 
and 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
with 
lower 
cost 
of 
 funding is expected to improve the net interest margin as well. 
 Repurchase of Trust 
-Preferred Securities TruPS In September 
2024, 
the Corporation 
redeemed 50.0 
million, 
or 42 , 
of outstanding 
TruPS 
issued by 
FBP Statutory 
Trust 
II (or 
 48.5 million after excluding the Corporation s 
interest in the Trust of approximately 1.5 million) 
at a contractual call price of 100 . 
 The 
redemption 
was 
part 
of 
the 
repurchase 
program 
approved 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024 
under 
which 
the 
Corporation 
may 
 repurchase up to 
 250 million of 
common stock or 
junior subordinated 
debentures, which it 
expects to execute 
through the end 
of the 
 fourth 
quarter 
of 2025. 
As of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
has 
remaining 
authorization 
of approximately 
 250.0 
million 
in 
 combination with the remaining availability under the 2023 stock repurchase 
program.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES
 The 
accounting 
principles 
of 
the 
Corporation 
and 
the 
methods 
of 
applying 
these 
principles 
conform 
to 
GAAP. 
In 
preparing 
the 
 consolidated 
financial 
statements, 
management 
is 
required 
to 
make 
estimates, 
assumptions, 
and 
judgments 
that 
affect 
the 
amounts 
 recorded for assets, 
liabilities and contingent 
liabilities as of 
the date of 
the financial statements 
and the reported 
amounts of revenues 
 and 
expenses 
during 
the 
reporting 
periods.

including 
this 
MD A, 
describes 
the 
significant 
 accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements. 
 Not all significant 
accounting policies require 
management to make 
difficult, subjective 
or complex judgments. 
Critical accounting 
 estimates 
are 
those 
estimates 
made 
in 
accordance 
with 
GAAP 
that 
involve 
a 
significant 
level 
of 
uncertainty

likely 
to 
have 
a 
material 
impact

The 
Corporation s 
 critical accounting 
estimates that 
are particularly

 conditions prevail.
 Overview of Results of Operations 
 The 
Corporation s 
results 
of 
operations 
depend 
primarily 
on 
its 
net 
interest 
income, 
which 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
interest 
 income 
earned 
on 
its 
interest-earning 
assets, 
including 
investment 
securities 
and 
loans, 
and 
the 
interest 
expense 
incurred 
on 
its 
 interest-bearing 
liabilities, 
including 
deposits 
and 
borrowings. 
Net 
interest 
income 
is 
affected 
by 
various 
factors, 
including 
the 
 following: 
(i) 
the 
interest 
rate 
environment; 
(ii) 
the 
volumes, 
mix, 
and 
composition 
of 
interest-earning 
assets, 
and 
interest-bearing 
 liabilities; and 
(iii) the 
repricing 
characteristics of 
these assets 
and liabilities. 
The Corporation 
 s 
results of 
operations also 
depend on 
 the 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses, 
non-interest 
expenses 
(such 
as 
personnel, 
occupancy, 
professional 
service 
fees, 
the 
FDIC 
insurance 
 premium, 
and 
other 
costs), 
non-interest 
income 
(mainly 
service 
charges 
and 
fees 
on 
deposits, 
cards 
and 
processing 
income, 
and 
 insurance income), gains (losses) on mortgage banking activities, and income 
taxes. 
 For 
the 
quarter 
and 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
net 
income 
of 
 73.7

 diluted

and 
 223.0

 The

the 
Corporation s 
GAAP 
financial 
results 
for 
the 
quarter 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
compared 
to 
the 
third 
 quarter of 2023, include the following:
 
 Net 
interest 
income 
for 
the 
quarter 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
increased 
by 
 2.4 
million 
to 
 202.1 
million, 
compared 
to 
 199.7 million 
for the 
third quarter 
of 2023, 
driven 
by higher 
interest income 
on loans 
as a 
result of 
a change 
in asset 
mix 
 resulting from 
the deployment 
of cash 
flows from 
lower-yielding 
investment securities 
to fund 
loan growth, 
partially offset 
 by 
an 
increase 
in 
interest 
expense 
due 
to 
higher 
rates 
paid 
on 
interest-bearing 
deposits 
given 
the 
higher 
interest 
rate 
 environment and change in deposit mix. See Results of Operations Net Interest 
Income 
below for additional information. 
 
 The provision for credit 
losses on loans, finance 
leases, unfunded loan commitments 
and debt securities for the 
quarter ended 
 September 30, 
2024 was 15.2 
million, compared 
to 4.4 million 
for the third 
quarter of 2023 
. 
The increase in 
the provision 
 expense 
was driven 
by 
a 
 14.4 
million 
increase 
in 
the provision 
for 
the 
consumer 
loan 
and 
finance 
lease 
portfolios 
due to 
 higher charge-off levels. 
 Net charge-offs 
totaled 24.0 million 
for the quarter 
ended September 
30, 2024, or 
0.78 of average 
loans on an 
annualized 
 basis, compared 
to 14.1 million, 
or an annualized 
0.48 of average 
loans, for the 
third quarter of 
2023. The increase 
in net 
 charge-offs was mainly 
due to an increase in consumer 
loans and finance leases net charge 
-offs. See Results of 
Operations 
 Provision for 
Credit Losses 
and Risk 
Management below 
for analyses 
of the 
ACL and 
non-performing assets 
and related 
 ratios.
 
 Non-interest income for the quarter 
ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.2 
million, reflecting, among other things, 0.8 
 million 
in 
insurance 
proceeds 
received 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
revenues 
from 
mortgage 
banking 
 activities mainly due to a 0.8 
million increase in the net 
realized gain on sales of residential 
mortgage loans in the secondary 
 market. 
 
 Non-interest 
expenses 
for 
the 
quarter 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
increased 
by 
 6.3 
million 
to 
 122.9 
million, 
reflecting, 
 among other things, 
a 2.5 million increase 
in employees compensation 
and benefits expenses driven 
by annual salary 
merit 
 increases, 
a 1.5 million increase in professional 
services fees driven by information 
technology infrastructure enhancements,

information. 

Income tax expense decreased to 22.7 million for the third quarter 
of 2024, compared to 27.0 million for the same period in 
 2023, 
driven 
by 
lower 
pre-tax 
income 
and 
a 
lower 
estimated 
effective 
tax 
rate 
due 
to 
increased 
business 
activities 
with 
 preferential tax treatment 
under the PR Tax 
Code. The Corporation s 
estimated effective tax 
rate, excluding entities with 
pre-
 tax losses 
from which 
a tax benefit 
cannot be 
recognized and 
discrete items, 
decreased 
to 23.7 
for the 
first nine 
months of 
 2024, 
compared 
to 28.2

Corporation s 
total stockholders 
equity was 
 1.7 billion, 
an increase 
of 203.3 
million from 
 December 31,

a decrease

in the OREO 
portfolio balance 
in the Puerto 
Rico region, mainly 
attributable to the

and sales of residential OREO properties. This variance 
is net of 
 a 5.6 
million increase in 
total nonaccrual loans

to the inflow 
of a 16.5

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS 
 The Corporation has included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q 
the following financial measures that are not recognized under 
 GAAP, 
which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures: 

 Net Interest Income, 
Interest Rate Spread, 
and Net Interest Margin, Excluding 
Valuations 
, 
and on a Tax 
-Equivalent Basis 
 Net interest 
income, interest 
rate spread, 
and net 
interest margin 
are reported 
excluding the 
changes in 
the fair 
value of 
derivative 
 instruments and 
on a 
tax-equivalent basis 
in order 
to provide 
to investors 
additional information 
about the 
Corporation s 
net interest 
 income 
that management 
uses and 
believes should 
facilitate comparability and 
analysis of 
the periods 
presented. 
The changes 
in the 
 fair value 
of derivative 
instruments have 
no effect 
on interest 
due or 
interest earned 
on interest-bearing 
liabilities or 
interest-earning 
 assets, respectively. 
The tax-equivalent 
adjustment to 
net interest 
income recognizes 
the income 
tax savings 
when comparing 
taxable 
 and 
tax-exempt 
assets 
and 
assumes 
a 
marginal 
income 
tax 
rate. 
Income 
from 
tax-exempt 
earning 
assets 
is 
increased 
by 
an 
amount 
 equivalent to 
the taxes 
that would 
have been 
paid if 
this income 
had been 
taxable at 
statutory rates. 
Management believes 
that it 
is a 
 standard 
practice 
in 
the banking 
industry 
to 
present 
net 
interest 
income, 
interest 
rate 
spread, 
and 
net 
interest 
margin 
on 
a 
fully 
tax-
 equivalent basis. This adjustment 
puts all earning assets, most 
notably tax-exempt securities and 
tax-exempt loans, on a common 
basis 
 that facilitates comparison of results to the results of peers. 

 See Results of Operations Net Interest Income below, 
for the table that reconciles net interest income in accordance with GAAP 
 to 
the 
non-GAAP 
financial 
measure 
of 
net 
interest 
income, 
excluding 
valuations, 
and 
on 
a 
tax-equivalent 
basis 
for 
the 
indicated 
 periods. The table also reconciles 
net interest spread and 
net interest margin on 
a GAAP basis to these items 
excluding valuations, and 
 on a tax-equivalent basis. 
 Tangible 
Common Equity Ratio and Tangible 
Book Value 
Per Common Share 
 The tangible 
common equity 
ratio and 
tangible book 
value per 
common share 
are non-GAAP 
financial measures 
that management 
 believes are generally 
used by the financial 
community to evaluate 
capital adequacy. 
Tangible 
common equity is total 
common equity 
 less goodwill 
and 
other 
intangibles. Similarly, 
tangible 
assets are 
total assets 
less goodwill 
and 
other 
intangibles. 
Tangible 
common 
 equity ratio is tangible common 
equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible 
book value per common share is 
tangible assets divided by 
 the number 
of common 
shares outstanding. 
Management uses 
and believes 
that many 
stock analysts 
use the 
tangible common 
equity 
 ratio and 
tangible book 
value per 
common share 
in conjunction 
with other 
more traditional 
bank capital 
ratios to 
compare the 
capital 
 adequacy of banking organizations 
with significant amounts of 
goodwill or other intangible 
assets, typically stemming from 
the use of 
 the 
purchase 
method 
of 
accounting 
for 
mergers 
and 
acquisitions. 
Accordingly, 
the 
Corporation 
believes 
that 
disclosures 
of 
these 
 financial measures 
may be useful 
to investors. Neither 
tangible common equity 
nor tangible assets, 
or the related 
measures, should be 
 considered 
in 
isolation 
or 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
stockholders 
equity, 
total 
assets, 
or 
any 
other 
measure 
calculated 
in 
accordance 
with 
 GAAP. 
Moreover, 
the manner 
in which 
the Corporation 
calculates its 
tangible common 
equity, 
tangible assets, 
and any 
other related 
 measures may differ from that of other companies reporting 
measures with similar names. 
 See Risk 
Management 
Capital below 
for the 
table that 
reconciles the 
Corporation s 
total equity 
and total 
assets in 
accordance 
 with GAAP to 
the tangible common 
equity and tangible 
assets figures used 
to calculate the 
non-GAAP financial measures 
of tangible 
 common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share.

 Adjusted Net Income, 
Adjusted Non-Interest Income, and Adjusted Non-Interest 
Expenses 
 To 
supplement the 
Corporation s 
financial statements 
presented in 
accordance with 
GAAP, 
the Corporation 
uses, and believes 
that 
 investors 
benefit 
from 
disclosure 
of, 
non-GAAP 
financial 
measures 
that 
reflect 
adjustments 
to 
net 
income, 
non-interest 
income 
and 
 non-interest expenses 
to exclude 
items that 
management believes 
are not 
reflective of 
core operating 
performance Special 
Items ). 
 The financial 
results for the 
quarters ended 
September 30, 2024 
and 2023 did 
not include any 
significant Special 
Items. The financial 
 results for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 
and 2023 included the following Special Items: 
 Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 -
 Charges of 1.1 million 0.7 million after-tax, 
calculated based on the statutory tax rate of 37.5 were recorded in the nine-
 month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
respectively, 
to 
increase 
the 
initial 
estimated 
FDIC 
special 
assessment 
resulting 
 from the FDIC s 
updates related to 
the loss estimate 
in connection with 
losses to the 
Deposit Insurance Fund 
associated with 
 protecting 
uninsured 
deposits 
following 
the 
failures 
of 
certain 
financial 
institutions 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2023. 
The 
 aforementioned 
charges 
increased 
the 
estimated 
FDIC 
special 
assessment 
to 
a 
total 
of 
 7.4 
million, 
which 
was the 
revised 
 estimated loss 
reflected 
in the 
FDIC invoice 
for 
the first 
quarterly 
collection period 
with a 
payment 
date of 
June 28, 
2024. 
 The 
FDIC 
special 
assessment 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
income 
as 
part 
of 
 FDIC 
deposit 
insurance 
 expenses. 
 Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023 
 -
 A 
 3.6 
million 2.3 
million 
after-tax, 
calculated 
based 
on 
the 
statutory 
tax 
rate 
of 
37.5 
gain 
recognized 
from 
a 
legal 
 settlement reflected in the consolidated statements of income as part of 
 other non-interest income. 
 -
 A 
 1.6 
million 
gain 
on 
the 
repurchase 
of 
 21.4 
million 
in 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
reflected 
in 
the 
consolidated 
 statements 
of 
income 
as 
 Gain 
on 
early 
extinguishment 
of 
debt. 
The 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
 consolidated statements 
of financial condition 
as Other long-term 
borrowings. The 
purchase price 
equated to 
92.5 of the 
 21.4 
million 
par 
value 
of 
the 
trust 
preferred 
securities. 
The 
7.5 
discount 
resulted 
in 
the 
gain 
of 
 1.6 
million. 
The gain, 
 realized at the holding company level, had no effect on 
the income tax expense in 2023.

 RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest 
income is 
the excess of 
interest earned 
by First 
BanCorp. on 
its interest-earning 
assets over 
the interest 
incurred on its 
 interest-bearing 
liabilities. 
First 
BanCorp. s 
net 
interest 
income 
is 
subject 
to 
interest 
rate 
risk 
due 
to 
the 
repricing 
and 
maturity 
 mismatch 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
assets 
and 
liabilities. 
In 
addition, 
variable 
sources 
of 
interest 
income, 
such 
as 
loan 
fees, 
periodic 
 dividends, and 
collection of 
interest in 
nonaccrual loans, 
can fluctuate 
from period 
to period. 
Net interest 
income for 
the quarter 
and 
 nine-month 
period ended 
September 30, 
2024 was 
 202.1 million 
and 598.2 
million, respectively, 
compared to 
 199.7 million 
and 
 600.4 million for 
the comparable periods 
in 2023, respectively. 
On a tax-equivalent 
basis and excluding 
the changes in the 
fair value 
 of derivative instruments, net interest income for the quarter and 
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 206.6 million 
and 
 612.4 million, respectively, 
compared to 204.4 million and 617.0 million for the comparable periods in 2023, 
respectively.
 The 
following 
tables 
include a 
detailed 
analysis 
of net 
interest income 
for 
the indicated 
periods. 
Part I 
presents 
average volumes 
 (based 
on 
the 
average 
daily 
balance) 
and 
rates 
on 
an 
adjusted 
tax-equivalent 
basis 
and 
Part 
II 
presents, 
also 
on 
an 
adjusted 
tax-
 equivalent basis, 
the extent 
to which 
changes in 
interest rates 
and changes 
in the 
volume of 
interest-related assets 
and liabilities 
have 
 affected 
the Corporation s 
net interest 
income. For 
each category 
of interest-earning 
assets and 
interest-bearing 
liabilities, the 
tables 
 provide 
information 
on 
changes 
in 
(i) 
volume 
(changes 
in 
volume 
multiplied 
by 
prior 
period 
rates), 
and 
(ii) 
rate 
(changes 
in 
rate 
 multiplied by 
prior period 
volumes). The 
Corporation has 
allocated rate-volume 
variances (changes 
in rate 
multiplied by 
changes in 
 volume) to either the changes in volume or the changes in rate based upon the 
effect of each factor on the combined totals.
 Net interest 
income on 
an adjusted 
tax-equivalent 
basis and 
excluding 
the changes 
in the 
fair value 
of derivative 
instruments is 
a 
 non-GAAP 
financial 
measure. 
For 
the 
definition 
of 
this 
non-GAAP 
financial 
measure,

 (1) 
 On an adjusted tax-equivalent 
basis. The Corporation 
estimated the adjusted 
tax-equivalent yield by dividing 
the interest rate spread 
on exempt assets by 
1 less the Puerto Rico 
statutory tax 
 rate 
of 37.5 
and 
adding 
to 
it the 
cost 
of interest-bearing 
liabilities. 
The 
tax-equivalent 
adjustment 
recognizes 
the 
income 
tax savings 
when comparing 
taxable 
and 
tax-exempt 
assets. 
 Management believes that it is a standard practice 
in the banking industry to present net interest income, 
interest rate spread and net interest margin 
on a fully tax-equivalent basis. Therefore, 
 management believes these 
measures provide useful information 
to investors by allowing 
them to make peer 
comparisons. The Corporation 
excludes changes in 
the fair value of 
derivatives 
 from interest income because the changes in valuation do not affect 
interest received. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
and Reconciliations" above.

 Portions of the Corporation s 
interest-earning assets, mostly investments 
in obligations of some U.S. 
government agencies and U.S. 
 government-sponsored 
entities GSEs ), 
generate interest 
that is 
exempt from 
income tax, 
principally in 
Puerto Rico. 
Also, interest 
 and gains 
on sales of 
investments held by 
the Corporation s 
international banking 
entities IBEs are 
tax-exempt under 
Puerto Rico 
 tax 
law 
(see 
Note 
16 
 
 Income 
Taxes 
to 
the 
unaudited 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
herein 
for 
additional 
information). 
 Management 
believes 
that 
the 
presentation 
of 
interest 
income 
on 
an 
adjusted 
tax-equivalent 
basis 
facilitates 
the 
comparison 
of 
all 
 interest data 
related to 
these assets. The 
Corporation estimated 
the tax 
equivalent yield 
by dividing 
the interest 
rate spread 
on exempt 
 assets 
by 
1 
less 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
statutory 
tax 
rate 
(37.5 
and 
adding 
to 
it 
the 
average 
cost 
of 
interest-bearing 
liabilities. 
The 
 computation considers the interest expense disallowance required 
by Puerto Rico tax law. 

 Management 
believes 
that 
the 
presentation 
of 
net 
interest 
income, 
excluding 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
 derivative 
instruments valuations ), 
provides 
additional 
information 
about 
the 
Corporation s 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
facilitates 
 comparability and analysis from 
period to period. The changes 
in the fair value of 
the derivative instruments have 
no effect on interest 
 earned on interest-earning assets.

 Net 
interest 
income 
amounted 
to 
 202.1 
million 
for 
the 
quarter 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
an 
increase 
of 
 2.4 
million, 
when 
 compared to 199.7 million for the same period in 2023. The 2.4 
million increase in net interest income was primarily due to: 
 
 A 15.8 million increase in interest income on loans, 
including: 
 -
 An 
 8.3 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
income 
on 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans, 
driven 
by 
a 
 6.6 
million 
increase 
 associated 
with 
a 
 366.3 
million 
increase 
in 
the 
average 
balance, 
and 
a 
 2.9 
million 
increase 
related 
to 
the 
effect 
of 
 higher market interest 
rates on the upward 
repricing of variable-rate 
loans and on new 
loan originations. These 
variances 
 were partially 
offset by 
interest income of 
 1.2 million 
recognized in 
the third quarter 
of 2023 
due to the 
collection of a 
 previously charged-off construction loan in the 
Puerto Rico region. 
 As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
interest 
rate 
on 
approximately 
54 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
commercial 
and 
construction 
 loans was tied 
to variable 
rates, with 33 
based upon 
SOFR of 3 
months or 
less, 12 based 
upon the 
Prime rate index, 
 and 9 based on other indexes. 
 -
 A 
 5.6 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
income 
on 
consumer 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases, 
primarily 
associated 
with 
a 
 189.3 
 million increase in the average balance of this portfolio, mainly auto 
loans and finance leases. 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 An 8.9 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, including 
: 
 -
 A 7.9 million 
increase in interest expense 
on time deposits, 
excluding brokered CDs, 
of which 5.1 
million was related 
 to higher rates on renewals, associated with the overall higher interest rate 
environment, 
and 2.8 million was driven by a 
 349.6 million 
increase in the 
average balance. The 
average cost of 
time deposits in 
the third quarter 
of 2024, excluding 
 brokered CDs, increased 69 bps to 3.60 when compared to the same period 
in 2023. 
 -
 A 3.8 million increase in interest expense on brokered CDs, driven by 
a 281.5 million increase in the average balance. 
 Partially offset by: 
 -
 A 2.3 million decrease 
in interest expense on interest-bearing 
checking and saving accounts, 
driven by a 527.7 
million 
 decrease in the average balance. 

A 4.5 
million 
decrease 
in interest 
income 
from 
total investments, 
consisting 
of 
a 2.4 
million 
decrease 
in interest 
income 
 from debt securities, 
mainly associated with 
a 657.7 million 
decrease in the 
average balance, 
and a 2.1 
million decrease in 
 interest income from interest-bearing cash balances, 
primarily cash balances deposited at the FED, driven 
by a 162.5 million 
 decrease in the average balance. 
 Net interest 
margin 
for the 
third quarter 
of 2024 
was 4.25 , 
compared to 
4.15 for 
the same 
period in 
2023. The 
increase in 
the 
 net interest 
margin was 
driven by 
a change 
in asset 
mix resulting 
from the 
deployment of 
cash flows 
from lower-yielding 
investment 
 securities to 
fund loan 
growth as well 
as the 
effect of 
the higher 
interest rate 
environment on 
commercial and 
consumer loans 
yields. 
 These variances were 
partially offset by 
the higher cost of 
funds associated with 
the higher interest 
rate environment combined 
with a 
 change in deposit mix reflecting a continued migration from non-interest-bearing and other 
low-cost deposits to higher-cost deposits. 

88
 Net interest 
income amounted 
to 598.2 
million for 
the nine-month 
period ended 
September 30, 
2024, a 
decrease of 
 2.2 million, 
 when compared to 600.4 million for same period in 2023. The 2.2 million 
decrease in net interest income was primarily due to: 
 
 A 59.6 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting 
of: 
 -
 A 
 32.5 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
expense 
on 
time 
deposits, 
excluding 
brokered 
CDs, 
of 
which 
 22.9 
million 
was 
 related 
to higher 
rates in 
the first 
nine 
months of 
2024 on 
new issuances 
and renewals 
, 
also associated 
with the 
higher 
 interest rate environment 
, 
and 9.6 million 
was driven 
by a 462.4 
million increase 
in the average 
balance. The 
average 
 cost of time deposits for the first nine months of 2024, 
excluding brokered CDs, increased 107 bps to 3.52 as compared 
 to 2.45 for the same period in 2023. 
 -
 A 
 16.7 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
expense 
on 
brokered 
CDs, 
driven 
by 
a 
 401.6 
million 
increase 
in 
the 
average 
 balance. 
 -
 A 15.4 million 
increase in interest expense 
on interest-bearing checking 
and saving accounts, 
also related to 
the overall 
 higher interest 
rate environment. The 
average cost of 
interest-bearing checking 
and saving accounts 
increased by 
30 bps 
 to 
1.52 
for 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024 
as 
compared 
to 
1.22 
for 
the 
same 
period 
in 
2023, 
mostly 
driven 
by 
 government 
deposits 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
region. 
Excluding 
government 
deposits, 
the 
average 
cost 
of 
interest-bearing 
 checking and 
savings accounts 
for the 
first nine 
months of 
2024 was 
0.75 , compared 
to 0.69 
for the 
same period 
in 
 2023. 
 Partially offset by: 
 -
 A 
 5.0 
million 
decrease 
in 
interest 
expense 
on 
borrowings, 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
 2.8 
million 
decrease 
on 
short-term 
 repurchase agreements 
since they were 
not used as 
a funding source 
in the first 
nine months of 
2024, and a 
 2.0 million 
 decrease on advances from the FHLB, mainly associated with a 54.0 
million decrease in the average balance. 
 
 A 
 6.7 
million 
decrease 
in 
interest 
income 
from 
total 
investments, 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
 9.0 
million 
net 
decrease 
in 
interest 
 income 
from 
debt securities, 
mainly 
associated with 
a 660.7 
million 
decrease 
in the 
average 
balance, 
partially 
offset 
by a 
 1.6 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
income 
from 
interest-bearing 
cash 
balances, 
which 
consisted 
primarily 
of 
cash 
balances 
 deposited at the FED, due to the effect of higher market interest rates. 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 A 64.1 
million increase in interest income on loans, 
including: 
 -
 A 35.1 
million 
increase 
in 
interest income 
on 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans, 
driven 
by 
a 
 23.1 
million 
increase 
 associated 
with 
a 
 402.7 
million 
increase 
in 
the 
average 
balance, 
and 
a 
 12.0 
million 
increase 
related 
to 
the 
effect 
of 
 higher market interest rates on the upward repricing of variable-rate 
loans and on new loan originations. 
 -
 A 
 25.6 
million 
increase 
in 
interest 
income 
on 
consumer 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases, 
primarily 
due 
to 
a 
 246.8 
million 
 increase in the average balance of this portfolio, mainly auto loans and finance 
leases. 
 Net 
interest 
margin 
for 
the nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
was 4.21 , 
compared 
to 4.24 
for 
the same 
period 
in 
 2023. 
The 
decrease 
in 
the 
net 
interest 
margin 
was 
driven 
by 
the 
higher 
cost 
of 
funds 
associated 
with 
the 
higher 
interest 
rate 
 environment 
combined 
with 
a 
change 
in 
deposit 
mix 
reflecting 
a 
continued 
migration 
from 
non-interest-bearing 
and other 
low-cost 
 deposits to higher-cost 
deposits, 
as well as the 
increase in balance 
of brokered CDs. 
These variances were 
partially offset by 
a change 
 in asset mix resulting 
from the deployment 
of cash flows from 
lower-yielding investment securities 
to fund loan growth 
as well as the 
 effect of the higher interest rate environment on commercial and 
consumer loans yields.

 Provision for Credit Losses
 The provision 
for credit 
losses consists of 
provisions for 
credit losses on 
loans and 
finance leases, 
unfunded loan 
commitments, as 
 well as the debt securities portfolio. The principal changes in the provision 
for credit losses by main categories follow: 
 Provision for credit losses for 
loans and finance leases 
 The 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
for 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
was 
 16.5 
million 
for 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024, 
compared 
to 
 10.6 
 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
The variances by major portfolio category were as follows: 
 
 Provision for 
credit losses 
for the 
consumer 
loan and 
finance lease 
portfolios 
was an 
expense of 
 28.4 million 
for the 
third 
 quarter of 2024, compared to an expense of 14.0 million for the third 
quarter of 2023. The increase in provision expense was 
 driven by higher charge-off levels in these 
portfolios. 
 
 Provision for 
credit losses 
for the 
commercial and 
construction loan 
portfolios 
was a net 
benefit of 
 6.4 million 
for the third 
 quarter of 
2024, compared 
to a 
net benefit 
of 0.1 
million for 
the third 
quarter of 
2023. The 
net benefit 
recorded during 
the 
 third 
quarter 
of 
2024 
was 
associated 
with 
the 
improved 
financial 
condition 
of certain 
borrowers 
and, 
to 
a 
lesser extent, 
an 
 improvement on the economic outlook of certain macroeconomic 
variables, particularly variables associated with commercial 
 real estate property performance and the forecasted commercial real 
estate CRE price index. 

Provision for credit 
losses for the residential 
mortgage loan portfolio 
was a net benefit 
of 5.5 million for 
the third quarter of 
 2024, compared to a net 
benefit of 3.3 million for the 
third quarter of 2023. The net benefit 
recorded during the third quarter 
 of 2024 was driven 
by a higher benefit 
associated with updated 
macroeconomic variables, mainly 
in the long-term projection 
 of the unemployment rate in the Puerto Rico region. 

 The provision 
for credit losses 
for loans 
and finance leases 
was 41.3 
million for the 
first nine months 
of 2024, compared 
to 47.7 
 million for the same period of 2023. The variances by major portfolio 
category were as follows: 
 
 Provision for 
credit losses for 
the commercial 
and construction 
loan portfolios was 
a net benefit 
of 13.4 million 
for the first 
 nine months of 
2024, compared 
to an expense 
of 10.6 million 
for the same 
period of 2023. 
The net benefit 
recorded during 
 the first nine months of 2024 was driven by the 
aforementioned improved financial condition of certain 
borrowers, a recovery 
 of 5.0 million associated 
with a C I loan 
in the Puerto Rico 
region, and 1.2 million 
in recoveries of two 
commercial loans 
 in the 
Florida region, 
partially offset 
by increased 
volume. Meanwhile, 
the expense 
recorded during 
the first 
nine months 
of 
 2023 was mainly due 
to a deterioration in the 
forecasted CRE price index, 
a 6.2 million charge 
associated with a nonaccrual 
 participated 
C I 
loan 
in 
the Florida 
region 
associated 
with 
the 
power 
generation 
industry, 
the aforementioned 
incremental 
 reserve associated 
with the 
inflow to 
nonaccrual status 
of a 
 9.5 million 
C I loan 
in the 
Puerto Rico 
region and, 
to a 
lesser 
 extent, portfolio growth. 
 
 Provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
for 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
portfolio 
was 
a 
net 
benefit 
of 
 16.6 
million 
for 
the 
first 
nine 
 months of 
2024, compared 
to a net 
benefit of 
 6.8 million 
for the 
same period 
of 2023. 
The increase 
in net 
benefit recorded 
 during the first 
nine months of 2024 
was driven by updated 
historical loss experience 
used for determining 
the ACL estimate 
 resulting in a 
downward revision of 
estimated loss severities 
and lower required 
reserve levels as further 
explained in Note 
3 
 
 Loans 
Held 
for 
Investment 
to 
the 
unaudited 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
herein, 
and 
the 
aforementioned 
updated 
 macroeconomic variables, partially offset by newly originated 
loans. 
 
 Provision 
for 
credit losses 
for 
the consumer 
loan 
and 
finance lease 
portfolios 
was an 
expense 
of 71.3 
million 
for 
the first 
 nine 
months 
of 
2024, 
compared 
to 
an 
expense 
of 
 43.9 
million 
for 
the 
same 
period 
of 
2023. 
The 
increase 
in 
provision 
 expense 
was driven 
by 
higher charge 
-off 
levels in 
these 
portfolios 
and 
increases 
in 
portfolio 
volumes, 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 10.0 million recovery associated with the bulk sale of fully charged 
-off loans recorded during the first nine months of 2024. 

90
 
Provision for credit losses for 
unfunded loan commitments 
 The 
provision 
for 
credit losses 
for 
unfunded 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loan 
commitments and 
standby 
letters of 
credit for 
the 
 third 
quarter 
and 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024 
was 
a 
net 
benefit 
of 
 1.0 
million 
and 
 1.1 
million, 
respectively, 
compared 
to 
a 
net 
 benefit of 0.1 
million and an expense 
of 0.5 million, 
for the same periods 
in 2023, respectively. 
The net benefit 
recorded during the 
 third 
quarter 
and 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024 
was 
driven 
by 
an 
improvement 
on 
the 
economic 
outlook 
of 
certain 
macroeconomic 
 variables, particularly in variables associated with the CRE price 
index. 
 
Provision for credit losses for 
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities
 The provision for credit losses 
for held-to-maturity debt securities was 
a net benefit of 0.1 million 
and a net benefit of 1.1 
million 
 for 
the 
third 
quarter 
and 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024, 
respectively, 
compared 
to 
a 
net 
benefit 
of 
 6.2 
million 
and 
 6.0 
million, 
 respectively, 
for the same 
periods in 2023. 
The net benefit 
recorded during 
the third quarter 
and first nine 
months of 2023 
was driven 
 by the refinancing 
of a 46.5 million 
municipal bond into 
a shorter-term commercial 
loan structure and, 
to a lesser extent, 
a reduction 
 in qualitative reserves driven by updated financial information of certain 
bond issuers received during the third quarter of 2023. 
 The 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses for 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities for 
the third 
quarter 
and 
first 
nine 
months 
of 2024 
was a 
net 
 benefit 
of 36 
thousand 
and a 
net benefit 
of 45 
thousand, respectively, 
compared to 
an expense 
of 32 
thousand 
and 7 
thousand, 
 respectively, for the 
same periods in 2023. 

91
 Non-Interest Income 
 Non-interest 
income 
amounted 
to 
 32.5 
million 
for 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024, 
compared 
to 
 30.3 
million 
for 
the 
same 
period 
in 
 2023. 
The 2.2 million increase in non-interest income was primarily due to: 
 
 A 0.9 million increase in card and processing income, 
mainly in merchant-related fees and interchange income 
due to higher 
 transactional volumes. 
 
 A 
 0.6 
million 
increase 
in 
other 
non-interest 
income, 
driven 
by 
 0.8 
million 
in 
insurance 
proceeds 
received 
in 
the 
third 
 quarter of 2024 related to a 2020 outstanding insurance claim. 
 
 A 0.4 
million 
increase 
in revenues 
from mortgage 
banking activities, 
driven 
by a 
 0.8 million 
increase 
in the 
net realized 
 gain on 
sales of 
residential mortgage 
loans in 
the secondary 
market 
due to 
higher margins, 
partially offset 
by a 
 0.3 million 
 decrease 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
to-be-announced TBA 
forward 
contracts. 
During 
the 
third 
quarters 
of 2024 
and 
2023, 
net 
 realized gains of 1.7 million and 
 0.9 million, respectively, 
were recognized as a result of GNMA 
securitization transactions 
 and whole loan sales to U.S. GSEs amounting to 38.2 million and 42.3 
million, respectively. 
 Non-interest 
income for 
the nine-month 
period ended 
September 30, 
2024 amounted 
to 98.5 
million, compared 
to 99.1 
million 
 for the same period 
in 2023. Non-interest income 
for the nine-month period 
ended September 30, 2023 
included the following Special 
 Items: the 
 3.6 million 
gain recognized 
from a 
legal settlement, 
included as 
part of 
 other non-interest 
income, and 
the 1.6 
million 
 gain 
on 
the 
repurchase 
of 
 21.4 
million 
in 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures, 
reported 
as 
 gain 
on 
early 
extinguishment 
of 
debt. 
See 
 Non-GAAP Financial 
Measures and 
Reconciliations above 
for additional 
information. On 
a non-GAAP 
basis, excluding 
the effect 
 of these Special Items, adjusted non-interest income increased by 4.6 
million primarily due to: 
 
 A 
 1.7 
million 
increase 
in 
card 
and 
processing 
income, 
mainly 
in 
merchant-related 
fees 
and 
interchange 
income 
due 
to 
 higher transactional volumes. 
 
 A 1.0 million 
increase in revenues 
from mortgage banking 
activities, driven by 
a 1.4 million increase 
in the net 
realized 
 gain on sales 
of residential mortgage 
loans in the secondary 
market due to 
higher margins. During 
the first nine months 
of 
 2024 
and 
2023, 
net 
realized gains 
of 4.3 
million 
and 
 2.9 
million, 
respectively, 
were recognized 
as a 
result of 
GNMA 
 securitization 
transactions 
and 
whole 
loan 
sales 
to 
U.S. 
GSEs 
amounting 
to 
 113.2 
million 
and 
 131.5 
million, 
 respectively. 
 
 A 0.9 million increase in insurance commission income, 
mainly related to higher contingent commissions. 
 
 The 
aforementioned 
 0.8 
million 
in 
insurance 
proceeds 
received 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 2024, 
included 
as 
part of 
 other 
 non-interest income. 

92
 Non-Interest Expenses 
 Non-interest 
expenses for 
the quarter 
ended September 
30, 2024 
amounted to 
 122.9 million, 
compared to 
 116.6 
million for 
the 
 same period in 2023. 
The efficiency ratio 
for the third quarter of 
2024 was 52.41 , compared 
to 50.71 for the 
third quarter of 2023. 
 The 6.3 million increase was primarily due to: 
 
 A 2.5 million increase in employees compensation and benefits expenses, 
driven by annual salary merit increases. 
 
 A 
 1.5 
million 
increase 
in 
professional 
service 
fees, 
due 
to 
increases 
of 
 1.0 
million 
in 
consulting 
fees 
driven 
by 
 information technology infrastructure enhancements and 0.5 million 
in outsourced technology service fees. 
 
 A 0.9 million increase in other 
non-interest expenses, mainly due to 
a 1.8 million increase in charges 
for operational and 
 fraud 
losses, 
partially 
offset 
by 
decreases 
of 
 0.4 
million 
in 
amortization 
of 
intangible 
assets (mainly 
from 
core 
deposit 
 intangible 
assets 
related 
to 
savings 
accounts 
from 
the 
Banco 
Santander 
Puerto 
Rico 
acquisition, 
which 
were 
fully 
 amortized in 2024), 0.3 million in insurance fees, and 0.2 million 
in net periodic cost of pension plans. 
 
 A 0.8 million decrease 
in net gains on OREO 
operations, driven by 
a decrease in net realized 
gains on sales of residential 
 OREO properties in the Puerto Rico region. 
 Non-interest 
expenses 
for 
the 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
amounted 
to 
 362.5 
million, 
compared 
to 
 344.8 
 million for 
the same 
period in 
2023. The 
efficiency ratio 
for the 
first nine 
months of 
2024 was 
52.03 , compared 
to 49.29 
for the 
 first 
nine 
months 
of 
2023. 
Non-interest 
expenses 
for 
the 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
include 
the 
 1.1 
million 
 additional 
FDIC 
special 
assessment 
expense. 
See 
 Non-GAAP 
Financial 
Measures 
and 
Reconciliations 
above 
for 
additional 
 information. 
On 
a 
non-GAAP 
basis, 
excluding 
the 
effect 
of 
this 
Special 
Item, 
adjusted 
non-interest 
expenses 
increased 
by 
 16.6 
 million primarily due to: 
 
 An 8.8 
million increase 
in employees 
compensation and 
benefits expenses, 
driven by 
annual salary 
merit increases 
and 
 increases 
in 
stock-based 
compensation 
expense, 
matching 
contributions 
to 
the 
employees 
retirement 
plan 
and 
medical 
 insurance premium costs. 
 
 A 
 3.1 
million 
increase 
in 
professional 
service 
fees, 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
 2.4 
million 
increase 
in 
consulting 
fees 
driven 
by 
 information technology infrastructure enhancements. 
 
 A 1.8 million increase in credit and debit card processing fees, driven 
by higher transactional volumes. 
 
 A 
 1.6 
million 
increase 
in 
occupancy 
and 
equipment 
expenses, 
mainly 
related 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
maintenance 
charges, 
 partially offset by a decrease in depreciation charges. 
 
 A 1.6 million increase in other 
non-interest expenses, mainly due to 
a 2.8 million increase in charges 
for operational and 
 fraud 
losses, partially 
offset 
by 
decreases 
of 
 0.8 
million 
in amortization 
of 
intangible 
assets due 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
 core deposit intangible assets which were fully amortized in 2024, and 0.5 million 
in net periodic cost of pension plans.

 Income Taxes 
 For 
the 
third 
quarter 
and 
first nine 
months 
of 2024, 
the 
Corporation 
recorded 
an 
income tax 
expense 
of 22.7 
million 
and 
 72.2 
 million, respectively, 
compared to 27.0 million and 89.2 million, 
respectively, for 
the same periods in 2023. The decrease 
in income 
 tax expense 
for the 
third quarter 
of 2024 
was mainly 
due to 
lower pre-tax 
income and, 
to a 
lesser extent, 
a lower 
estimated effective 
 tax rate due 
to increased business 
activities with preferential 
tax treatment under 
the PR Tax 
Code and a 
 0.4 million tax 
contingency 
 accrual release 
in connection with 
the expiration 
of the statute 
of limitation on 
some uncertain tax 
positions. Meanwhile, the 
decrease 
 in income 
tax expense 
for the first 
nine months 
of 2024 
was driven 
by a lower 
estimated effective 
tax rate due 
to the 
aforementioned 
 increased business activities with preferential tax treatment and, 
to a lesser extent, lower pre-tax income. 
 The 
Corporation s 
annual 
estimated 
effective 
tax 
rate, 
excluding 
entities 
with 
pre-tax 
losses 
from 
which 
a 
tax 
benefit 
cannot 
be 
 recognized 
and 
discrete 
items, 
was 
23.7 
for 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024, 
compared 
to 
28.2 
for 
the 
same 
period 
in 
2023. 
The 
 estimated effective 
tax rate 
of the 
Corporation is 
impacted by, 
among other 
things, the 
composition and 
source of 
its taxable 
income. 
 See Note 16 Income Taxes, 
 
to the unaudited consolidated financial statements herein for additional 
information. 
 As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Corporation had 
a net 
deferred tax 
asset of 
 137.5 million, 
net of 
a valuation 
allowance of 
 121.6 
 million against 
the deferred 
tax asset, 
compared to 
a net 
deferred tax 
asset of 
 150.1 million, 
net of 
a valuation 
allowance of 
 139.2 
 million, as 
of December 
31, 2023. 
The decrease 
in the 
net deferred 
tax asset 
was mainly 
related to 
the usage 
of alternative 
minimum 
 tax credits 
and the 
decrease in 
the ACL. 
Meanwhile, the 
decrease in 
the valuation 
allowance was 
related primarily 
to changes 
in the 
 market 
value 
of available 
-for-sale 
debt 
securities 
which 
resulted 
in 
an 
equal 
change 
in 
the net 
deferred 
tax 
asset without 
impacting 
 earnings.

 Assets

The Corporation s 
total assets 
were 18.9 
billion as 
of September 
30, 2024, 
a decrease 
of 50.4 
million from 
December 31, 
2023, 
 primarily related to repayments of investment securities, partially offset 
by an increase in total loans and cash and cash equivalents. 
 Loans Receivable, including Loans Held for Sale 
 As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Corporation s 
total loan 
portfolio before 
the ACL 
amounted to 
 12.5 billion, 
an increase 
of 265.8 
 million 
compared 
to 
December 
31, 
2023. 
In 
terms 
of 
geography, 
the 
growth 
consisted 
of 
increases 
of 
 162.9 
million 
in 
the 
Puerto 
 Rico region and 
 146.0 million in 
the Florida region, 
partially offset 
by a decrease 
of 43.1 million 
in the Virgin 
Islands region. On 
a 
 portfolio basis, 
the growth 
consisted of 
increases of 
 178.4 million 
in commercial 
and construction 
loans, 
 83.7 million 
in consumer 
 loans, 
primarily auto loans and finance leases, and 3.7 million in residential mortgage loans. 
 As of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the Corporation s 
loans 
held-for-investment 
portfolio 
was 
comprised 
of 
commercial 
and 
construction 
 loans 
(48 ), 
consumer 
and 
finance

(29 ), 
and 
residential

 Residential Real Estate Loans 
 As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Corporation s 
total residential 
mortgage 
loan portfolio, 
including loans 
held for 
sale, increased 
by 
 3.7 
million 
compared 
to 
the 
balance 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023. 
The 
increase 
in 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
portfolio 
reflects 
an 
 increase of 26.7 million in the Florida region, partially offset 
by decreases of 14.0 million in the Puerto Rico region and 9.0 million 
 in the 
Virgin 
Islands region. 
The increase 
was driven 
by the 
volume of 
new loan 
originations kept 
on the 
balance sheet, 
which more 
 than 
offset 
repayments. 
Approximately 
48 
of 
the 
 254.5 
million 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
originations 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
region 
 during 
the first 
nine 
months
 of 
2024 consisted 
of conforming 
loans, compared 
to 52 
of the 
 243.2 
million 
originated 
for 
the first 
 nine months
 of 2023. 

As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
majority of 
the Corporation s 
outstanding balance 
of residential 
mortgage loans 
in the 
Puerto Rico 
 and the Virgin 
Islands regions consisted 
of fixed-rate loans 
that traditionally carry 
higher yields than 
residential mortgage loans 
in the 
 Florida region. In 
the Florida region, 
approximately 35 of the 
residential mortgage loan 
portfolio consisted of 
hybrid adjustable-rate 
 mortgages. In 
accordance with 
the Corporation s 
underwriting guidelines, 
residential mortgage 
loans are 
primarily fully 
documented 
 loans, and the Corporation does not originate negative amortization loans. 
 Commercial and Construction Loans 
 As of September 
30, 2024, the 
Corporation s 
commercial and construction 
loans portfolio increased 
by 178.4 million, 
as compared 
 to the 
balance as 
of December 
31, 2023. 
The growth 
included an 
increase of 
 117.6 
million in 
the Florida 
region, reflecting, 
among 
 other things, the effect of the origination 
of various commercial and construction relationships, each in 
excess of 10 million, of which 
 109.3 
million 
are related 
to six 
C I relationships 
and 
 52.3 
million 
are related 
to three 
commercial 
mortgage 
relationships. 
These 
 variances were partially 
offset by payoffs 
and paydowns of four 
C I relationships totaling 
 56.6 million and 
lower utilization of C I 
 lines of credit. 
 The 
Puerto 
Rico region 
also grew 
by 96.2 
million, when 
compared 
to the 
balance 
as of 
December 31, 
2023. 
This increase 
was 
 driven by a 61.7 
million increase in construction 
loans; the origination 
of two commercial 
relationships with an 
aggregate balance of 
 72.4 million; higher utilization 
of C I lines of 
credit; and the origination 
of two loans to 
municipalities with an 
aggregate balance of 
 27.7 million. These variances 
were partially offset 
by multiple payoffs 
and paydowns, including the 
payoffs of three 
commercial and 
 construction relationships totaling 47.5 million and the sale of an 
 8.2 million nonaccrual C I loan, net of a 1.2 million charge 
-off. 
 In 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
region, 
commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
decreased 
by 
 35.4 
million, 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
balance 
as 
of 
 December 31, 2023, mainly associated with a 42.6 million repayment of 
a government line of credit. 

 See Risk Management 
Exposure to Puerto Rico Government 
and Risk Management 
Exposure to USVI Government 
below 
 for information on the Corporation s 
credit exposure to PR and USVI government entities. 
 As of 
September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation s 
total commercial 
mortgage 
loan 
exposure amounted 
to 2.5 
billion, 
or 20 
of the 
 total loan portfolio. In terms of 
geography, 1.7 billion 
of the exposure was in the Puerto 
Rico region, 0.7 billion of the exposure 
was 
 in the 
Florida region, 
and 0.1 
billion of 
the exposure 
was in 
the Virgin 
Islands region. 
The 1.7 
billion exposure 
in the 
Puerto Rico 
 region was 
comprised mainly 
of 41 
in the 
retail industry, 
26 in 
office real 
estate, and 
21 in 
the hotel 
industry. 
The 0.7 
billion 
 exposure 
in the 
Florida region 
was comprised 
mainly of 
33 in 
the retail 
industry, 
23 in 
the hotel 
industry, 
and 8 
in office 
real 
 estate. 
Of 
the 
Corporation s 
total 
commercial 
mortgage 
loan 
exposure 
of 
 2.5 
billion, 
 400.2 
million 
matures 
within 
the 
next 
12 
 months and has a weighted-average 
interest rate of approximately 6.17 . 
Commercial mortgage loan exposure 
in the office real estate 
 industry, 
which 
matures 
within 
the 
next 
12 
months, 
amounted 
to 
 108.1 
million 
and 
has 
a 
weighted-average 
interest 
rate 
of 
 approximately 6.22 . 

 As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024 
and 
December 
31, 
2023, 
the 
Corporation s 
total 
exposure 
to 
shared 
national 
credit SNC 
loans 
 (including 
unused 
commitments) 
amounted 
to 1.3 
billion 
and 
 1.2 
billion, 
respectively. 
As of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
approximately 
 385.3 million of the SNC exposure is related to the portfolio 
in the Puerto Rico region and 870.3 million is related to 
the portfolio in 
 the Florida region. 
 Consumer Loans and Finance Leases 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation s 
consumer loans and finance leases portfolio increased 
by 83.7 million to 3.7 billion, 
 mainly in 
the Puerto 
Rico region, 
reflecting growth 
of 69.4 
million and 
 36.6 million 
in the 
auto loan 
and finance 
lease portfolios, 
 respectively, 
partially offset by decreases in the remaining portfolio classes.

 Loan Production 
 First BanCorp. 
relies primarily 
on its 
retail network 
of branches 
to originate 
residential and 
consumer loans. 
The Corporation 
may 
 supplement 
its residential 
mortgage originations 
with wholesale 
servicing released 
mortgage loan 
purchases from 
mortgage bankers. 
 The 
Corporation 
manages 
its 
construction 
and 
commercial 
loan 
originations 
through 
centralized 
units 
and 
most 
of 
its 
originations 
 come 
from 
existing 
customers, 
as 
well 
as 
through 
referrals 
and 
direct 
solicitations. 
Auto 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
originations 
rely 
 primarily on relationships with auto dealers and dedicated sales professionals who 
serve selected locations to facilitate originations.

 Commercial 
and 
construction 
loan 
originations 
(excluding 
government 
loans) 
for 
the 
quarter 
and 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
 September 30, 
2024 increased 
by 102.8 
million in 
the third 
quarter of 
2024, as 
compared to 
the same 
period in 
2023, mainly 
due to 
 increases of 
 57.1 
million 
in the 
Florida 
region 
and 39.9 
million 
in the 
Puerto 
Rico region. 
For the 
first nine 
months
 of 2024, 
the 
 increase of 259.8 
million was mainly 
due to an increase 
of 274.3 million 
in the Florida region. 
The growth in the 
Florida region for 
 the first 
nine 
months
 of 2024 
includes 
the effect 
of the 
origination 
of ten 
C I relationships, 
each in 
excess of 
 10 million, 
with an 
 aggregate 
balance 
of 
 193.7 
million, 
increased 
utilization 
of 
C I 
lines 
of 
credit, 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
commercial 
mortgage 
loan 
 portfolio of 44.6 million. 
 Government 
loan 
originations 
for 
the 
quarter 
and 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
amounted 
to 
 45.1 
million 
and 
 83.9 
million, 
respectively, 
compared 
to 
 85.1 
million 
and 
 168.7 
million, 
respectively, 
for 
the 
comparable 
periods 
in 
2023. 
The 
 decrease for 
the first nine 
months of 2024 
was mainly related 
to the refinancing 
of a 46.5 
million municipal 
bond into a 
commercial 
 loan in the Puerto Rico region for the first nine months of 2023 and lower 
line of credit utilization in the Virgin 
Islands region. 
 Originations of auto 
loans (including finance 
leases) for the 
quarter and nine-month 
period ended September 
30, 2024 amounted 
to 
 238.8 
million 
and 
 700.8 
million, 
respectively, 
compared 
to 
 259.2 
million 
and 
 754.6 
million, 
respectively, 
for 
the 
comparable 
 periods 
in 
2023. 
The 
decrease 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
and 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024, 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
same 
periods 
in 
2023, 
was 
 mainly 
in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
region. 
Other 
consumer 
loan 
originations, 
other 
than 
credit 
cards, 
for 
the 
quarter 
and 
nine-month 
period 
 ended September 30, 2024 amounted 
to 60.9 million and 185.4 million, 
respectively, 
compared to 79.5 million and 229.0 million, 
 respectively, 
for the 
comparable periods 
in 2023. 
Most of 
the decrease 
in other 
consumer loan 
originations for 
the third 
quarter and 
 first nine 
months
 of 2024, 
as compared 
with the 
same periods 
in 2023, 
was in 
the Puerto 
Rico region. 
The utilization 
activity on 
the 
 outstanding 
credit card 
portfolio 
for 
the 
quarter 
and 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
amounted 
to 117.2 
million 
and 
 349.5 million, respectively, 
compared to 123.4 million and 367.8 million, respectively, 
for the comparable periods in 2023.

 Investment Activities 
 As 
part 
of 
its 
liquidity, 
revenue 
diversification, 
and 
interest 
rate 
risk 
management 
strategies, 
First 
BanCorp. 
maintains 
a 
debt 
 securities portfolio classified as available for sale or held to maturity. 

 The 
Corporation s 
total 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities 
portfolio 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024 
amounted 
to 
 4.9 
billion, 
a 
 335.2 
 million decrease 
from December 31, 
2023. The decrease 
was driven by 
repayments of approximately 
 274.3 million of 
U.S. agencies 
 MBS and 
debentures, 
and repayments 
of 255.9 
million 
associated to 
matured securities 
. 
These variances 
were partially 
offset 
by a 
 155.5 
million 
increase 
in 
fair 
value 
attributable 
to 
changes 
in 
market 
interest 
rates 
and 
 44.1 
million 
in 
purchases 
of 
Community 
 Reinvestment Act qualified debt 
securities, 
mainly commercial MBS, during 
the first nine months of 2024. 
As of September 30, 2024, 
 the Corporation had a net 
unrealized loss on available-for-sale 
debt securities of 477.3 million. 
This net unrealized loss is attributable 
 to instruments on 
books carrying a 
lower interest rate 
than market rates. 
The Corporation expects 
that this unrealized 
loss will reverse 
 over time and it is likely 
that it will not be 
required to sell the securities before 
their anticipated recovery. 
The Corporation expects the 
 portfolio will 
continue to 
decrease and 
the accumulated 
other comprehensive 
loss will 
decrease accordingly, 
excluding the 
impact of 
 market interest rates. 
As of September 
30, 2024, approximately 
 480 million and 
 350 million in 
cash inflows, which 
are expected to 
 be received during the remainder of 2024 and in the first quarter 
of 2025, respectively, from 
contractual maturities of the available-for-
 sale debt securities 
portfolio, 
are expected 
to be redeployed 
to fund 
loan growth, 
reinvested into 
higher-yielding securities, 
or used to 
 repay maturing brokered CDs. 

 As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
substantially 
all 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities 
portfolio 
was 
invested 
in 
U.S. 
 government and 
agencies debentures 
and fixed-rate 
GSEs MBS. In 
addition, as 
of September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation 
held a 
bond 
 issued 
by 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Housing 
Finance 
Authority PRHFA ), 
classified 
as 
available 
for 
sale, 
specifically 
a 
residential 
pass-
 through 
MBS in 
the 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
 3.0 
million 
(fair 
value 
- 
 1.6 
million). 
This 
residential 
pass-through 
MBS 
issued 
by 
the 
 PRHFA 
is collateralized 
by certain 
second 
mortgages originated 
under a 
program 
launched by 
the Puerto 
Rico government 
in 2010 
 and had an unrealized loss 
of 1.4 million as of 
September 30, 2024, of which 
 0.3 million is due to 
credit deterioration. During 2021, 
 the Corporation 
placed this 
instrument in 
nonaccrual status 
based on 
the delinquency 
status of 
the underlying 
second mortgage 
loans 
 collateral. 
 Held-to-maturity 
debt 
securities 
include 
fixed-rate 
GSEs 
MBS 
with 
a 
carrying 
value 
of 
 231.0 
million 
(fair 
value 
of 
 222.2 
 million) as of September 30, 2024, 
compared to 247.1 million as of December 
31, 2023. Held-to-maturity debt securities also 
include 
 financing 
arrangements 
with 
Puerto 
Rico 
municipalities 
issued 
in 
bond 
form, 
which 
the 
Corporation 
accounts 
for 
as securities, 
but 
 which were 
underwritten as 
loans with 
features that 
are typically 
found in 
commercial loans. 
Puerto Rico 
municipal bonds 
typically 
 are 
not 
issued 
in 
bearer 
form, 
are 
not 
registered 
with 
the 
SEC, 
and 
are 
not 
rated 
by 
external 
credit 
agencies. 
These 
bonds 
have 
 seniority to the payment of operating costs and expenses of 
the municipality and, in most cases, are supported by assigned 
property tax 
 revenues. 
As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
approximately 
57 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
municipal 
bonds 
consisted 
of 
obligations 
issued 
by 
 three 
of 
the 
largest 
municipalities 
in 
Puerto 
Rico. 
The 
municipalities 
are 
required 
by 
law 
to 
levy 
special 
property 
taxes 
in 
such 
 amounts as 
are required 
for the 
payment of 
all of 
their respective 
general obligation 
bonds and 
loans. As 
of September 
30, 2024, 
the 
 Corporation s 
held-to-maturity debt 
securities portfolio, 
before the 
ACL, decreased 
to 323.1 
million, compared 
to 354.2 
million as 
 of December 31, 
2023, driven by 
repayments of approximately 
 16.6 million of 
U.S. agencies MBS and 
 15.9 million of 
Puerto Rico 
 municipal bonds.

 Net 
interest 
income 
in 
future 
periods 
could 
be 
affected 
by 
prepayments 
of 
MBS. 
Any 
acceleration 
in 
the 
prepayments 
of 
MBS 
 purchased 
at 
a 
premium
 would 
lower 
yields 
on 
these 
securities, 
since 
the 
amortization 
of 
premiums 
paid 
upon 
acquisition 
would 
 accelerate. Conversely, 
acceleration of the 
prepayments of MBS would 
increase yields on 
securities purchased at 
a discount, since 
the 
 accretion of the discount would accelerate. These risks are 
directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. 
Net interest 
 income in 
future periods 
might also be 
affected by 
the Corporation s 
investment in 
callable securities. 
As of September 
30, 2024, 
the 
 Corporation had 
approximately 1.5 
billion in 
callable debt 
securities (U.S. 
agencies debt 
securities) with 
an average 
yield of 
0.81 
 of which 
approximately 62 
were purchased 
at a discount 
and 2 at 
a premium.

 RISK MANAGEMENT
 General
 Risks 
are 
inherent 
in 
virtually 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
business 
activities 
and 
operations. 
Consequently, 
effective 
risk 
 management 
is 
fundamental 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Corporation. 
The 
primary 
goals 
of 
risk 
management 
are 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
 Corporation s 
risk-taking activities are 
consistent with the 
Corporation s 
objectives and risk 
tolerance, and that 
there is an appropriate 
 balance between risks and rewards to maximize stockholder value. 
 The 
Corporation 
has 
in 
place 
a 
risk 
management 
framework 
to 
monitor, 
evaluate 
and 
manage 
the 
principal 
risks 
assumed 
in 
 conducting its activities. First BanCorp. s 
business is subject to eleven 
broad categories of risks: (i) liquidity 
risk; (ii) interest rate risk; 
 (iii) market risk; (iv) 
credit risk; (v) operational 
risk; (vi) legal and 
regulatory risk; (vii) 
reputational risk; (viii) model 
risk; (ix) capital 
 risk; (x) 
strategic risk; 
and (xi) 
information technology 
risk. First 
BanCorp. has 
adopted policies 
and procedures 
designed to 
identify 
 and manage the risks to which the Corporation is exposed. 
 The 
Corporation s 
risk 
management 
policies 
are 
described 
below, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
Part 
II, 
Item 
7, 
 Management s 
Discussion 
and 
 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the 2023 
Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Liquidity Risk 

 Liquidity 
risk 
involves 
the 
ongoing 
ability 
to 
accommodate 
liability 
maturities 
and 
deposit 
withdrawals, 
fund 
asset growth 
and 
 business operations, 
and meet 
contractual obligations 
through unconstrained 
access to funding 
at reasonable 
market rates. Liquidity 
 management 
involves 
forecasting 
funding 
requirements 
and 
maintaining 
sufficient 
capacity 
to 
meet 
liquidity 
needs 
and 
 accommodate 
fluctuations 
in 
asset 
and 
liability 
levels 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
business 
operations 
or 
unanticipated 
 events. 

The Corporation 
manages liquidity 
at two 
levels. The 
first is 
the liquidity 
of the 
parent company, 
or First 
Bancorp., which 
is the 
 holding 
company 
that 
owns 
the 
banking 
and 
non-banking 
subsidiaries. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
liquidity 
of 
the 
banking 
subsidiary, 
 FirstBank. 

 The 
Asset 
and 
Liability 
Committee 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
is 
responsible 
for 
overseeing 
management s 
 establishment 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
policy, 
as 
well 
as 
approving 
operating 
and 
contingency 
procedures 
and 
monitoring 
 liquidity 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis. 
The 
Management s 
Investment 
and 
Asset 
Liability 
Committee MIALCO ), 
which 
reports 
to 
the 
 Board s 
Asset 
and 
Liability 
Committee, 
uses 
measures 
of 
liquidity 
developed 
by 
management 
that 
involve 
the 
use 
of 
several 
 assumptions 
to 
review 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
position 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis. 
The 
MIALCO 
oversees 
liquidity 
management, 
 interest rate risk, market risk, and other related matters. 

The MIALCO is composed of 
senior management officers, including 
the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer, 
the 
 Chief 
Risk 
Officer, 
the 
Corporate 
Strategic 
and 
Business 
Development 
Director, 
the 
Business 
Group 
Director, 
the 
Treasury 
and 
 Investments Risk 
Manager, 
the Financial 
Planning and 
Asset and 
Liability Management ALM Director, 
and the 
Treasurer. 
The 
 Treasury 
and 
Investments 
Division 
is 
responsible 
for 
planning 
and 
executing 
the 
Corporation s 
funding 
activities 
and 
strategy, 
 monitoring 
liquidity availability 
on a 
daily basis, 
and reviewing 
liquidity measures 
on a 
weekly basis. 
The Financial 
Planning and 
 ALM Division is responsible for estimating the liquidity gap. 

101
 To 
ensure 
adequate liquidity 
through the 
full range 
of potential 
operating 
environments and 
market conditions, 
the Corporation 
 conducts 
its 
liquidity 
management 
and 
business 
activities 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
is 
intended 
to 
preserve 
and 
enhance 
funding 
stability, 
 flexibility, 
and 
diversity. 
Key 
components 
of 
this 
operating 
strategy 
include 
a 
strong 
focus 
on 
the 
continued 
development 
of 
 customer-based 
funding, the 
maintenance 
of direct 
relationships with 
wholesale 
market funding 
providers, and 
the maintenance 
of 
 the ability to liquidate certain assets when, and if, requirements warrant. 

The 
Corporation 
develops 
and 
maintains 
contingency 
funding 
plans. 
These 
plans 
evaluate 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
position 
 under various 
operating circumstances 
and are 
designed to 
help ensure 
that the 
Corporation will 
be able 
to operate 
through periods 
 of stress when 
access to normal 
sources of funds 
is constrained. The 
plans project funding 
requirements during 
a potential period 
of 
 stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, 
outline actions and procedures for effectively managing 
liquidity through a period of 
 stress, and 
define roles 
and responsibilities 
for the 
Corporation s 
employees. Under 
the contingency 
funding plans, 
the Corporation 
 stresses the 
balance sheet 
and the 
liquidity position 
to critical levels 
that mimic 
difficulties in 
generating funds 
or even maintaining 
 the current 
funding position 
of the 
Corporation and 
the Bank 
and are 
designed to 
help ensure 
the ability 
of the 
Corporation and 
the 
 Bank to honor 
their respective commitments. 
The Corporation has 
established liquidity 
triggers that the 
MIALCO monitors in 
order 
 to maintain the 
ordinary funding of 
the banking business. 
The MIALCO has 
developed contingency funding 
plans for the 
following 
 three 
scenarios: 
a 
credit rating 
downgrade, 
an 
economic 
cycle 
downturn 
event, 
and 
a 
concentration 
event. 
The 
Board s 
Asset and 
 Liability Committee reviews and approves these plans on an annual basis. 
 Liquidity Risk Management 
 The Corporation manages 
its liquidity in 
a proactive manner and 
in an effort 
to maintain a sound 
liquidity position. It uses 
multiple 
 measures 
to monitor 
its liquidity 
position, 
including 
core 
liquidity, 
basic 
liquidity, 
and time-based 
reserve 
measures. Cash 
and 
cash 
 equivalents 
amounted 
to 
 685.4 
million 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
compared 
to 
 663.2 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023. 
When 
 adding 1.8 billion of free high-quality 
liquid securities that could be liquidated 
or pledged within one day (which 
includes assets such 
 as U.S. 
government and 
GSEs obligations), 
the total 
core liquidity 
amounted to 
 2.5 billion 
as of 
September 30, 
2024, or 
13.32 of 
 total assets, compared to 2.8 billion, or 14.93 of total assets as of December 
31, 2023. 

 In 
addition 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
 1.8 
billion 
in 
cash 
and 
free 
high 
quality 
liquid 
assets, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 964.7 
million 
 available 
for 
credit 
with 
the FHLB 
based 
on 
the 
value 
of loan 
collateral 
pledged 
with 
the 
FHLB. 
As 
such, 
the 
basic 
liquidity 
ratio 
 (which adds such 
available secured 
lines of credit 
to the core 
liquidity) was approximately 
18.43 of total 
assets as of September 
30, 
 2024, 
compared to 19.82 of total assets as of December 31, 2023. 

 Further, 
the 
Corporation 
also 
maintains 
borrowing 
capacity 
at 
the 
FED 
Discount 
Window 
and 
had 
approximately 
 2.6 
billion 
 available 
for 
funding 
under 
the FED s 
Borrower-in-Custody BIC 
Program 
as of 
September 
30, 
2024 
as an 
additional 
source 
of 
 liquidity. 
Total loans 
pledged to the FED 
BIC Program amounted 
to 3.4 billion as of 
September 30, 2024. The 
Corporation also does 
 not rely 
on uncommitted 
inter-bank 
lines of 
credit (federal 
funds lines) 
to fund 
its operations. 
In the 
aggregate, 
as of 
September 30, 
 2024, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 6.1 
billion 
available 
to 
meet 
liquidity 
needs, 
or 
131 
of 
estimated 
uninsured 
deposits, 
excluding 
fully 
 collateralized government deposits. 

 Liquidity 
at 
the Bank 
level 
is highly 
dependent 
on 
bank deposits, 
which 
fund 
86.9 
of the 
Bank s 
assets (or 
84.1 
excluding 
 brokered CDs). 
In addition, 
as further 
discussed below, 
the Corporation 
maintains a 
diversified base 
of readily 
available wholesale 
 funding 
sources, 
including 
advances 
from 
the 
FHLB 
through 
pledged 
borrowing 
capacity, 
securities 
sold 
under 
agreements 
to 
 repurchase, and access to brokered CDs. Funding 
through wholesale funding may continue to increase 
the overall cost of funding for 
 the Corporation and adversely affect the net interest margin. 

102
 Commitments to extend credit and standby 
letters of credit 
 As 
a 
provider 
of 
financial 
services, 
the 
Corporation 
routinely 
enters 
into 
commitments 
with 
off-balance 
sheet 
risk 
to 
meet 
the 
 financial 
needs 
of 
its 
customers. 
These 
financial 
instruments 
may 
include 
loan 
commitments 
and 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit. 
These 
 commitments 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
same 
credit 
policies 
and 
approval 
processes 
used 
for 
on-balance 
sheet 
instruments. 
These 
 instruments involve, to varying degrees, 
elements of credit and interest rate risk 
in excess of the amount recognized in the 
statements 
 of financial 
condition. As 
of September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation s 
commitments to 
extend credit 
amounted to 
approximately 2.1 
 billion. 
Commitments 
to 
extend 
credit 
are 
agreements 
to 
lend 
to 
a 
customer 
as 
long 
as 
there 
is 
no 
violation 
of 
any 
condition 
 established 
in 
the 
contract. 
Since 
certain 
commitments 
are 
expected 
to 
expire 
without 
being 
drawn 
upon, 
the 
total 
commitment 
 amount does 
not necessarily 
represent future 
cash requirements. For 
most of the 
commercial lines of 
credit, the 
Corporation has 
the 
 option 
to 
reevaluate 
the 
agreement 
prior 
to 
additional 
disbursements. 
There 
have 
been 
no 
significant 
or 
unexpected 
draws 
on 
 existing commitments. In the case of 
credit cards and personal lines 
of credit, the Corporation can 
cancel the unused credit facility 
at 
 any time and without cause.

 The 
Corporation 
engages 
in 
the ordinary 
course 
of business 
in 
other 
financial 
transactions 
that 
are not 
recorded 
on the 
balance 
 sheet 
or 
may 
be 
recorded 
on 
the 
balance 
sheet 
in 
amounts 
that 
are 
different 
from 
the 
full 
contract 
or 
notional 
amount 
of 
the 
 transaction 
and, thus, 
affect 
the Corporation s 
liquidity position. 
These transactions 
are designed 
to (i) 
meet the 
financial needs 
of 
 customers, (ii) manage the 
Corporation s credit, 
market and liquidity risks, (iii) 
diversify the Corporation s 
funding sources, and (iv) 
 optimize capital. 

 In addition to the 
aforementioned off-balance 
sheet debt obligations 
and unfunded commitments 
to extend credit, 
the Corporation 
 has 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
to 
make 
future 
payments 
under 
contracts, 
amounting 
to 
approximately 
 4.3 
billion 
as 
of 
 September 30, 
2024. Our 
material cash 
requirements comprise 
primarily of 
contractual obligations 
to make future 
payments related 
 to time 
deposits, long-term 
borrowings, and 
operating lease 
obligations. 
 We 
 also have 
other contractual 
cash obligations 
related to 
 certain binding agreements 
we have entered 
into for services 
including outsourcing 
of technology services, 
security, 
advertising and 
 other 
services 
which 
are 
not material 
to 
our 
liquidity 
needs. 
 We 
 currently 
anticipate 
that our 
available 
funds, 
credit 
facilities, and 
 cash flows from 
operations will be 
sufficient to meet 
our operational cash 
needs and support 
loan growth and 
capital plan execution 
 for the foreseeable future. 
 Off-balance sheet 
transactions are continuously 
monitored to consider 
their potential impact 
to our liquidity 
position and changes 
 are applied to the balance between sources and uses of funds, as deemed appropriate, 
to maintain a sound liquidity position. 

103
 Sources of Funding 
 The Corporation 
utilizes different 
sources of 
funding to 
help ensure 
that adequate 
levels of 
liquidity are 
available when 
needed. 
 Diversification 
of 
funding 
sources 
is 
of 
great 
importance 
to 
protect 
the 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
from 
market 
disruptions. 
The 
 principal 
sources 
of 
short-term 
funding 
are 
deposits, 
including 
brokered 
CDs. 
Additional 
funding 
is 
provided 
by 
securities 
sold 
 under agreements 
to repurchase and 
lines of credit 
with the FHLB. 
In addition, 
the Corporation also 
maintains as additional 
sources 
 borrowing capacity at the FED s BIC Program 
, 
as discussed above. 
 The Asset and Liability Committee reviews credit availability 
on a regular basis. The Corporation may 
also sell mortgage loans as 
 a supplementary source of funding and obtain long-term funding 
through the issuance of notes and long-term brokered CDs. 

 While 
liquidity 
is 
an 
ongoing 
challenge 
for 
all 
financial 
institutions, 
management 
believes 
that 
the 
Corporation s 
available 
 borrowing capacity and 
efforts to grow 
core deposits will be 
adequate to provide 
the necessary funding 
for the Corporation s 
business 
 plans in the next 12 months and beyond. 
 Retail 
and 
commercial 
core 
deposits 
 
 The 
Corporation s 
deposit 
products 
include 
regular 
saving 
accounts, 
demand 
deposit 
 accounts, money market accounts, 
and retail CDs. As of September 30, 
2024 and 
December 31, 2023 the Corporation s 
core deposits, 
 which 
exclude 
government 
deposits 
and 
brokered 
CDs, 
totaled 
 12.7 
billion 
and 
 12.6 
billion, 
respectively. 
The 
 69.2 
million 
 increase 
in 
such 
deposits 
consisted 
of 
increases 
of 
 58.8 
million 
in 
the 
Florida 
region 
and 
 40.2 
million 
in 
the Puerto 
Rico 
region, 
 partially 
offset 
by 
a 
 29.8 
million 
decrease 
in 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
region. 
This 
increase 
includes 
a 
 198.2 
million 
increase 
in 
time 
 deposits. 

 Government 
deposits 
(fully 
collateralized)

As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 2.7 
billion 
of 
Puerto 
Rico 
public 
 sector 
deposits 2.5 
billion 
in 
transactional 
accounts 
and 
 150.1 
million 
in 
time 
deposits), 
relatively 
unchanged 
compared 
to 
the 
 balance as of December 31, 
2023. Government deposits are insured 
by the FDIC up to the applicable 
limits and the uninsured portions 
 are 
fully 
collateralized. 
Approximately 
22 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
deposits 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024 
were 
from 
municipalities 
and 
 municipal agencies 
in Puerto Rico 
and 78 
were from public 
corporations, the 
central government 
and its agencies, 
and U.S. federal 
 government agencies in Puerto Rico. 
 In addition, 
as of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Corporation 
had 443.9 
million of 
government deposits 
in the 
Virgin 
Islands region, 
as 
 compared 
to 
 449.4 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023, 
and 
 19.2 
million 
in 
the 
Florida 
region 
as 
compared 
to 
 10.2 
million 
as 
of 
 December 31, 2023. 
 The 
uninsured 
portions of 
government 
deposits were 
collateralized 
by securities 
and 
loans with 
an amortized 
cost of 
 3.3 
billion 
 and 3.5 
billion as 
of September 
30, 2024 
and December 
31, 2023, 
respectively, 
and an 
estimated market 
value of 
 3.1 billion 
as of 
 each of 
such periods. 
In addition 
to securities 
and loans, 
as of 
each of 
September 30, 
2024 and 
December 31,2023, 
the Corporation 
 used 175.0 million in letters of credit issued by the FHLB as pledges for 
a portion of public deposits in the Virgin 
Islands. 
 Estimate of Uninsured 
Deposits 
 As of September 
30, 2024 and 
December 31, 2023, 
the estimated amounts 
of uninsured deposits 
 totaled 7.6 
billion and 
 7.4 billion, 
respectively, 
generally representing 
the portion 
of deposits 
that exceed 
the FDIC 
insurance limit 
 of 250,000 
and amounts 
in any 
other uninsured 
deposit account. 
As of 
September 30, 
2024 and 
December 31, 
2023, the 
uninsured 
 portion 
of 
fully 
collateralized 
government 
deposits 
amounted 
to 
 2.9 
billion 
and 
 3.0 
billion, 
respectively. 
Excluding 
fully 
 collateralized government 
deposits, the estimated 
amounts of uninsured 
deposits amounted to 
 4.6 billion, which 
represent 29.25 
of 
 total deposits (excluding brokered CDs), as of September 30, 2024, 
compared to 4.4 billion, or 28.13 , as of December 31, 2023. 

The 
amount of 
uninsured 
deposits 
is calculated 
based on 
the 
same 
methodologies 
and assumptions 
used for 
our bank 
regulatory 
 reporting requirements adjusted for cash held by wholly-owned subsidiaries 
at the Bank.

The following table presents by contractual maturities the amount of U.S. time deposits in

 Brokered 
CDs
 
 Total 
brokered CDs decreased 
by 263.3 
million to 520.0 
million as of 
September 30, 2024, 
compared to 783.3 
 million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023. 
The 
decline 
reflects 
maturing 
brokered 
CDs 
amounting 
to 
 540.5 
million 
with 
an 
all-in 
cost 
of 
 5.43 
that 
were 
paid 
off 
during 
the 
first 
nine 
months 
of 
2024, 
partially 
offset 
by 
 277.2 
million 
of 
new 
issuances 
with 
original 
 average maturities of approximately 2 years and an all-in cost of 4.91 . 
 The average remaining term to maturity of the brokered CDs outstanding 
as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.2 years. 

 The future use 
of brokered 
CDs will depend 
on multiple factors 
including excess 
liquidity at each 
of the regions, 
future cash needs 
 and 
any 
tax implications. 
Also, 
depending 
on 
lending or 
other 
investment 
opportunities available, 
cash 
inflows from 
repayments 
of 
 investment securities 
may be used 
as well 
to repay brokered 
CDs. Brokered 
CDs are insured 
by the FDIC 
up to regulatory 
limits and 
 can be obtained faster than regular retail deposits.

 Securities 
sold 
under 
agreements 
to 
repurchase 

From 
time 
to 
time, 
the 
Corporation 
enters 
into 
repurchase 
agreements 
as 
an 
 additional source of funding. As of September 30, 2024 and December 
31, 2023, there were no outstanding repurchase agreements.
 When 
the 
Corporation 
enters 
into 
repurchase 
agreements, 
as is 
the 
case 
with 
derivative 
contracts, 
the 
Corporation 
is 
required 
to 
 pledge 
cash 
or 
qualifying 
securities 
to 
meet 
margin 
requirements. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
value 
of 
securities 
previously 
pledged 
as 
 collateral 
declines 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates, 
a 
liquidity 
crisis 
or 
any 
other 
factor, 
the 
Corporation 
is 
required 
to 
deposit 
 additional 
cash 
or 
securities 
to 
meet 
its 
margin 
requirements, 
thereby 
adversely 
affecting 
its 
liquidity. 
Given 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
 collateral 
pledged, 
the 
Corporation 
has 
not 
experienced 
margin 
calls 
from 
counterparties 
arising 
from 
credit-quality-related 
write-
 downs in valuations.

 Advances 
from 
the 
FHLB 
 
 The 
Bank 
is 
a 
member 
of 
the 
FHLB 
system 
and 
obtains 
advances 
to 
fund 
its 
operations 
under 
a 
 collateral 
agreement 
with 
the 
FHLB 
that 
requires 
the 
Bank 
to 
maintain 
qualifying 
mortgages 
and/or 
investments 
as 
collateral 
for 
 advances 
taken. 
As of 
each of 
September 
30, 
2024 
and 
December 
31, 
2023, 
the 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
long-term 
fixed-rate 
FHLB 
 advances was 
 500.0 million. 
Of the 
 500.0 million 
in FHLB advances 
as of 
September 30, 
2024, 400.0 
million were 
pledged with 
 investment securities 
and 100.0 
million were 
pledged with 
mortgage loans. 
As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Corporation had 
 964.7 
 million available for additional credit on FHLB lines of credit based on collateral 
pledged at the FHLB of New York.

 Trust-Preferred 
Securities 
 In 2004, 
FBP Statutory 
Trusts 
I and 
II, statutory 
trusts that 
are wholly-owned 
by the 
Corporation and 
 not consolidated 
in the Corporation s 
financial statements, sold 
to institutional investors 
variable-rate TruPS 
and used the 
proceeds of 
 these issuances, together 
with the proceeds 
of the purchases by 
the Corporation of 
variable rate common 
securities, to purchase 
junior 
 subordinated 
deferrable 
debentures. 
The 
subordinated 
debentures 
are 
presented 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
 financial condition as 
other long-term borrowings. 
Under the indentures, 
the Corporation has the 
right, from time 
to time, and without 
 causing an 
event of 
default, to defer 
payments of 
interest on the 
Junior Subordinated 
Deferrable Debentures 
by extending 
the interest 
 payment 
period 
at 
any 
time 
and 
from 
time 
to 
time 
during 
the 
term 
of 
the 
subordinated 
debentures 
for 
up 
to 
twenty 
consecutive 
 quarterly periods. 
 In September 
2024, 
the Corporation 
redeemed 50.0 
million, 
or 42 , 
of outstanding 
TruPS 
issued by 
FBP Statutory 
Trust 
II (or 
 48.5 million after 
excluding the Corporation s 
interest in the Trust 
of approximately 1.5 
million) at a contractual 
call price of 100 
 as part 
of the 
2024 repurchase 
program. 
As of 
September 30, 
2024 and 
December 31, 
2023, the 
Corporation had 
junior subordinated 
 debentures outstanding 
in the aggregate 
amount of 
 111.7 
million and 
 161.7 million, 
respectively, 
with maturity 
dates ranging 
from 
 June 17, 2034 through September 
20, 2034. As of September 30, 
2024, the Corporation was current on 
all interest payments due on its 
 subordinated 
debt.

 Other Sources 
of Funds and 
Liquidity
 
- The Corporation s 
principal uses of 
funds are for 
the origination of 
loans, the repayment 
of 
 maturing deposits 
and borrowings, 
and deposits 
withdrawals. Over 
the years, 
in connection 
with its 
mortgage banking 
activities, the 
 Corporation has invested in technology and personnel to enhance the 
Corporation s secondary mortgage 
market capabilities.
 These enhanced capabilities 
improve the Corporation s 
liquidity profile as they 
allow the Corporation to 
derive liquidity, 
if needed, 
 from the 
sale of mortgage 
loans in 
the secondary 
market. The 
U.S. (including 
Puerto Rico) 
secondary mortgage 
market is 
still highly 
 liquid, 
in 
large 
part because 
of 
the 
sale of 
mortgages 
through 
guarantee 
programs 
of 
the Federal 
Housing 
Authority FHA ), 
U.S. 
 Department of 
Veterans 
Affairs VA ), 
U.S. Department 
of Housing 
and Urban 
Development HUD ), 
Federal National 
Mortgage 
 Association FNMA and Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. FHLMC ). 
During the first nine months 
of 2024, loans pooled into 
 Government 
National 
Mortgage 
Association GNMA 
MBS amounted 
to approximately 
 87.4 
million. 
Also, during 
the first 
nine 
 months of 2024, the Corporation sold approximately 25.8 million of 
performing residential mortgage loans to FNMA. 
 The 
FED 
Discount 
Window 
is 
a 
cost-efficient 
source 
of 
short-term 
funding 
for 
the 
Corporation 
in 
highly-volatile 
market 
 conditions. 
As 
previously 
mentioned, 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
approximately 
 2.6 
billion 
fully 
available 
for 
 funding under the FED s Discount 
Window based on collateral pledged at the FED. 

106
 Effect of Credit Ratings on Access to Liquidity 
 The 
Corporation s 
liquidity 
is 
contingent 
upon 
its 
ability 
to 
obtain 
deposits 
and 
other 
external 
sources 
of 
funding 
to 
finance 
its 
 operations. 
The Corporation s 
current 
credit ratings 
and any 
downgrade 
in credit 
ratings can 
hinder the 
Corporation s 
access to 
new 
 forms 
of 
external 
funding 
and/or 
cause 
external 
funding 
to 
be 
more 
expensive, 
which 
could, 
in 
turn, 
adversely 
affect 
its 
results 
of 
 operations. Also, changes in credit ratings may further affect 
the fair value of unsecured derivatives whose value takes into account 
the 
 Corporation s own credit risk. 

The Corporation 
does not 
have any 
outstanding debt 
or derivative 
agreements that 
would be 
affected by 
credit rating 
downgrades. 
 Furthermore, given the Corporation s 
non-reliance on corporate debt or other 
instruments directly linked in terms 
of pricing or volume 
 to credit 
ratings, the 
liquidity of 
the Corporation 
has not been 
affected in 
any material 
way by downgrades. 
The Corporation s 
ability 
 to access new non-deposit sources of funding, however, 
could be adversely affected by credit downgrades. 
 As of 
the date 
hereof, the 
Corporation s 
credit as 
a long-term 
issuer is 
rated BB+ 
by S P 
and BB 
by Fitch. 
As of 
the date 
hereof, 
 FirstBank s 
credit ratings 
as a long 
-term issuer 
are BB+ by 
S P and 
Fitch, one notch 
below the 
minimum BBB- level 
required to 
be 
 considered investment grade. 
The Corporation s 
credit ratings are dependent 
on a number of 
factors, both quantitative 
and qualitative, 
 and are 
subject to 
change at 
any time. 
The disclosure 
of credit 
ratings is 
not a 
recommendation to 
buy, 
sell or 
hold the 
Corporation s 
 securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any 
other rating. 

107
 Cash Flows
 Cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents 
were 
 685.4 
million 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
an 
increase 
of 
 22.2 
million 
when 
compared 
to 
 December 
31, 
2023. 
The 
following 
discussion 
highlights 
the 
major 
activities 
and 
transactions 
that 
affected 
the 
Corporation s 
cash 
 flows during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023: 

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities
 First BanCorp. s 
operating assets and 
liabilities vary significantly 
in the normal course 
of business due to 
the amount and timing 
of 
 cash flows. 
Management believes 
that cash 
flows from 
operations, available 
cash balances, 
and the 
Corporation s 
ability to 
generate 
 cash through 
short and long-term 
borrowings will be 
sufficient to 
fund the Corporation s 
operating liquidity 
needs for the 
foreseeable 
 future. 
 For the first nine 
months of September 30, 
2024 and 2023, net 
cash provided by operating 
activities was 307.3 million 
and 283.7 
 million, 
respectively. 
Net 
cash 
generated 
from 
operating 
activities 
was 
higher 
than 
reported 
net 
income 
largely 
as 
a 
result 
of 
 adjustments for non-cash items such 
as depreciation and amortization, 
deferred income tax expense and the 
provision for credit losses, 
 as well as cash generated from sales and repayments of loans held for sale. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 The Corporation s 
investing activities primarily 
relate to originating 
loans to be 
held for investment, 
as well as 
purchasing, selling, 
 and 
repaying 
available-for-sale 
and 
held-to-maturity debt 
securities. For 
the nine 
-month period 
ended September 
30, 2024 
, 
net cash 
 provided by investing activities was 213.8 million, primarily due 
to repayments of U.S. agencies MBS, U.S. agencies debentures, 
and 
 Puerto Rico 
municipal bonds; 
proceeds from 
sales of 
repossessed assets; and 
proceeds from 
sales of 
loans, driven 
by the 
bulk sale 
of 
 fully charged-off 
consumer loans during 
the first quarter 
of 2024 and 
the sale of 
an 8.2 million 
nonaccrual C I loan; 
partially offset 
 by net disbursements 
on loans held for 
investment and purchases of 
Community Reinvestment Act qualified 
debt securities during the 
 first nine months of 2024. 
 For the nine-month 
period ended September 
30, 2023, net 
cash provided by 
investing activities was 17.5 
million, primarily due 
to 
 repayments 
of 
U.S. 
agencies 
MBS, 
U.S. 
agencies 
debentures, 
and 
Puerto 
Rico 
municipal 
bonds; 
and 
proceeds 
from 
sales 
of 
 repossessed assets; partially offset by net disbursements 
on loans held for investment. 
 
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
 The Corporation s 
financing activities 
primarily 
include the 
receipt of 
deposits and 
the issuance 
of brokered 
CDs, the 
issuance of 
 and payments 
on long-term 
debt, the 
issuance of 
equity instruments, 
return of 
capital, and 
activities related 
to its 
short-term funding. 
 For 
the 
nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
net cash 
used 
in 
financing 
activities was 
 498.9 
million, 
mainly 
reflecting 
a 
 decrease in total deposits, 
capital returned to stockholders and the redemption 
of junior subordinated debentures in September 2024, 
as 
 further explained in Note 7 Non-Consolidated Variable 
Interest Entities VIEs and Servicing Assets . 

 For the nine 
-month period 
ended September 30, 
2023, net cash 
used in financing 
activities was 196.8 
million, mainly reflecting 
a 
 269.9 million 
net decrease 
in borrowings 
and 200.8 
million of 
capital returned 
to stockholders, 
partially offset 
by a 
 275.8 million 
 net increase in deposits. 

108
 Capital 
 As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Corporation s 
stockholders equity 
was 1.7 
billion, an 
increase of 
 203.3 million 
from December 
 31, 2023. 
The increase 
was driven 
by net 
income generated 
in the 
first nine 
months of 
2024 and 
a 155.5 
million increase 
in the 
fair 
 value of 
available-for-sale debt 
securities recorded 
as part of 
accumulated other 
comprehensive loss 
in the consolidated 
statements of 
 financial 
condition, 
partially 
offset 
by 
 100.0 
million 
in 
common 
stock 
repurchases 
under 
the 
2023 
stock 
repurchase 
program, 
and 
 common stock dividends declared in the first nine months of 2024 totaling 
 79.7 million or 0.48 per common share. 

 On 
October 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation s 
Board 
declared 
a 
quarterly 
cash 
dividend 
of 
 0.16 
per 
common 
share. 
The 
dividend 
is 
 payable on 
December 13, 
2024 to 
shareholders of 
record at 
the close 
of business 
on November 
29, 2024. 
The Corporation 
intends to 
 continue 
to 
pay 
quarterly 
dividends 
on 
common 
stock. 
However, 
the 
Corporation s 
common 
stock 
dividends, 
including 
the 
 declaration, timing and amount, remain subject to the consideration and 
approval by the Corporation s Board 
at the relevant times. 
 On 
July 
24, 2023, 
the Corporation 
announced 
that its 
Board 
of Directors 
approved 
a stock 
repurchase 
program, 
under which 
the 
 Corporation 
may repurchase 
up 
to 225 
million 
of its 
outstanding 
common 
stock, which 
commenced 
in 
the fourth 
quarter 
of 2023. 
 During the 
first nine 
months of 2024, 
the Corporation 
repurchased approximately 
5.8 million 
shares of 
common stock for 
a total cost 
 of 100.0 
million. Furthermore, 
on July 
22, 2024, 
the Corporation 
announced that 
its Board 
of Directors 
approved a 
new repurchase 
 program, 
under which 
the Corporation 
may 
repurchase 
up to 
an 
additional 
 250 million 
that 
could 
include 
repurchases 
of 
common 
 stock or 
junior subordinated 
debentures, which 
it expects 
to execute 
through the 
end of 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2025. As 
of September 
 30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
has 
remaining 
authorization 
of 
approximately 
 250.0 
million 
under 
both 
repurchase 
programs 
after 
the 
 50.0 million redemption of 
junior subordinated debentures in 
September 2024, as further 
explained above. For more 
information, see 
 Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, 
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Repurchases 
under 
the 
programs 
may 
be 
executed 
through 
open 
market 
purchases, 
accelerated 
share 
repurchases, 
privately 
 negotiated 
transactions 
or plans, 
including 
plans complying 
with Rule 
10b5-1 
under 
the Exchange 
Act, and/or 
redemption 
of junior 
 subordinated 
debentures, and 
will be 
conducted 
in accordance 
with applicable 
legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
The Corporation s 
 repurchase programs 
are subject 
to various 
factors, including 
the Corporation s 
capital position, 
liquidity, 
financial performance 
and 
 alternative uses 
of capital, stock 
trading price, and 
general market conditions. 
The Corporation s 
repurchase programs do 
not obligate 
 it to acquire any 
specific number of shares 
and do not have 
an expiration date. The 
repurchase programs may be 
modified, suspended, 
 or 
terminated 
at 
any 
time 
at 
the 
Corporation s 
discretion. 
The 
Corporation s 
holding 
company 
has 
no 
operations 
and 
depends 
on 
 dividends, 
distributions 
and 
other 
payments 
from 
its 
subsidiaries 
to 
fund 
dividend 
payments, 
stock 
repurchases, 
and 
to 
fund 
all 
 payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. 
 The tangible common 
equity ratio and 
tangible book value 
per common share 
are non-GAAP financial 
measures generally used 
by 
 the 
financial 
community 
to 
evaluate 
capital 
adequacy. 
Tangible 
common 
equity 
is 
total 
common 
equity 
less 
goodwill 
and 
other 
 intangible assets. Tangible 
assets are total assets less 
the previously mentioned 
intangible assets. See Non-GAAP

 See Note 21 Regulatory 
Matters, Commitments and Contingencies 
to the unaudited consolidated 
financial statements herein for 
 the regulatory capital positions of the Corporation and FirstBank as of 
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The 
Puerto 
Rico 
Banking 
Law 
of 
1933, 
as 
amended 
(the 
 Puerto 
Rico 
Banking 
Law ), 
requires 
that 
a 
minimum 
of 
10 
of 
 FirstBank s 
net income 
for 
the year 
be transferred 
to a 
legal surplus 
reserve 
until such 
surplus 
equals the 
total of 
paid-in-capital 
on 
 common and preferred 
stock. Amounts transferred 
to the legal surplus 
reserve from retained 
earnings are not available 
for distribution 
 to the Corporation without the 
prior consent of the Puerto 
Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. 
The Puerto Rico Banking 
Law 
 provides that, 
when the 
expenditures of 
a Puerto 
Rico commercial 
bank are 
greater than 
receipts, the 
excess of 
the expenditures 
over 
 receipts 
must 
be 
charged 
against 
the 
undistributed 
profits 
of 
the 
bank, 
and 
the 
balance, 
if 
any, 
must 
be 
charged 
against 
the 
legal 
 surplus 
reserve, 
as 
a 
reduction 
thereof. 
If 
the 
legal 
surplus 
reserve 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
such 
balance 
in 
whole 
or 
in 
part, 
the 
 outstanding 
amount 
must 
be charged 
against 
the 
capital 
account 
and 
the 
Bank 
cannot 
pay 
dividends 
until 
it 
can 
replenish 
the 
legal 
 surplus reserve 
to an 
amount of 
at least 
20 of 
the original 
capital contributed. 
FirstBank s 
legal surplus 
reserve, included 
as part 
of 
 retained 
earnings 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
financial 
condition, 
amounted 
to 
 199.6 
million 
as 
of 
each 
of 
 September 
30, 2024 
and 
December 31, 
2023, 
respectively. 
There 
were no 
transfers to 
the legal 
surplus 
reserve 
during the 
first nine 
 months of 2024.

 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 First 
BanCorp 
manages 
its 
asset/liability 
position 
to 
limit 
the 
effects 
of 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
on 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
to 
 maintain stability 
of profitability 
under varying 
interest rate 
scenarios. The 
MIALCO oversees 
interest rate 
risk and 
monitors, among 
 other things, 
current and expected 
conditions in global 
financial markets, competition 
and prevailing rates 
in the local 
deposit market, 
 liquidity, 
loan 
originations 
pipeline, 
securities 
market 
values, 
recent 
or 
proposed 
changes 
to 
the 
investment 
portfolio, 
alternative 
 funding sources 
and related costs, 
hedging and the 
possible purchase of 
derivatives such as 
swaps and caps, 
and any tax 
or regulatory 
 issues which may be 
pertinent to these areas. 
The MIALCO approves funding 
decisions in light of 
the Corporation s 
overall strategies 
 and objectives. 
 On 
at 
least 
a 
quarterly 
basis, 
the 
Corporation 
performs 
a 
consolidated 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation 
analysis 
to 
estimate 
the 
 potential change 
in future 
earnings from 
projected changes 
in interest 
rates. These 
simulations are 
carried out 
over a 
one-to-five-year 
 time horizon. 
The rate 
scenarios considered 
in these 
simulations reflect 
gradual upward 
or downward 
interest rate 
movements in 
the 
 yield 
curve, 
for 
gradual 
(ramp) 
parallel 
shifts 
in 
the 
yield 
curve 
of 
200 
and 
300 
bps 
during 
a 
twelve-month 
period, 
or 
immediate 
 upward or downward 
changes in interest 
rate movements of 200 
bps, for interest 
rate shock scenarios. 
The Corporation carries 
out the 
 simulations in two ways: 
 (1)
 Using a static balance sheet, as the Corporation had on the simulation date, 
and 
 (2)
 Using a dynamic balance sheet based on recent patterns and current 
strategies. 
 The balance 
sheet is 
divided into 
groups of 
assets and 
liabilities by 
maturity or 
repricing structure 
and their 
corresponding interest 
 yields and 
costs. As interest 
rates rise or 
fall, these 
simulations incorporate 
expected future 
lending rates, 
current and 
expected future 
 funding sources 
and costs, 
the possible 
exercise of 
options, changes 
in prepayment 
rates, deposit 
decay and 
other factors, 
which may 
 be important in projecting net interest income. 

 The 
Corporation 
uses a 
simulation 
model 
to 
project 
future movements 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
balance 
sheet 
and 
income 
statement. 
 The starting 
point of 
the projections 
corresponds to 
the actual 
values on 
the balance 
sheet on 
the simulation 
date. These 
simulations 
 are 
highly 
complex 
and 
are 
based 
on 
many 
assumptions 
that 
are 
intended 
to 
reflect 
the 
general 
behavior 
of 
the 
balance 
sheet 
 components over 
the modeled 
periods. It 
is unlikely 
that actual 
events will 
match these 
assumptions in 
all cases. 
For this 
reason, the 
 results of 
these forward-looking 
computations are 
only approximations 
of the 
sensitivity of 
net interest 
income to 
changes in 
market 
 interest rates. Several 
benchmark and market 
rate curves were used 
in the modeling process, 
primarily, 
SOFR curve, Prime Rate, 
U.S. 
 Treasury yield curve, FHLB rates, brokered 
CDs rates, and repurchase agreements rates. 
 As of September 
30, 2024, the 
Corporation forecasted 
the 12-month net 
interest income assuming 
September 30, 2024 
interest rate 
 curves remain constant. 
Then, net interest income was 
estimated under rising 
and falling rates scenarios. 
For the rising rate 
scenario, a 
 gradual (ramp) 
and immediate 
(shock) parallel 
upward shift 
of the 
yield curve 
is assumed 
during the 
first twelve 
months (the 
 +300 
 ramp , +200 
ramp and 
 +200 shock 
scenarios). Conversely, 
for the 
falling rate 
scenario, a 
gradual (ramp) 
and immediate 
(shock) 
 parallel downward shift 
of the yield 
curve is assumed during 
the first twelve months 
(the -300 ramp , 
 -200 ramp and -200 
shock 
 scenarios). 
 The 
SOFR curve 
for 
September 
30, 2024, 
as compared 
with December 
31, 2023, 
reflects a 
decrease 
of 74 
bps on 
average in 
the 
 short-term 
sector 
of 
the 
curve, 
or 
between 
one 
to 
twelve 
months; 
a 
decrease 
of 
55 
bps 
in 
the 
medium-term 
sector 
of 
the 
curve, 
or 
 between 
2 to 
5 years; 
and 
a decrease 
of 13 
bps 
in the 
long-term 
sector of 
the 
curve, 
or over 
5-year maturities. 
A similar 
change 
in 
 market 
rates 
was 
observed 
in 
the 
Constant 
Maturity 
Treasury 
yield 
curve 
with 
a 
decrease 
of 
76 
bps 
in 
the 
short-term 
sector 
and 
a 
 decrease of 42 bps in the medium-term sector. 
However, the long-term sector of the curve remains practically 
unchanged.

The following table presents the results of the static simulations as of September 30,2024 
and December 31, 2023. Consistent with 
 prior years, these exclude non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives:

 The Corporation 
continues to 
manage its 
balance sheet 
structure to 
control and 
limit the 
overall interest 
rate risk 
by managing 
its 
 asset 
composition 
while 
maintaining 
a 
sound 
liquidity 
position. 
See 
 Risk 
Management 
 
Liquidity 
Risk 
Management 
above 
for 
 liquidity ratios. 

 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, 
the net interest income simulations show that the Corporation continues 
to have 
 an asset sensitive position for the next twelve months under a static balance sheet 
simulation. 
 Under 
gradual 
rising 
and 
falling 
rate 
scenarios, 
the 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation 
shows 
an 
increase 
in 
interest 
rate 
sensitivity, 
 when 
compared 
with December 
31, 
2023, 
due to 
lower sensitivity 
in the 
liabilities 
side 
as a 
result of 
updated 
assumptions. 
Deposit 
 betas 
and 
repricing 
lags 
were 
modified 
for 
some 
deposit 
categories 
to 
reflect 
current 
behavior 
and 
expectations 
under 
current 
and 
 projected interest rate scenarios. 
Also, the sensitivity in the 
liabilities side was impacted by 
higher cost shorter term brokered 
CDs that 
 are either being repriced at lower rates or are not being renewed. 
 Under 
the 
static 
simulation, 
the 
Corporation 
assumes 
that 
maturing 
instruments 
are 
replaced 
with 
similar 
instruments 
at 
the 
 repricing rate upon maturity. 
The Corporation s results may vary 
significantly from the ones presented above under alternative balance 
 sheet compositions, 
such as a 
dynamic balance 
sheet scenario which, 
for example, would 
assume that cash 
flows from the 
investment 
 securities portfolio and loan repayments will be redeployed into higher yielding 
alternatives.

 Credit Risk Management 
 First BanCorp. 
is subject 
to 
credit 
risk 
mainly 
with 
respect 
to 
its portfolio 
of loans 
receivable 
and 
off-balance-sheet 
instruments, 
 principally 
loan 
commitments. 
Loans 
receivable 
represents 
loans 
that 
First 
BanCorp. 
holds 
for 
investment 
and, 
therefore, 
First 
 BanCorp. is at risk for 
the term of the loan. 
Loan commitments represent commitments 
to extend credit, subject 
to specific conditions, 
 for specific amounts 
and maturities. These commitments 
may expose the Corporation 
to credit risk and 
are subject to the 
same review 
 and 
approval 
process as 
for 
loans 
made 
by 
the 
Bank. 
See Risk 
Management 
 
Liquidity 
Risk and 
 Risk Management 
 
Capital 
 above 
for 
further 
details. 
The 
Corporation 
manages 
its 
credit 
risk 
through 
its 
credit 
policy, 
underwriting, 
monitoring 
of 
loan 
 concentrations 
and 
related 
credit 
quality, 
counterparty 
credit 
risk, 
economic 
and 
market 
conditions, 
and 
legislative 
or 
regulatory 
 mandates. The 
Corporation also performs 
independent loan review 
and quality 
control procedures, 
statistical analysis, comprehensive 
 financial 
analysis, 
established 
management 
committees, 
and 
employs 
proactive 
collection 
and 
loss 
mitigation 
efforts. 
Furthermore, 
 personnel 
performing 
structured 
loan 
workout 
functions 
are 
responsible 
for 
mitigating 
defaults 
and 
minimizing 
losses 
upon 
default 
 within each 
region and 
for each business 
segment. In 
the case of 
the C I, commercial 
mortgage and 
construction loan 
portfolios, the 
 Special Asset 
Group SAG 
focuses on 
strategies for 
the accelerated 
reduction 
of non-performing 
assets through 
note sales, 
short 
 sales, loss 
mitigation 
programs, and 
sales of 
OREO. In 
addition 
to the 
management of 
the resolution 
process for 
problem loans, 
the 
 SAG 
oversees 
collection 
efforts 
for 
all 
loans 
to 
prevent 
migration 
to 
the 
nonaccrual 
and/or 
adversely 
classified 
status. 
The 
SAG 
 utilizes relationship officers, collection specialists and attorneys. 
 The 
Corporation 
may 
also 
have 
risk 
of 
default 
in 
the 
securities 
portfolio. 
The 
securities 
held 
by 
the 
Corporation 
are 
principally 
 fixed-rate U.S. agencies 
MBS and U.S. Treasury 
and agencies securities. Thus, 
a substantial portion 
of these instruments is 
backed by 
 mortgages, a guarantee of a U.S. GSE or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. 
 Management, consisting of the Corporation s 
Chief Risk Officer, 
Commercial Credit Risk Officer, 
Retail Credit Risk Officer, 
Chief 
 Credit Officer, 
and other senior executives, 
has the primary responsibility 
for setting strategies to achieve 
the Corporation s 
credit risk 
 goals and objectives. Management has documented these goals and objectives 
in the Corporation s Credit Policy. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses and Non-Performing Assets 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans and 
Finance Leases 
 The ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases represents 
the estimate 
of the 
level of 
reserves appropriate 
to absorb 
expected credit 
losses 
 over the estimated life of 
the loans. The amount of the allowance 
is determined using relevant available 
information, from internal and 
 external sources, relating 
to past events, current 
conditions, and reasonable 
and supportable forecasts. 
Historical credit loss experience 
 is 
a 
significant 
input 
for 
the 
estimation 
of 
expected 
credit 
losses, 
as 
well 
as 
adjustments 
to 
historical 
loss 
information 
made 
for 
 differences in current loan-specific 
risk characteristics, such as differences 
in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, 
delinquency level, 
 or 
term. 
Additionally, 
the 
Corporation s 
assessment 
involves 
evaluating 
key 
factors, 
which 
include 
credit 
and 
macroeconomic 
 indicators, 
such as 
changes in 
unemployment 
rates, property 
values, and 
other relevant 
factors to 
account for 
current and 
forecasted 
 market conditions 
that are 
likely to 
cause estimated 
credit losses 
over the 
life of the 
loans to differ 
from historical 
credit losses. 
Such 
 factors are 
subject to 
regular review 
and may 
change to 
reflect updated 
performance trends 
and expectations, 
particularly in 
times of 
 severe 
stress. 
The 
process 
includes 
judgments 
and 
quantitative 
elements 
that 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
significant 
change. 
Further, 
the 
 Corporation periodically considers the need for 
qualitative reserves to the ACL. Qualitative adjustments may be 
related to and include, 
 but are 
not limited 
to, factors 
such as 
the following: 
(i) management s 
assessment of 
economic forecasts 
used in 
the model 
and how 
 those 
forecasts 
align 
with 
management s 
overall 
evaluation 
of 
current 
and 
expected 
economic 
conditions; 
(ii) 
organization 
specific 
 risks such 
as credit 
concentrations, 
collateral 
specific risks, 
nature 
and 
size of 
the portfolio 
and 
external 
factors that 
may 
ultimately 
 impact credit quality, 
and (iii) other 
limitations associated with 
factors such as 
changes in underwriting 
and loan resolution 
strategies, 
 among others. 
The ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases is 
reviewed at 
least on 
a quarterly 
basis as 
part of 
the Corporation s 
continued 
 evaluation of its asset quality. 
 
The Corporation 
generally applies 
probability weights 
to the 
baseline and 
alternative downside 
economic scenarios 
to estimate 
 the ACL with the 
baseline scenario carrying 
the highest weight. The 
scenarios that are chosen 
each quarter and the 
weighting given to 
 each 
scenario 
for 
the 
different 
loan 
portfolio 
categories 
depend 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
factors 
including 
recent 
economic 
events, 
leading 
 national 
and regional 
economic indicators, 
and industry 
trends. As 
of September 
30, 2024 
and December 
31, 2023, 
the Corporation 
 applied 
100 
probability 
to 
the 
baseline 
scenario 
for 
the 
commercial 
mortgage 
and 
construction 
loan 
portfolios 
since 
certain 
 macroeconomic 
variables 
associated 
with 
commercial 
real estate 
property 
performance 
and 
the CRE 
price 
index, 
particularly 
in the 
 Puerto Rico region, 
are expected to continue 
to perform in a 
more favorable manner 
than the alternative 
downside economic scenario. 
 The 
economic 
scenarios 
used 
in 
the 
ACL 
determination 
contained 
assumptions 
related 
to 
economic 
uncertainties 
associated 
with 
 geopolitical instability, 
the CRE 
price index, 
unemployment rate, 
inflation levels, 
and expected 
future interest 
rate adjustments 
in the 
 Federal Reserve Board s funds rate.

As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Corporation s 
ACL model 
considered the 
following assumptions 
for key 
economic variables 
in 
 the probability-weighted economic scenarios: 
 
 CRE 
price 
index 
at 
the 
national 
level 
with 
an 
average 
projected 
contraction 
of 
4.00 
for 
the 
remainder 
of 
2024 
and 
an 
 average 
projected 
appreciation of 
0.92 for 
the year 
2025, compared 
to an 
average projected 
contraction 
of 6.24 
for the 
 remainder of 2024 and an average projected appreciation of 2.01 
for the year 2025 as of December 31, 2023. 

Regional 
Home 
Price 
Index 
forecast 
in 
Puerto 
Rico 
(purchase 
only 
prices) 
is 
projected 
to 
remain 
relatively 
flat 
for 
the 
 remainder of 2024, 
while for the 
year 2025 shows 
a deterioration of 
1.48 , when compared 
to the same 
period projection as 
 of December 31, 2023. For the Florida region, 
the Home Price Index forecast shows an improvement 
of 8.50 and 7.05 for 
 the remainder of 2024 and for the year 2025, respectively, 
when compared to the same period as of December 31, 2023. 

Average 
regional unemployment rate 
in Puerto Rico is 
forecasted at 6.07 
for the remainder 
of 2024 and 6.30 
for the year 
 2025, 
compared to 
7.68 for 
the remainder 
of 2024 
and 8.08 
for the 
year 2025 
as of December 
31, 2023. 
For the 
Florida 
 and 
the 
U.S. 
mainland, 
average 
unemployment 
rate 
is 
forecasted 
at 
3.94 
and 
4.45 , 
respectively, 
for 
the 
remainder 
of 
 2024, and 
4.51 and 4.96 , 
respectively, 
for the year 
2025, compared 
to 4.51 
and 4.94 , 
respectively, 
for the remainder 
 of 2024, and 4.12 
and 4.52 , respectively, for 
the year 2025 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Annualized change in 
GDP in the U.S. 
mainland of 1.69 for 
the remainder of 2024 
and 1.04 
for the year 2025, 
compared 
 to 0.53 
for the remainder of 2024 and 1.64 
for the year 2025 as of December 31, 2023. 
 It is difficult to estimate how potential changes 
in one factor or input might affect the overall ACL because 
management considers a 
 wide variety of 
factors and inputs in 
estimating the ACL. 
Changes in the 
factors and inputs considered 
may not occur 
at the same rate 
 and may not be consistent 
across all geographies or product 
types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally 
inconsistent, 
 such that improvement 
in one factor 
or input may 
offset deterioration 
in others. However, 
to demonstrate the 
sensitivity of credit 
loss 
 estimates to macroeconomic 
forecasts as of 
September 30, 2024, 
management compared the 
modeled estimates under 
the probability-
 weighted 
economic 
scenarios 
against 
a 
more 
adverse 
scenario. 
Such 
scenario 
incorporates 
an 
additional 
adverse 
scenario 
and 
 decreases the 
weight applied 
to the 
baseline scenario. 
Under this 
more adverse 
scenario, as 
an example, 
average unemployment 
rate 
 for the 
Puerto Rico 
region increases 
to 6.33 
for the 
remainder of 
2024, compared 
to 6.07 
for the 
same period 
on the 
probability-
 weighted economic scenario projections. 
 To 
demonstrate the sensitivity 
to key economic 
parameters used in 
the calculation of 
the ACL at September 
30, 2024, management 
 calculated 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
quantitative 
ACL 
and 
this 
more 
adverse 
scenario. 
Excluding 
consideration 
of 
qualitative 
 adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical 
increase in the ACL of approximately 40 million at September 
30, 
 2024. 
This analysis 
relates only 
to the 
modeled credit 
loss estimates 
and is 
not intended 
to estimate 
changes in 
the overall 
ACL as 
it 
 does 
not 
reflect 
any 
potential 
changes 
in 
other 
adjustments 
to 
the 
qualitative 
calculation, 
which 
would 
also 
be 
influenced 
by 
the 
 judgment 
management 
applies 
to 
the 
modeled 
lifetime 
loss 
estimates 
to 
reflect 
the 
uncertainty 
and 
imprecision 
of 
these 
estimates 
 based 
on 
current 
circumstances 
and 
conditions. 
Recognizing 
that 
forecasts 
of 
macroeconomic 
conditions 
are 
inherently 
uncertain, 
 particularly in 
light of 
recent economic 
conditions and 
challenges, which 
continue to 
evolve, management 
believes that 
its process 
to 
 consider the 
available information 
and associated 
risks and 
uncertainties is 
appropriately governed 
and that 
its estimates 
of expected 
 credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended 
September 30, 2024. 
 As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
ACL for 
loans and 
finance leases 
was 247.0 
million, or 
1.98 of 
total loans, 
a decrease 
of 14.8 
 million, from 261.8 
million, or 2.15 of 
total loans, as of 
December 31, 2023. The 
ACL for residential mortgage 
loans decreased by 
 16.7 million, driven by updated 
historical loss experience used for determining 
the ACL estimate resulting in a 
downward revision of 
 estimated loss severities 
and improvements 
in the long-term 
projections of 
the unemployment rate 
in the Puerto 
Rico region, partially 
 offset 
by newly 
originated loans. 
The ACL 
for commercial 
and construction 
loans decreased 
by 8.8 
million, mainly 
due to 
reserve 
 releases associated with the improved financial condition 
of certain borrowers and an improvement on the economic 
outlook of certain 
 macroeconomic variables, 
particularly variables 
associated with commercial 
real estate property 
performance and 
the forecasted CRE 
 price index, particularly in the Puerto Rico region, partially offset 
by increased volume. 

 Meanwhile, the 
ACL for 
consumer loans 
increased by 
 10.7 million 
driven by 
higher charge-off 
levels and 
loan portfolio 
growth, 
 mainly in auto loans. 
 The ratio 
of the ACL 
for loans and 
finance leases 
to total 
loans held 
for investment 
decreased to 
1.98 
as of September 
30, 2024, 
 compared to 2.15 as of December 31, 2023. An explanation for the change 
for each portfolio follows: 
 
 The ACL to total 
loans ratio for the 
residential mortgage loan 
portfolio decreased from 
2.03 as of December 
31, 2023 to 
 1.44 as 
of September 
30, 2024, 
mainly due 
to the 
aforementioned updated 
historical loss 
experience and 
improvements 
 in the long-term projections of the unemployment rate, partially offset 
by the aforementioned newly originated loans. 

114
 
 The ACL 
to total 
loans ratio 
for the construction 
loan portfolio 
decreased from 
2.61 as 
of December 
31, 2023 
to 1.93 
 as of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
mainly 
due 
to an 
improvement 
on 
the 
economic 
outlook 
of 
certain 
macroeconomic 
variables 
 associated with commercial real estate property performance and the 
CRE price index. 

The ACL 
to total 
loans ratio 
for the 
commercial mortgage 
loan portfolio 
decreased from 
1.41 as 
of December 
31, 2023 
 to 0.98 
as of September 
30, 2024, driven 
by the 
aforementioned reserve 
releases associated 
with the 
improved financial 
 condition 
of 
certain 
borrowers 
and 
an 
improvement 
on 
the 
economic 
outlook 
of 
certain 
macroeconomic 
variables 
 associated with commercial real estate property performance and the 
CRE price index. 
 
 The 
ACL 
to 
total 
loans 
ratio 
for 
the 
C I 
loan 
portfolio 
remained 
relatively 
flat 
at 
1.07 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
 compared to 1.05 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The ACL 
to total 
loans ratio 
for the 
consumer loan 
portfolio increased 
from 3.64 
as of December 
31, 2023 
to 3.84 as 
 of September 30, 2024, driven by increases in charge-off 
levels. 
 
The ratio 
of the 
total ACL 
for loans 
and finance 
leases to 
nonaccrual loans 
held for 
investment was 
276.46 
as of 
September 30, 
 2024, 
compared to 312.81 as of December 31, 2023.

 Allowance for Credit Losses for Unfunded 
Loan Commitments
 The Corporation estimates 
expected credit losses 
over the contractual 
period in which 
the Corporation is 
exposed to credit 
risk as a 
 result 
of 
a 
contractual 
obligation 
to 
extend 
credit, 
such as 
pursuant 
to unfunded 
loan 
commitments 
and 
standby 
letters of 
credit 
for 
 commercial and 
construction loans, 
unless the 
obligation is 
unconditionally cancellable 
by the 
Corporation. The 
ACL for 
off-balance 
 sheet 
credit 
exposures 
is 
adjusted 
as 
a 
provision 
for 
credit 
loss 
expense. 
As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
ACL 
for 
off-balance 
sheet 
 credit exposures 
decreased by 
 1.1 million 
to 3.5 
million, when 
compared to 
December 31, 
2023, driven 
by an 
improvement on 
the 
 economic outlook of certain macroeconomic variables, particularly 
in variables associated with the CRE price index. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Held-to-Maturity 
Debt Securities
 As of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the ACL 
for 
held-to-maturity 
securities 
portfolio 
was entirely 
related 
to 
financing 
arrangements 
with 
 Puerto 
Rico 
municipalities 
issued 
in 
bond 
form, 
which 
the 
Corporation 
accounts 
for 
as 
securities, 
but 
which 
were 
underwritten 
as 
 loans 
with 
features 
that 
are 
typically 
found 
in 
commercial 
loans. 
As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
ACL 
for 
held-to-maturity 
debt 
 securities 
was 
 1.1 
million, 
compared 
to 
 2.2 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023. 
The 
decrease 
was 
driven 
by 
improvements 
in 
the 
 underlying updated financial information of a Puerto Rico municipal 
bond issuer. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Available 
-for-Sale Debt Securities 
 
The 
ACL 
for 
available-for-sale 
debt 
securities, 
which 
is 
associated 
with 
private 
label 
MBS 
and 
a 
residential 
pass-through 
MBS 
 issued by the PRHFA, was 0.5 
million as of each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Nonaccrual Loans and Non-Performing Assets 
 Total 
non-performing 
assets consist 
of nonaccrual 
loans (generally 
loans held 
for 
investment or 
loans held 
for 
sale for 
which 
the 
 recognition of 
interest income 
was discontinued 
when the 
loan became 
90 days 
past due 
or earlier 
if the 
full and 
timely collection 
of 
 interest or principal 
is uncertain), foreclosed 
real estate and 
other repossessed properties, 
and non-performing 
investment securities, if 
 any. 
When a 
loan is placed 
in nonaccrual 
status, any 
interest previously 
recognized and 
not collected 
is reversed 
and charged 
against 
 interest 
income. 
Cash 
payments 
received 
are 
recognized 
when 
collected 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
contractual 
terms 
of 
the 
loans. 
The 
 principal 
portion 
of the 
payment is 
used to 
reduce 
the principal 
balance 
of the 
loan, 
whereas the 
interest portion 
is recognized 
on a 
 cash basis 
(when collected). 
However, 
when management 
believes that 
the ultimate 
collectability of 
principal is 
in doubt, 
the interest 
 portion 
is 
applied 
to 
the 
outstanding 
principal. 
The 
risk 
exposure 
of 
this 
portfolio 
is 
diversified 
as 
to 
individual 
borrowers 
and 
 industries, among other factors. In addition, a large portion 
is secured with real estate collateral.

 Nonaccrual Loans Policy
 Residential Real Estate Loans
 
 The Corporation generally classifies real estate loans in 
nonaccrual status when it has not received 
 interest and principal for a period of 90 days or more. 
 Commercial

Construction 
Loans

The 
Corporation 
classifies

loans 
(including 
commercial 
real 
estate 
and 
 construction loans) in nonaccrual 
status when it has not 
received interest and principal 
for a period of 90 
days or more or when 
it does 
 not expect to collect all of the principal or interest due to deterioration in the financial 
condition of the borrower. 
 Finance Leases
 
 The Corporation 
classifies finance leases 
in nonaccrual status 
when it has 
not received interest 
and principal for 
 a period of 90 days or more. 
 Consumer Loans
 
 The Corporation 
classifies consumer 
loans in nonaccrual 
status when it 
has not received 
interest and 
principal 
 for a period of 90 days or more. Credit card loans continue to accrue finance 
charges and fees until charged-off at 180 
days delinquent. 
 Purchased 
Credit Deteriorated 
Loans PCD 
 For 
PCD loans, 
the nonaccrual 
status is 
determined in 
the same 
manner as 
for 
 other loans, 
except for 
PCD loans 
that prior 
to the 
adoption of 
CECL were 
classified as 
purchased credit 
impaired PCI 
loans and 
 accounted 
for 
under 
ASC 
Subtopic 
310-30, 
 Receivables 
 
Loans 
and 
Debt 
Securities 
Acquired 
with 
Deteriorated 
Credit 
Quality 
 ASC 
Subtopic 
310-30 ). 
As 
allowed 
by 
CECL, 
the 
Corporation 
elected 
to 
maintain 
pools 
of 
loans 
accounted 
for 
under 
ASC 
 Subtopic 310-30 
as units 
of accounts, 
conceptually treating 
each pool 
as a 
single asset. 
Regarding interest 
income recognition, 
the 
 prospective 
transition 
approach 
for 
PCD loans 
was applied 
at 
a 
pool 
level, which 
froze 
the 
effective 
interest 
rate of 
the pools 
as of 
 January 
1, 2020. 
According 
to regulatory 
guidance, 
the determination 
of nonaccrual 
or accrual 
status for 
PCD loans 
with respect 
to 
 which the Corporation has made 
a policy election to maintain 
previously existing pools upon adoption 
of CECL should be made at 
the 
 pool level, not the individual 
asset level. In addition, the guidance 
provides that the Corporation can 
continue accruing interest and 
not 
 report 
the PCD 
loans as 
being 
in nonaccrual 
status if 
the following 
criteria are 
met: (i) 
the Corporation 
can reasonably 
estimate the 
 timing and amounts of 
cash flows expected to 
be collected; and (ii) 
the Corporation did not 
acquire the asset primarily 
for the rewards 
 of ownership 
of the 
underlying collateral, 
such as 
the use 
in operations 
or improving 
the collateral 
for resale. 
Thus, the 
Corporation 
 continues to exclude these pools of PCD loans from nonaccrual loan 
statistics. 
 Loans Past-Due 
90 Days 
and Still 
Accruing 
 These 
are accruing 
loans that 
are contractually 
delinquent 90 
days or 
more. These 
 past-due 
loans 
are 
either 
current 
as 
to 
interest 
but 
delinquent 
as 
to 
the 
payment 
of 
principal 
(i.e., 
well 
secured 
and 
in 
process 
of 
 collection) 
or 
are 
insured 
or 
guaranteed 
under 
applicable 
FHA, 
VA, 
or 
other 
government-guaranteed 
programs 
for 
residential 
 mortgage loans. 
Furthermore, as required 
by instructions in 
regulatory reports, 
loans past due 
90 days and 
still accruing include 
loans 
 previously pooled into 
GNMA securities for which 
the Corporation has the 
option but not the 
obligation to repurchase loans 
that meet 
 GNMA s 
specified 
delinquency 
criteria 
(e.g., 
borrowers 
fail 
to 
make 
any 
payment 
for 
three 
consecutive 
months). 
For 
accounting 
 purposes, these GNMA loans subject 
to the repurchase option are 
required to be reflected in the 
financial statements with an offsetting 
 liability. 
In addition, 
loans past due 
90 days 
and still accruing 
include PCD 
loans, as 
mentioned above, 
and credit 
cards that 
continue 
 accruing interest until charged-off 
at 180 days. 
 Other Real Estate Owned

 obtained periodically, 
generally on an annual basis. 
 Other Repossessed Property
 The 
other 
repossessed 
property 
category 
generally 
includes repossessed 
autos 
acquired 
in settlement 
of 
loans. 
Repossessed 
autos 
 are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. 
 Other Non-Performing Assets
 This 
category

pass-through 
MBS 
issued 
by 
the 
PRHFA placed 
in 
non-performing 
status 
in 
the 
second 
 quarter of 2021 based on the delinquency status of the underlying second 
mortgage loans.

 Includes PCD loans previously 
accounted for under ASC Subtopic 
310-30 for which the 
Corporation made the accounting 
policy election of maintaining pools 
of loans as units of 
account both at 
 the time 
of adoption 
of CECL 
on January 
1, 2020 
and on 
an ongoing 
basis for 
credit loss 
measurement. These 
loans will 
continue to 
be excluded 
from nonaccrual 
loan statistics 
as long 
as the 
 Corporation can reasonably estimate 
the timing and 
amount of cash flows 
expected to be 
collected on the 
loan pools. The portion 
of such loans 
contractually past due 90 
days or more 
amounted to 
 6.5 million and 8.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (3) 
 Includes FHA/VA 
government-guaranteed residential 
mortgage as 
loans past-due 
90 days 
and still 
accruing as 
opposed to 
nonaccrual loans. 
The Corporation 
continues accruing 
interest on 
these 
 loans 
until 
they 
have 
passed 
the 
15 
months delinquency 
mark, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
FHA 
interest 
curtailment 
process. 
These 
balances 
include 
 9.0 
million 
and 
 15.4 
million of 
FHA 
 government guaranteed residential mortgage loans that were over 15 months delinquent as of September 30, 2024 and 
December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (4) 
 These includes 
rebooked loans, 
which were 
previously pooled into 
GNMA securities, 
amounting to 
 6.6 million 
and 7.9 
million as 
of September 30, 
2024 and 
December 31, 
2023, respectively. 
 Under the GNMA program, the Corporation 
has the option but not 
the obligation to repurchase loans 
that meet GNMA s 
specified delinquency criteria. For 
accounting purposes, the loans subject to 
 the repurchase option are required to be reflected on the financial statements with an offsetting liability.

 Total 
non-performing assets 
decreased by 
 6.8 million 
to 119.1 
million as of 
September 30, 
2024, compared 
to 125.9 million 
as 
 of December 
31, 2023. The 
decrease in non-performing 
assets was driven 
by a 13.3 
million decrease in 
the OREO portfolio 
balance 
 in 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
region, 
mainly 
attributable 
to 
the 
sale 
of 
a 
 5.3 
million 
commercial 
real 
estate 
OREO 
property 
and 
sales 
of 
 residential OREO properties, partially offset by a 5.6 
million increase in total nonaccrual loans held for investment. 
 Total 
nonaccrual 
loans 
were 
 89.3 
million 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024. 
This 
represents 
a 
net 
increase 
of 
 5.6 
million 
from 
 83.7 
 million as 
of December 
31, 2023, 
mainly in 
commercial and 
construction loans, 
driven by 
the inflow 
of a 
 16.5 million 
commercial 
 relationship in the 
Puerto Rico region 
in the food retail 
industry, 
partially offset by 
the sale of 
an 8.2 million 
nonaccrual C I loan 
in 
 the Puerto Rico region. The sale resulted in a 1.2 million charge 
-off that had been previously reserved.

 The amount of nonaccrual 
consumer loans, including finance 
leases, increased by 0.7 
million to 23.1 million 
as of September 30, 
 2024, 
compared to 
 22.4 million 
as of December 
31, 2023. 
The increase 
was mainly 
reflected in 
the auto loan 
portfolio. The 
inflows 
 of nonaccrual 
consumer loans 
during the 
first nine 
months of 
2024 amounted 
to 86.6 
million, compared 
to inflows 
of 63.2 
million 
 for the same period in 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 
approximately 24.3 million of 
the loans placed in nonaccrual status, 
mainly commercial and residential 
 mortgage loans, were current, 
or had delinquencies of 
less than 90 days in their 
interest payments. 
Collections on nonaccrual loans 
are 
 being recorded on a cash basis through earnings, or on a cost-recovery basis, as conditions 
warrant. 

 During the nine-month period ended 
September 30, 2024, interest income of 
approximately 0.6 million related to 
nonaccrual loans 
 with a 
carrying value 
of 30.9 
million as 
of September 
30, 2024, 
mainly nonaccrual 
commercial and 
construction loans, 
was applied 
 against the related principal balances under the cost-recovery method. 
 Total loans in early 
delinquency i.e.
 , 30-89 days past due loans, as defined in regulatory reporting 
instructions) amounted to 143.4 
 million as of September 
30, 2024, a decrease of 
 7.4 million, compared to 
 150.8 million as of December 
31, 2023. 
The variances by 
 major portfolio categories are as follows: 

Consumer loans in early delinquency decreased by 8.1 million to 103.9 
million, mainly reflected in the auto loan portfolio. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans in early delinquency decreased by 4.6 
million to 31.9 million. 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 Commercial 
and 
construction 
loans 
in 
early 
delinquency 
increased 
by 
 5.3 
million 
to 
 7.6 
million, 
mainly 
due 
to 
certain 
 commercial loans 
that matured 
and are 
in the 
process of 
renewal but 
for which 
the Corporation 
continues to 
receive interest 
 and principal payments from the borrowers. 
 In addition, 
the Corporation 
provides 
homeownership 
preservation 
assistance to 
its customers 
through 
a loss 
mitigation 
program. 
 Depending

For

nine-month 
period 
ended 
September 30,

loans modified

difficulty 
had 
an 
 amortized 
cost 
basis 
of 
 6.8

The

include 
 110.7 million

commercial mortgage relationship

 Net Charge-offs and Total 
Credit Losses 
 
Net charge-offs 
totaled 24.0 
million for 
the third 
quarter of 
2024, 
or 0.78 of 
average loans 
on an annualized 
basis, compared 
to 
 14.1 million, or 
an annualized 0.48 
of average loans, 
for the third quarter 
of 2023. For the 
nine-month period ended 
September 30, 
 2024, 
net 
charge-offs 
totaled 
 56.2 
million, 
or 
an 
annualized 
0.61 
of 
average 
loans, 
compared 
to 46.6 
million, 
or an 
annualized 
 0.54 of 
average loans, 
for the 
same period 
in 2023.
 Net charge-offs 
for the 
nine-month period 
ended September 
30, 2024 
include a 
 10.0 
million 
recovery 
associated 
with 
the 
bulk 
sale 
of 
fully 
charged-off 
consumer 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases, 
which 
reduced 
by 
11 
 basis points the ratio of total net charge-offs to 
average loans for such period. 
 Consumer 
loans 
and 
finance 
leases 
net 
charge-offs 
for 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024 
were 
 23.0 
million, 
or 
an 
annualized 
2.47 
of 
 related 
average 
loans, 
compared 
to 
net 
charge-offs 
of 
 15.8 
million, 
or 
an 
annualized 
1.79 
of 
related 
average

of 
related 
 average loans, for 
the same period 
in 2023. The 
increase for the third 
quarter and first 
nine months of 
2024 was driven 
by an increase 
 in charge-offs 
across all major portfolio classes, which have been 
trending higher towards historical loss experience, partially 
offset by 
 the 
aforementioned 
recovery 
associated 
with 
the 
aforementioned 
bulk 
sale, 
which 
reduced 
by 
36 basis

 Operational Risk 
 The 
Corporation 
faces 
ongoing 
and 
emerging 
risk 
and 
regulatory 
pressure 
related 
to 
the 
activities 
that 
surround 
the 
delivery 
of 
 banking 
and 
financial 
products. 
Coupled 
with 
external 
influences, 
such 
as 
market 
conditions, 
security 
risks, 
and 
legal 
risks, 
the 
 potential for 
operational and 
reputational loss 
has increased. 
To 
mitigate and 
control operational 
risk, the 
Corporation has 
developed, 
 and continues 
to enhance, specific 
internal controls, 
policies and procedures 
that are designed 
to identify and 
manage operational risk 
 at 
appropriate 
levels 
throughout 
the 
organization. 
The 
purpose 
of 
these 
mechanisms 
is 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
that 
the 
 Corporation s business operations 
are functioning within the policies and limits established by management.
 The 
Corporation 
classifies operational 
risk 
into 
two 
major 
categories: 
business-specific 
and 
corporate-wide 
affecting 
all business 
 lines. For business specific risks, 
Enterprise Risk Management 
works with the various 
business units to ensure consistency 
in policies, 
 processes 
and 
assessments. 
With 
respect 
to 
corporate-wide 
risks, 
such 
as 
information 
security, 
business 
recovery, 
and 
legal 
and 
 compliance, 
the 
Corporation 
has 
specialized 
groups, 
such 
as 
the 
Legal 
Department, 
Information 
Security, 
Corporate 
Compliance, 
 Operations and Enterprise 
Risk Management. These 
groups assist the lines 
of business in 
the development and 
implementation of risk 
 management practices specific to the needs of the business groups.
 Legal and Compliance Risk 
 Legal and compliance risk includes 
the risk of noncompliance with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements, the 
risk of adverse 
 legal 
judgments 
against 
the 
Corporation, 
and 
the 
risk 
that 
a 
counterparty s 
performance 
obligations 
will 
be 
unenforceable. 
The 
 Corporation 
is 
subject 
to 
extensive 
regulation 
in 
the 
different 
jurisdictions 
in 
which 
it 
conducts 
its 
business, 
and 
this 
regulatory 
 scrutiny has 
been significantly 
increasing over 
the years. 
The Corporation 
has established, 
and continues 
to enhance, 
procedures that 
 are designed 
to ensure 
compliance with 
all applicable 
statutory, 
regulatory 
and any 
other legal 
requirements. 
The Corporation 
has a 
 Compliance 
Director 
who 
reports 
to 
the 
Chief 
Risk 
Officer 
and 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
oversight 
of 
regulatory 
compliance 
and 
 implementation 
of an 
enterprise-wide compliance 
risk assessment 
process. 
The Compliance 
division 
has officer 
roles in 
each major 
 business area with direct reporting responsibilities to the Corporate Compliance 
Group. 
 Concentration Risk 
 The Corporation conducts 
its operations in 
a geographically concentrated 
area, as its main 
market is Puerto 
Rico. Of the 
total gross 
 loan portfolio held 
for investment of 
 12.4 billion as 
of September 30, 
2024, the Corporation 
had credit risk 
of approximately 80 
in 
 the Puerto Rico region, 17 in the United States region, and 3 in the 
Virgin Islands region. 
 Update on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Situation 
 A significant 
portion 
of the 
Corporation s 
business activities 
and credit 
exposure 
is concentrated 
in the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto 
 Rico, which 
has experienced 
economic 
and fiscal 
distress over 
the last 
decade. See 
 Risk Management 
 Exposure 
to Puerto 
Rico 
 Government 
below. 
Since 
declaring 
bankruptcy 
and 
benefitting 
from 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
federal 
Puerto 
Rico 
Oversight, 
 Management and Economic Stability Act PROMESA 
in 2016, the Government of Puerto Rico has made 
progress on fiscal matters 
 primarily 
by restructuring 
a large 
portion of 
its outstanding 
public debt 
and identifying 
funding 
sources for 
its underfunded 
pension 
 system. 
 Economic Indicators 
 On March 
18, 2024, 
the Puerto 
Rico Planning 
Board PRPB 
published 
an analysis 
of the 
Puerto Rico s 
economy during 
fiscal 
 year 2023, as well as a 
short-term forecast for fiscal years 
2024 and 2025. According to 
the preliminary estimates issued by the 
PRPB, 
 Puerto Rico s 
real gross 
national product GNP grew 
by 0.7 
in fiscal 
year 2023, 
the third 
consecutive year 
with a positive 
year-
 over-year 
variance. 
The 
main 
drivers 
behind 
growth 
in 
fiscal 
year 
2023 
were 
personal 
consumption 
expenditures 
and 
fixed 
 investments 
in 
both 
construction, 
and 
machinery 
and 
equipment. 
The 
PRPB 
also 
revised 
previously 
published 
real 
GNP 
growth 
 estimates for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 from 3.7 to 3.8 and from 0.9 
to 1.4 , respectively. 

 There 
are 
other 
indicators 
that 
gauge 
economic 
activity 
and 
are 
published 
with 
greater 
frequency, 
for 
example, 
the 
Economic 
 Development 
Bank 
for 
Puerto 
Rico s 
Economic 
Activity 
Index EDB-EAI ). 
Although 
not 
a 
direct 
measure 
of 
Puerto 
Rico s 
real 
 GNP, 
the EDB-EAI 
is correlated 
to Puerto 
Rico s 
real GNP. 
For August 
2024, 
estimates showed 
that the 
EDB-EAI 
stood 
at 126.9, 
 down 0.8 
on a 
year-over-year 
basis. Over 
the 12-month 
period ended 
August 31, 
2024, the 
EDB-EAI averaged 
126.5, 1.0 
above 
 the comparable figure a year earlier. 

126
 Labor market trends remain 
positive. Data published 
by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics showed that 
non-farm payrolls in September 
 2024 in Puerto 
Rico increased by 
1.6 when compared 
to September 2023, 
primarily driven by 
payrolls in the 
private sector as 
these 
 increased by 
2.2 from 
the comparable 
figure a 
year earlier. 
Key industries 
driving private-sector 
payroll growth 
include Leisure 
 
 Hospitality 
with 
a 
year-over-year 
increase 
of 
6.5 
and 
Construction 
with 
a 
positive 
variance 
of 
5.0 . 
The 
unemployment 
rate 
 continued to trend in the right direction to a record-low level of 5.5 in 
September 2024. 
 Fiscal Plan 

On June 
5, 2024, 
the PROMESA 
oversight board 
certified the 
2024 Fiscal 
Plan for 
Puerto Rico 
(the 2024 
Fiscal Plan ), 
updated 
 with 
the 
most 
recent 
data 
and 
projections 
for 
revenues 
and 
expenses, 
and 
renewed 
roadmap 
for 
Puerto 
Rico 
to 
achieve 
fiscal 
 responsibility. 
The 2024 
Fiscal Plan is 
made up 
of four 
parts: (i) progress 
made in stabilizing 
government finances, 
(ii) Puerto 
Rico s 
 current financial 
conditions and 
risks, (iii) details 
of the actions 
required to 
achieve fiscal 
responsibility and 
adequate access 
to credit 
 markets, and 
(iv) description 
of the 
actions the 
PROMESA oversight 
board and 
the Government must 
take to complete 
PROMESA s 
 mandate. 

 The 2024 
Fiscal Plan 
outlines 
eight areas 
of focus 
to achieve 
long-term 
fiscal responsibility: 
(i) improved 
economic 
and revenue 
 forecasting, 
(ii) 
adoption 
of 
budget 
best 
practices, 
(iii) 
comprehensive 
capital 
delivery 
program, 
(iv) 
improved 
management 
of 
 education 
resources, 
(v) 
improved 
government 
service 
delivery 
and 
labor 
relations, 
(vi) 
outcome-based, 
data-driven, 
and 
controlled 
 healthcare 
spending, 
(vii) 
improved, 
transparent 
financial 
reporting, 
and 
(viii) 
optimized 
municipal 
fiscal 
management. 
Success 
in 
 these areas, which 
aim to address 
the most crucial 
financial management 
challenges that Puerto 
Rico faces, is 
critical for 
Puerto Rico 
 to fully recover from bankruptcy and to fulfill the mandate of PROMESA to achieve 
fiscal responsibility. 
 As the 
debt restructurings 
come to 
an end, 
a significant 
portion of 
the uncertainty 
that has 
plagued the 
economy over 
the past 
ten 
 years has 
faded away. 
To 
generate revenues 
that are 
resilient even 
when the 
unprecedented influx 
of federal 
funding subsides, 
fiscal 
 stability alone 
will not 
suffice. The 
2024 Fiscal 
Plan describes 
an effort 
to develop 
an integrated 
plan that 
will serve 
as a 
roadmap to 
 unlock 
future 
growth. 
While 
that 
plan 
is 
developed, 
the 
PROMESA 
oversight 
board 
and 
the 
Government 
will 
continue 
to 
support 
 specific priorities 
through a first 
wave of economic 
growth initiatives that 
aim to address 
the most crucial 
challenges that Puerto 
Rico 
 faces. 
The 
list 
of 
focus 
areas 
outlined 
in 
the 
2024 
Fiscal 
Plan 
to 
promote 
economic 
growth 
include: 
(i) 
integrated 
framework 
for 
 economic 
growth, 
(ii) 
human 
capital, 
focused 
on 
robust, 
highly-skilled, 
and 
health 
workforce, 
(iii) 
economic 
strategies, 
focused 
on 
 improved 
ease 
of 
doing 
business, 
(iv) 
economic 
policies, 
focused 
on 
reforms 
of 
Puerto 
Rico s 
tax 
system, 
and 
(v) 
infrastructure, 
 focused on reduced cost and increased reliability of energy, 
transportation, and internet connectivity. 

 Similar to 
previous 
fiscal plans, 
the 2024 
Fiscal Plan 
includes 
an updated 
macroeconomic forecast 
reflecting 
the impact 
of fiscal 
 and 
structural 
measures, 
natural disasters, 
COVID-19, 
and 
federal 
funding 
in response 
to natural 
disasters 
and 
the 
pandemic 
on the 
 baseline 
economic 
trajectory. 
The 
2024 
Fiscal 
Plan 
projects 
Puerto 
Rico 
GNP 
growth 
in 
fiscal 
year 
2024 
to 
be 
1.0 , 
followed 
by 
 declines of 0.8 and 
0.1 in fiscal year 
2025 and fiscal year 
2026, respectively. 
On average, Puerto Rico s 
GNP is projected 
to grow 
 approximately 0.4 
between fiscal 
year 2023 
and fiscal 
year 2026. 
Contrary to 
previous fiscal 
plans where 
Puerto Rico s 
population 
 was projected to decline, 
the 2024 Fiscal Plan includes 
a stable population projection 
through 2029 mainly due to 
the offset between 
a 
 negative 
natural 
population 
decline 
and 
positive 
net 
migration. 
Specifically, 
the 
revised 
fiscal 
plan 
projections 
contemplate 
a 
net 
 inflow of over 20,000 people annually through 2029, compared to 
an average of less than 5,000 people in the 2023 fiscal plan. 
 The 2024 Fiscal Plan 
projects that approximately 
 54.5 billion in total 
disaster relief funding, from 
federal and private sources, 
will 
 be 
disbursed 
as part 
of 
the 
reconstruction 
efforts 
over 
a 
span of 
9 
years 
(fiscal 
years 
2024 
through 
2035). 
These 
funds 
will 
benefit 
 individuals, the 
public (e.g., 
reconstruction of 
major infrastructure, 
roads, and 
schools), and 
will cover 
part of 
Puerto Rico s 
share of 
 the 
cost 
of 
disaster 
relief 
funding. 
Also, 
the 
2024 
Fiscal 
Plan 
projects 
the 
 5.9 
billion 
in 
remaining 
COVID-19 
relief 
funds 
to 
be 
 deployed 
in fiscal 
years 2024 
and 
2025. 
Additionally, 
the 2024 
Fiscal Plan 
continues 
to account 
for 2.1 
billion 
in federal 
funds 
to 
 Puerto 
Rico 
from 
the 
Bipartisan 
Infrastructure 
Law 
directed 
towards 
improving 
Puerto 
Rico s 
infrastructure 
over 
fiscal 
years 
2024 
 through 
2026. 
Overall, 
Puerto 
Rico s 
economic 
growth 
is highly 
dependent 
on 
the 
Government s 
ability 
to 
efficiently 
deploy 
these 
 federal funds. 

127
 Debt Restructuring 

 Over 
80 
of 
Puerto 
Rico s 
outstanding 
debt 
has 
been 
restructured 
to 
date. 
On 
March 
15, 
2022, 
the 
Plan 
of 
Adjustment 
of 
the 
 central 
government s 
debt 
became 
effective 
through 
the 
exchange 
of more 
than 
 33 
billion 
of 
existing 
bonds 
and 
other 
claims 
into 
 approximately 
 7 
billion 
of 
new 
bonds, 
saving 
Puerto 
Rico 
more 
than 
 50 
billion 
in 
debt 
payments 
to 
creditors. 
Also, 
the 
 restructurings 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Sales 
Tax 
Financing 
Corporation COFINA ), 
the 
Highways 
and 
Transportation 
Authority 
 HTA ), 
and 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Aqueducts 
and 
Sewers 
Authority PRASA 
are 
expected 
to 
yield 
savings 
of 
approximately 
 17.5 
 billion, 
 3.0 
billion, 
and 
 400 
million, 
respectively, 
in 
future 
debt 
service 
payments. 
The 
main 
restructuring 
pending 
is 
that 
of 
the 
 Puerto Rico 
Electric Power 
Authority PREPA ). 
All PREPA 
plan confirmation 
and bond-related 
litigation is 
currently stayed 
until 
 November 
13, 
2024, 
pursuant 
to 
a 
Court 
order 
dated 
October 
7, 
2024, 
as 
the 
mediation 
team 
continues 
to 
participate 
in 
multiple 
 discussions with the PROMESA oversight 
board, certain mediation parties and 
additional parties who filed objections 
to conformation 
 of the PREPA 
plan of adjustment. 
 Other Developments
 Notable 
progress 
continues 
to 
be 
made 
as 
part 
of 
the 
ongoing 
efforts 
of 
prioritizing 
the 
restoration, 
improvement, 
and 
 modernization of 
Puerto Rico s 
infrastructure, 
particularly in 
the aftermath 
of Hurricane 
Maria in 
2017. During 
the 12-month 
period 
 ended August 31, 
2024, over 3.4 billion 
in disaster relief funds 
were disbursed through 
the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency 
 FEMA 
Public 
Assistance 
program 
and 
the 
HUD 
Community 
Development 
Block 
Grant CDBG 
program, 
an 
11 
increase 
 when 
compared 
to 
the 
same 
period 
in 
2023. 
These 
funds 
will 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
supporting 
Puerto 
Rico s 
economic 
 stability and are expected to have 
a positive impact on the Island s 
infrastructure. For example, approximately 
86 of the projects that 
 FEMA 
has 
obligated 
to 
address 
damage 
caused 
by 
Hurricane 
Maria 
have 
resources 
to 
reinforce 
their 
infrastructure, 
among 
other 
 hazard 
mitigation measures, 
that will 
prepare 
these facilities 
for 
future weather 
events. As 
of October 
10, 2024, 
over 3,411 
projects 
 had already been completed 
under FEMA s 
Public Assistance programs 
while over 20,600 projects 
were active across different 
stages 
 of execution 
for a 
total cost 
of 11.5 
billion, equivalent 
to approximately 
32 of 
the agency s 
 36.0 billion 
obligation, according 
to 
 the Central Office for Recovery, 
Reconstruction and Resiliency COR3 ). 
 After more 
than five 
years since 
the confirmation 
of the 
COFINA plan 
of adjustment, 
on October 
30, 2024, 
the Court 
granted the 
 PROMESA oversight 
board s 
request for 
entry of 
an order 
closing the 
COFINA Title 
III case, 
making it 
the first 
closed bankruptcy 
 case since the enactment of PROMESA. 

128
 Exposure to Puerto Rico Government 
 As of September 
30, 2024, the Corporation 
had 309.0 million 
of direct exposure 
to the Puerto Rico 
government, its municipalities 
 and 
public 
corporations, 
compared 
to 
 297.9 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023. 
The 
 11.1 
million 
increase 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
the 
 origination 
of 
two 
loans 
to 
municipalities, 
with 
an 
aggregate 
balance 
of 
 27.7 
million, 
that 
are 
supported 
by 
assigned 
property 
tax 
 revenues 
and 
 15.5 
million 
in 
disbursements 
on 
two 
construction 
loans 
to 
an 
agency 
and 
a 
public 
corporation, 
partially 
offset 
by 
 multiple repayments. 
As of 
September 30, 
2024, approximately 
 195.6 million 
of the 
exposure consisted 
of loans 
and obligations 
of 
 municipalities in Puerto 
Rico that are 
supported by assigned 
property tax revenues 
and for which, 
in most cases, the 
good faith, credit 
 and unlimited taxing 
power of the applicable 
municipality have been 
pledged to their 
repayment, and 50.9 
million consisted of loans 
 and obligations which 
are supported by 
one or more specific 
sources of municipal 
revenues. Approximately 72 
of the Corporation s 
 exposure to 
Puerto Rico 
municipalities consisted 
primarily of 
senior priority 
loans and 
obligations concentrated 
in four 
of the 
largest 
 municipalities in Puerto Rico. The municipalities are required 
by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts 
as are required for 
 the payment 
of all 
of their 
respective general 
obligation bonds 
and notes. 
In addition 
to municipalities, 
the total 
direct exposure 
also 
 included 
 8.8 
million 
in 
a 
loan 
extended 
to 
an 
affiliate 
of 
PREPA, 
 50.7 
million 
in 
loans 
to 
agencies 
or 
public 
corporations 
of 
the 
 Puerto 
Rico government 
, 
and obligations 
of the 
Puerto 
Rico 
government, 
specifically 
a residential 
pass-through 
MBS issued 
by the 
 PRHFA, 
at an 
amortized cost 
of 3.0 
million as 
part of 
its available-for-sale 
debt securities 
portfolio (fair 
value of 
 1.6 million 
as of 
 September 30, 2024).

 In 
addition, 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 73.5 
million 
in 
exposure 
to 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
are 
 guaranteed by 
the PRHFA, 
a governmental 
instrumentality that has 
been designated as 
a covered entity 
under PROMESA (December 
 31, 
2023 
 
 77.7 
million). 
Residential 
mortgage 
loans 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
PRHFA 
are 
secured 
by 
the 
underlying 
properties 
and 
the 
 guarantees serve 
to cover shortfalls 
in collateral in 
the event of 
a borrower default. 
The Puerto Rico 
government guarantees 
up to 75 
 million 
of 
the 
principal 
for 
all 
loans 
under 
the 
mortgage 
loan 
insurance 
program. 
According 
to 
the 
most 
recently 
released 
audited 
 financial 
statements 
of 
the 
PRHFA, 
as 
of 
June 
30, 
2023, 
the 
PRHFA s 
mortgage 
loans 
insurance 
program 
covered 
loans 
in 
an 
 aggregate 
amount 
of 
approximately 
 388 
million. 
The 
regulations 
adopted 
by 
the 
PRHFA 
require 
the 
establishment 
of 
adequate 
 reserves to 
guarantee 
the solvency 
of the 
mortgage loans 
insurance 
program. As 
of June 
30, 2023, 
the most 
recent date 
as of 
which 
 information is available, the PRHFA 
had a liability of approximately 1.3 million as an estimate of the 
losses inherent in the portfolio. 
 As 
of 
each 
of 
September 
30, 
2024 
and 
December 
31, 
2023, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 2.7 
billion 
of 
public 
sector 
deposits 
in 
Puerto 
 Rico. Approximately 
22 of the 
public sector deposits 
as of September 
30, 2024 were 
from municipalities and 
municipal agencies 
in 
 Puerto Rico 
and 78 
were from 
public corporations, 
the Puerto 
Rico central 
government and 
agencies, and 
U.S. federal 
government 
 agencies in Puerto Rico. 

129
 Exposure to USVI Government 
 The Corporation has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure 
to USVI government entities. 
 For many years, the 
USVI has been experiencing 
several fiscal and economic 
challenges that have deteriorated 
the overall financial 
 and 
economic 
conditions 
in 
the 
area. 
On 
June 
17, 
2024, 
the 
United 
States 
Bureau 
of 
Economic 
Analysis 
(the 
 BEA 
released 
its 
 estimates of GDP 
for 2022. 
According to 
the BEA, the 
USVI s 
real GDP decreased 
1.3 in 2022 
after increasing 
3.7 in 2021. 
The 
 decrease 
in 
real 
GDP 
reflected 
declines 
in 
exports, 
private 
fixed 
investment, 
government 
spending, 
and 
personal 
consumption 
 expenditures. These 
negative variances were 
partly offset 
by an increase 
in inventory investment, 
while imports, 
a subtraction item 
in 
 the calculation of GDP, 
decreased. 
 Over the past 
three years, the 
USVI has been 
recovering from the 
adverse impact caused 
by COVID-19 and 
has continued to 
make 
 progress 
on 
its 
rebuilding 
efforts 
related 
to 
Hurricanes 
Irma 
and 
Maria, 
which 
occurred 
in 
September 
2017. 
According 
to 
data 
 published by FEMA, over 
 5.5 billion in disaster recovery 
funds had been disbursed through 
August 2024 and nearly 11 
billion were 
 remaining 
obligated 
funds 
pending 
to 
be disbursed. 
Moreover, 
labor 
market 
trends 
remain 
stable 
with 
non-farm 
payrolls during 
the 
 third quarter of 2024 slightly down by 0.4 and 0.8 on a quarter 
-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, respectively. 
 On December 14, 2023, 
Fitch Ratings announced that it 
withdrew the ratings of the 
U.S. Virgin 
Islands Water 
and Power Authority 
 WAPA 
primarily 
due 
to 
limited 
availability 
of 
the 
authority s 
operating 
and 
financial 
information 
from 
public 
sources 
or 
from 
 WAPA s 
management. 
 Finally, PROMESA 
does not apply to 
the USVI and, as such, 
there is currently no federal 
legislation permitting the restructuring 
of 
 the debts of the USVI and 
its public corporations and instrumentalities. 
To the 
extent that the fiscal condition of the 
USVI government 
 deteriorates 
again, 
the 
U.S. 
Congress 
or 
the 
government 
of 
the 
USVI 
may 
enact 
legislation 
allowing 
for 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
 financial 
obligations 
of 
the 
USVI 
government 
entities 
or 
imposing 
a 
stay 
on 
creditor 
remedies, 
including 
by 
making 
PROMESA 
 applicable to the USVI. 
 As of 
September 30, 
2024 and 
December 31, 
2023, the 
Corporation had 
 48.4 million 
and 90.5 
million, respectively, 
in loans 
to 
 USVI public 
corporations, of 
which 15.0 
million and 
 57.2 million, 
respectively, 
were fully 
collateralized by 
cash balances 
held at 
 the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, all loans were currently performing 
and up to date on principal and interest payments.

and reported 
to the 
Corporation s 
management, 
including 
the Chief 
Executive 
 Office and Chief Financial Officer, 
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were 
no changes 
to the 
Corporation s 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting (as 
defined 
in Rules 
13a-15(f) and 
15d-15(f) 
 under 
the Exchange 
Act) during 
our most 
recent 
quarter 
ended September 
30, 2024 
that have 
materially 
affected, 
or are 
reasonably 
 likely to materially affect, the Corporation s 
internal control over financial reporting.

 The Corporation s business, operating results and/or the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a number of 
 factors. A detailed 
discussion of certain 
risk factors that 
could affect 
the Corporation s future 
operations, financial 
condition or results 
for 
 future periods is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors, and others, could 
 cause actual 
results to 
differ materially 
from historical 
results or 
the results 
contemplated by 
the forward-looking statements 
contained in 
 this report. Also, 
refer to the 
discussion in 
 Forward-Looking Statements and 
Part I, Item 
2, Management s 
Discussion and 
Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations, in this Quarterly 
Report on Form 10-Q for 
additional information that may supplement 
or 
 update the discussion of risk factors in the 
2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Other than as described below, there have been 
no material changes from those risk factors previously 
disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk 
 Factors, in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 
10-K. 
 The 
volatility 
in 
the 
financial 
services 
industry, 
including 
failures 
or 
rumored 
failures 
of 
other 
depository 
institutions, 
and 
 actions taken by governmental 
agencies to stabilize the financial 
system, could result in, 
among other things, bank deposit 
runoffs, 
 liquidity constraints, 
and increased regulatory requirements and costs. 
 The closure and 
placement into receivership 
with the FDIC 
of certain large 
U.S. regional banks with 
assets over 100 billion 
in March 
 and 
May 
2023, 
and 
adverse 
developments 
affecting 
other 
banks, 
resulted 
in 
heightened 
levels 
of 
market 
volatility 
and 
consequently 
 negatively 
impacted 
customer 
confidence 
in 
the 
safety 
and 
soundness 
of 
financial 
institutions. 
These 
developments 
resulted 
in 
certain 
 regional banks experiencing higher than normal 
deposit outflows and an elevated 
level of competition for available 
deposits in the market. 
 The impact of market 
volatility from the adverse 
developments in the banking industry, 
along with continued elevated interest 
rates on our 
 business and related financial results, will 
depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain 
and difficult to predict. 

 In the 
aftermath of 
these recent 
bank failures, 
the banking 
agencies have 
increased regulatory 
requirements and 
costs that 
may impact 
 capital ratios or the FDIC deposit insurance premium. For example, 
in 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule to impose a 
special assessment to 
 recover 
certain estimated 
losses 
to 
the 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Fund DIF arising 
from 
the 
closures of 
Silicon Valley 
Bank 
and 
Signature 
 Bank. The 
estimated losses 
will be recovered 
through quarterly special 
assessments collected 
from certain 
insured depository 
institutions, 
 including the 
Bank, and 
collection began 
during the 
quarter ended 
June 30, 
2024. In 
connection with 
updates made 
by the 
FDIC to 
the 
 initial estimated 
losses to 
the DIF, 
the Corporation 
recorded charges 
of 1.1 
million during 
the nine-month 
period ended 
September 30, 
 2024 in 
the consolidated 
statements of 
income as 
part of 
 FDIC deposit 
insurance expenses. 
As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
estimated 
 FDIC special assessment amounted to 7.4 million, 
of which 1.6 million has been paid. 
The Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC s 
 estimated loss to the DIF, which could affect the 
amount of its accrued liability.

 As of September 30, 2024, 
the Corporation was authorized 
to purchase up to 225 million 
of the Corporation s 
common stock under the 
program that was publicly announced 
on July 24, 
 2023, of 
which 175 
million had 
been utilized. 
In addition, 
the Corporation 
was authorized 
to purchase 
up to 
 250 million 
that could 
include repurchases 
of common 
stock or 
junior 
 subordinated

During 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
redeemed 
 50.0 
million 
of 
junior 
 subordinated debentures 
under the 
 250 million 
repurchase program, 
as further 
explained in 
Note 7

The 
 remaining 250.0 
million in the

the remaining amount 
authorized under 
both repurchase 
programs. The 
Corporation s 
repurchase programs 
do not obligate 
it to acquire 
 any specific number of 
shares and do not 
have an expiration date. 
The repurchase programs may 
be modified, suspended, 
or terminated at any 
time at the Corporation's 
discretion. Under 
 the stock 
repurchase program, 
shares may 
be repurchased 
through open 
market purchases, 
accelerated share 
repurchases and/or 
privately negotiated 
transactions, including 
under plans 
 complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. 
 (2) 
 Consists of 898 shares 
of common stock acquired 
by the Corporation to 
cover minimum tax 
withholding obligations upon 
the vesting of equity-based 
awards. The Corporation 
intends to 
 continue to satisfy statutory tax withholding obligations in connection 
with the vesting of outstanding restricted stock and 
performance units through the withholding of shares.
