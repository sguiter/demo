The 2026 Notes are the Company s senior, unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Company s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 2026 Notes and effectively subordinated to the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The Note Guarantee (as defined in the Indenture) of each future guarantor, if any, will be such guarantor s senior, unsecured obligations and is equal in right of payment with existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to such future guarantor s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 2026 Notes and effectively subordinated to such future guarantor s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. 
 
 The Indenture contains covenants that limit the Company s ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock; and (ii) create or incur liens. 
 
 The 2026 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture), at the Company s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after December 15, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price on 1 each of at least trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and 2 the trading day immediately before the date it sends such notice. 
 
 In addition, the 2026 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company s option at any time, and from time to time, on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of a holder of 2026 Notes as of the close of business on a record date to receive the related interest payment on the corresponding interest payment date), if the Company completes the "Specified Divestiture" of x one or more of its manufacturing facilities located in the People s Republic of China and/or (y) significant assets located in the People s Republic of China which relate to the Company s transceiver business and multi-channel optical sub-assembly products (or any substantially related assets), for aggregate consideration in cash to the Company of not less than the U.S. Dollar equivalent of (measured at the time of completion). 
 
 Calling any Convertible Note for redemption will constitute a Make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to that Convertible Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Convertible Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. 
 
 In addition, if the Specified Divestiture is completed, then each holder of 2026 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase its 2026 Notes for cash on a date of the Company s choosing, which must be a business day that is no more than 35, nor less than 20, business days after we send the related notice of Specified Divestiture. The repurchase price for a note tendered for such repurchase will be equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date (subject to the right of a holder of 2026 Notes as of the close of business on a record date to receive the related interest payment on the corresponding interest payment date). 
 
 Moreover, if the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as described in the Indenture, holders of the 2026 Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their 2026 Notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the required repurchase date. 
 
 Additionally, the 2026 Notes are subject to customary events of default. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes. 
 
 Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 815 - 40, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, the Company evaluated whether the conversion feature of the note needed to be bifurcated from the host instrument as a freestanding financial instrument. Under ASC 815 - 40, to qualify for equity classification (or non-bifurcation, if embedded) the instrument (or embedded feature) must be both 1 indexed to the issuer s own stock and 2 meet the requirements of the equity classification guidance. Based upon the Company s analysis, it was determined the conversion option is indexed to its own stock and also met all the criteria for equity classification contained in ASC 815 - 40 - 25 - 7 and 815 - 40 - 25 - 10. Accordingly, the conversion option is not required to be bifurcated from the host instrument as a freestanding financial instrument. Since the conversion feature meets the equity scope exception from derivative accounting, the Company then evaluated whether the conversion feature needed to be separately accounted for as an equity component under ASC 470 - 20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company determined that notes should be accounted for in their entirety as a liability. 

The Company incurred approximately million in transaction costs in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes. These costs were recognized as a reduction of the carrying amount of the Notes utilizing the effective interest method and are being amortized over the term of the Notes.

 Performance Based Incentive 
 
 Starting in 2021, certain senior executives were granted performance stock units ("PSUs") under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan "2021 Plan"), which generally vest over a three -year period subject to achievement of certain pre-established performance metrics. The number of shares of common stock that would ultimately be issued to settle PSUs granted ranged from to of the target number of shares granted. We estimate the fair value of the PSUs on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model, with stock-based compensation expense recognized ratably over the applicable three -year performance period . The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for the PSUs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of million and million, respectively. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of million and million, respectively. 
 
 On June 12, 2024, the Compensation Committee certified the Company exceeded the maximum performance target level for each of the performance targets set for the PSUs granted in June 2021 the "2021 PSUs"). Therefore, applicable employees were entitled to payment of the 2021 PSUs at of the target shares granted under the 2021 Plan. On June 6, 2024, at the annual meeting of stockholders, a proposal to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan by shares was not approved, and as a result, the Company did not have enough shares of common stock available for issuance to satisfy the additional shares earned above of target shares of the 2021 PSUs (the "2021 Additional Shares"). In lieu of shares of common stock, the Company settled the 2021 Additional Shares in cash, resulting in an additional million of stock-based compensation expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

primarily due to the change of the valuation allowance on federal, state, Taiwan, and China deferred tax assets ("DTA"). 
 
 The Company continually monitors and performs an assessment of the realizability of its DTAs, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets using a more likely than not standard. In making such assessment, more weight was given to evidence that could be objectively verified, including recent cumulative losses. Based on the Company s review of this evidence, management determined that a full valuation allowance against all of the Company s net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 was appropriate.

The Comptroller s office exhausted its redetermination period and therefore moved AOI s case to the hearing process. No hearing date has yet been scheduled, and as a result the Company is not able to determine the outcome of this sales tax dispute or the likelihood or amount of the Company s loss, if any, arising from this matter.

 Overview 
 
 We are a leading, vertically integrated provider of fiber-optic networking products. We target four networking end-markets: internet data centers, cable television, ("CATV"), telecommunications ("telecom"), and fiber-to-the-home ("FTTH"). We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. In designing products for our customers, we typically begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers needs and specifications, and such products differ from each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We are primarily focused on the higher-performance segments within the internet data center, CATV, telecom and FTTH markets which increasingly demand faster connectivity and innovation. 
 
 The four end markets we target are all driven by significant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected devices, video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. Within the internet data center market, we benefit from the increasing use of higher-capacity optical networking technology as a replacement for older, lower-speed optical interconnects, particularly as speeds reach 800 Gbps and above, as well as the movement to open internet data center architectures and the increasing use of in-house equipment design among leading internet companies. Within the CATV market, we benefit from a number of ongoing trends including the move to higher bandwidth networks among CATV service providers, especially the desire by MSOs to increase the return-path bandwidth available to offer to their customers. In the FTTH market, we benefit from continuing PON deployments and system updates among telecom service providers. In the telecom market, we benefit from deployment of new high-speed fiber-optic networks by telecom network operators, including 5G networks. 
 
 Our vertically integrated manufacturing model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development, fast response times to customer requests and greater control over product quality and manufacturing costs. We design, manufacture and integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary Molecular Beam Epitaxy, or MBE, and Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) alternative processes for the fabrication of lasers. We believe the use of both processes, and our knowledge of how to combine these processes with others to fabricate lasers is unique in our industry. We manufacture the majority of the laser chips and optical components that are used in our products. The lasers we manufacture are tested extensively to enable reliable operation over time and our devices are often highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity, making them well-suited to the CATV, FTTH and 5G telecom markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors. All of our laser chips are manufactured in our facility in Sugar Land, Texas. We believe that our domestic production capacity for these devices gives us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors, as we believe that many of our customers prefer to source key components from suppliers who have domestic manufacturing capacity. 
 
 We have three manufacturing sites: Sugar Land, Texas, Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan. Our research and development functions are generally partnered with our manufacturing locations, and we have an additional research and development facility in Duluth, Georgia. In our Sugar Land facility, we manufacture laser chips (utilizing our MBE and MOCVD processes), subassemblies and components. The subassemblies are used in the manufacture of components by our other manufacturing facilities or sold to third parties as modules. We manufacture our laser chips only within our Sugar Land facility, where our laser design team is located. In our Taiwan location, we manufacture optical components, such as our butterfly lasers, which incorporate laser chips, subassemblies and components manufactured within our Sugar Land facility. Additionally, in our Taiwan location, we manufacture transceivers for the internet data center, telecom, FTTH and other markets. In our China facility, we take advantage of lower labor costs and manufacture certain more labor intensive components and optical equipment systems, such as optical subassemblies and transceivers for the CATV transmitters (at the headend), CATV outdoor equipment (at the node) and internet data center market. Each manufacturing facility conducts testing on the components, modules or subsystems it manufactures and each facility is certified to ISO 9001:2015. Our facilities in Ningbo, China, Taipei, Taiwan, and Sugar Land, Texas are all certified to ISO 14001:2015. 
 
 Our business depends on winning competitive bid selection processes to develop components, systems and equipment for use in our customers products. These selection processes are typically lengthy, and as a result our sales cycles will vary based on the level of customization required, market served, whether the design win is with an existing or new customer and whether our solution being designed in our customers product is our first generation or subsequent generation product. We do not have any long-term purchase commitments (in excess of one year) with any of our customers, most of whom purchase our products on a purchase order basis. However, once one of our solutions is incorporated into a customer s design, we believe that our solution is likely to continue to be purchased for that design throughout that product s life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative solution. 
 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 13139 Jess Pirtle Blvd., Sugar Land, TX 77478, and our telephone number is (281) 295-1800.

Termination of the Divestiture Agreement with Yuhan Optoelectronic Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd 
 
 On September 15, 2022, the Company and Prime World International Holdings Ltd. (the "Seller") entered into the Purchase Agreement with Yuhan Optoelectronic Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (the "Purchaser") for the sale of the manufacturing facilities in the People's Republic of China and certain assets related to its transceiver business and multi-channel optical sub-assembly products. On September 12, 2023, we delivered a notice of termination to the Purchaser to terminate the Purchase Agreement as a result of the Purchaser's failure to satisfy certain of its material obligations under the Purchase Agreement. In doing so, we also asserted the right to recover a break-up fee from the Purchaser. On December 22, 2023, the Purchaser filed for arbitration in Hong Kong with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre disputing the validity of our termination notice and seeking specific performance with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, which would in any case remain subject to regulatory approvals. We filed our response on January 22, 2024, generally denying the Purchaser s allegations and asserting certain counterclaims. The HKIAC Tribunal issued a procedural order on April 17, 2024 setting the evidentiary hearing to be held on September 2025. We are not able to determine the outcome of this dispute or the likelihood or amount of our loss or recovery, if any, arising from this matter.

The changes in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily due to increased demand from CATV customers, offset by the lack of non-recurring engineering ("NRE") revenue in the third quarter of 2024 and the effect of pricing reductions offered to certain of our data center customers in 2024, which affected our data center market. The changes in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily due to increased demand from major data center customers, offset by weak demand from CATV and telecom customers. CATV demand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than in the corresponding period in the prior year largely due to a pending technology transition from older-generation products compliant with the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification ("DOCSIS") version 3.1, to the newer DOCSIS 4.0 standard. Due to the pending transition from the older to newer standard, customers are placing fewer orders for the older products and instead reducing their inventory of such products. 
 
 We have begun to see increased orders for our 400G data center products from several large customers. Based on forecasts from our customers, we expect increased demand for these products through the end of 2024. We entered into a supply agreement with Microsoft to design certain data center goods and to build a supply chain to manufacture, assemble, sell and ship the goods to them or an authorized purchasing entity. The initial term of the agreement is five years with automatic renewal unless terminated earlier. 
 
 In addition to our existing data center customers, we have also begun to receive orders from a hyperscale data center customer from which we have not received significant orders in several years. While the new customer interaction is not material within the quarter, we believe that both this new customer interaction and much of the growth in our existing data center business is related to efforts by these customers to increase processing capacity within their data centers, largely to accommodate applications enabled by generative artificial intelligence ("AI"). 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , our top ten customers represented 95.8 and 96.1 of our revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , our top ten customers represented 93.7 and 93.3 of our revenue, respectively. We believe that diversifying our customer base is critical for our future success, since reliance on a small number of key customers makes our ability to forecast future results dependent upon the accuracy of the forecasts we receive from those key customers. We continue to prioritize new customer acquisition and growth of diverse revenue streams.

Cost of goods sold increased by 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in cost of goods sold was due to increased revenue and higher cost of certain materials, partially offset by lower inventory reserve in the current period. Cost of goods sold decreased by 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower sales, lower inventory write-off expenses and lower inventory reserve expenses in 2024 . 
 
 Gross profit decreased by 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 .

Research and development expense 
 
 Research and development expense increased by 4.0 million, or 42.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Research and development expense increased by 11.6 million, or 43.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023 . The increases were primarily due to increased personnel-related expense, increased R D related project costs and increased R D consulting fees for ongoing R D projects. The increases in R D expenses were driven by customer demands for new products as well as acceleration of previously-planned project expenditures which were necessary to accommodate accelerated demand projections for these products from certain customers.

 Sales and marketing expense increased by 1.8 million, or 58.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expense increased by 6.9 million, or 90.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily due to the increased business development effort in our CATV and data center businesses, higher shipping costs and increases in trade show expenses. 
 
 General and administrative expense 
 
 General and administrative expense was approximately the same for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . General and administrative expense increased by 4.9 million, or 12.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023 .

Interest income increased by 0.09 million, or 140 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased by 0.38 million or 282.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. The increases were due to higher saving balances and higher interest rate on our saving account in the first three quarters of 2024 . 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 0.3 million, or 14.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense decreased by 1.2 million, or 19.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. The decreases were due to the termination of the loan with CIT Northbridge in November 2023. 
 
 Other income (expenses) increased by 0.7 million, or 198 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Other income (expenses) increased by 1.2 million, or 143.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023 .These increases were mainly due to the resolution of legal matters , increased government subsidy income and positive foreign exchange impact. 
 
 Benefit (provision) for income taxes 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0 . T he effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the change of the valuation allowance on federal, state, Taiwan, and China deferred tax assets ("DTA"). 
 
 On August 9, 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act ("CHIPS Act") was enacted. Among its provisions, the bill provides various federal grants, tax credits, and incentives for investment in the United States. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") was also signed into law. Among other provisions, the IRA imposes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax ("Corporate AMT") for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, imposes a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and provides tax incentives to promote various energy efficient initiatives. To the extent that we make investments in expanding manufacturing in our semiconductor fabrication facility in Texas, we believe that the CHIPS Act would provide a refundable tax credit for certain equipment and facilities upgrades. We made significant such investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, but we intend to continue to evaluate future investments for applicability to the tax credit provisions of the CHIPS Act.

Comprehensive loss increased by 5.8 million, or 60.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Comprehensive loss increased by 20.7 million, or 44.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023 .The changes were primarily due to increase of net loss of 8.8 million and 24.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and offset by foreign currency translation adjustments for non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations of 3.0 million and 4.1 million, respectively.

 On March 13, 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "Agreement") with Raymond James Associates (the "Sales Agent") pursuant to which the Company could issue and sell shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share (the "Shares") having an aggregate offering price of up to 25 million (the "ATM Offering"), from time to time through the Sales Agent. Upon delivery of a placement notice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, sales of the Shares were made through the Sales Agent in transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), including sales made through the facilities of the Nasdaq Global Market, the principal trading market for the Company s common stock, on any other existing trading market for the Company s common stock, to or through a market maker or as otherwise agreed by the Company and the Sales Agent. In the placement notice, the Company would designate the maximum number of Shares to be sold through the Sales Agent, the time period during which sales were requested to be made, the minimum price for the Shares to be sold, and any limitation on the number of Shares that could be sold in any one day. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Sales Agent would use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell Shares on the Company s behalf up to the designated amount specified in the placement notice. 
 
 The Agreement provided that the Sales Agent would be entitled to compensation of up to 2 of the gross sales price of the Shares sold through the Sales Agent from time to time. The Company also agreed to reimburse the Sales Agent for certain specified expenses in connection with the registration of Shares under state blue sky laws and any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc., not to exceed 10,000 in the aggregate, and any associated application fees incurred.

China factory construction 
 
 On February 8, 2018, we entered into a construction contract with Zhejiang Xinyu Construction Group Co., Ltd. for the construction of a new factory and other facilities at our Ningbo, China location. Construction costs for these facilities under this contract are estimated to total approximately 27.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, construction of the building shell is complete, and approximately 27.4 million of this total cost has been paid and the remaining portion will be paid in yearly installments for three years after final inspection. We anticipate additional expenses for building improvements to the factory and we are in the process of evaluating the timing of these expenditures and obtaining bids for any such work. Based on forecasts, we believe the factory will be placed in service in the year 2024 after the construction is completed for the building interior work. Property will be transferred from construction in progress to building and improvement at that time. 
 
 Future liquidity needs 
 
 We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 41.4 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 13.7 million compared to December 31, 2023. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the building improvement of a new factory and other facilities at our Ningbo, China location, changes in our manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a total loan balance (excluding convertible notes) of 29.5 million from various lenders in China and had 23.3 million available borrowing capacity on existing credit lines. Should additional liquidity be needed, our Board may authorize issuance of additional common stock under an at-the-market offering in the future (see the discussion of "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 2). 
 
 In the event we need additional liquidity, we will explore additional sources of liquidity. These additional sources of liquidity could include one, or a combination, of the following: (i) issuing equity or debt securities, (ii) incurring indebtedness secured by our assets and (iii) selling product lines, other assets and/or portions of our business. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 Please refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a complete discussion of its contractual obligations and commitments. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 The annual inflation rate in the US reduced to 3.4 in 2023. Even though inflation has slowed from the peak, it remained well above the Federal Reserve's objective of 2 . The annual inflation rate in Taiwan came down to 2.7 in 2023 from 2.95 in 2022. The cost of inflation was reflected in increases in shipping costs, labor rates, and in costs of some raw materials. We believe these decreases are related to the supply chain pressure easing and decreasing commodity prices, however the labor market is still tight, and the wage pressure is still high. We cannot be sure when or if prices will return to pre-pandemic levels. Compared to other major economies in the world, China has a stable level of inflation, which has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results. We do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024. However, there is no guarantee that we may increase selling prices or reduce costs to fully mitigate the effect of inflation on our costs, which may adversely impact our sales margins and profitability. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 In our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in the Notes to the Financial Statements herein, we identify our most critical accounting policies. In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, inventory reserves, impairment of long-lived assets, service and product warranties, share based compensation expense, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material.
