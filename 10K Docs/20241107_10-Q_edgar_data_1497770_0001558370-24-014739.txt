 million Fannie Mae loan, which consisted of a million advance previously made to Fannie Mae in 2023 and a million cash payment during the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an immaterial allowance for credit loss related to this loan, as the Company expects to liquidate the underlying collateral for an amount slightly less than the Company s cost basis in the loan. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company received repurchase demand letters from Fannie Mae for additional loans with a total unpaid principal balance UPB of million. The Company previously recorded collateral-based reserves for these loans prior to receiving the repurchase demand letters that as of September 30, 2024, totaled million. Freddie Mac The Company received repurchase requests from Freddie Mac related to loans with UPBs of million First loan and million Second loan ). In March 2024, the Company entered into a forbearance and indemnification agreement with Freddie Mac that among other things delayed the repurchase of these loans for six and for the First and Second loans, respectively, and transferred the risk of loss for both loans from Freddie Mac to the Company. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company received a extension related to the First loan. The fair value of the indemnification related to the First loan is de minimis due to the excess of fair value of the underlying collateral compared to the carrying value of the loan. With respect to the Second loan, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s best estimate of the fair value of the indemnification was million, which is included within Other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding amount included in Provision (benefit) for credit losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. and are all adjustable-rate, interest-only, multifamily loans with similar risk characteristics and no geographic concentration. The Company also has an immaterial amount of LHFI associated with the repurchased loan as discussed above. The loans are carried at their unpaid principal balances, adjusted for net unamortized loan fees and costs, and net of any allowance for loan losses. LHFI are included as a component of Other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of the Interim Loan Program portfolio consisted of a small number of loans with a balance of million and million, respectively, including an immaterial amount of net unamortized deferred fees and costs and allowance for loan losses. There were ILP loans delinquent and in non-accrual status as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amortized cost basis of loans that were current was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 billion as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company uses a discounted static cash flow valuation approach, and the key economic assumption is the discount rate. For example, see the following sensitivities related to the discount rate: The impact of a - basis point increase in the discount rate as of September 30, 2024 would be a decrease in the fair value of million to the MSRs outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The impact of a - basis point increase in the discount rate as of September 30, 2024 would be a decrease in the fair value of million to the MSRs outstanding as of September 30, 2024. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. These estimates do not include interplay among assumptions and are estimated as a portfolio rather than individual assets.

The key inputs for the CECL allowance are the historic loss rate, the forecast-period loss rate, the reversion-period loss rate, and the UPB of the at-risk servicing portfolio. A summary of the key inputs of the CECL allowance as of the end of each of the quarters presented and the provision (benefit) impact during each quarter for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 follows.

The look-back period updates resulted in the historical loss rate factors decreasing and the benefit for CECL allowance, as noted in the table above. The Company also slightly increased its forecast-period and reversion-period loss rates during the three months ended March 31, 2023 to incorporate uncertain macroeconomic conditions. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the ratio of the forecast-period loss rate to the historical loss rate increased, resulting in a much lower benefit for CECL allowance. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company updated its forecast-period loss rate from basis points to basis points, leading to the benefit for CECL allowance shown above. During the third quarter of 2023, the provision for CECL allowance shown above was primarily the result of an increased at-risk UPB. The weighted average remaining life of the at-risk Fannie Mae servicing portfolio as of September 30, 2024 was years compared to years as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had loans with aggregate collateral-based reserves of million compared to loans with aggregate collateral-based reserves of million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the maximum quantifiable contingent liability associated with the Company s guaranties for the at-risk loans serviced under the Fannie Mae DUS agreement was billion and billion, respectively. This maximum quantifiable contingent liability relates to the at-risk loans serviced for Fannie Mae at the specific point in time indicated. The maximum quantifiable contingent liability is not representative of the actual loss the Company would incur. The Company would be liable for this amount only if all of the loans it services for Fannie Mae, for which the Company retains some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans were determined to be without value at the time of settlement. billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to billion as of December 31, 2023.

Pledged securities held in the form of money market funds holding U.S. Treasuries are discounted , and Agency mortgage-backed securities Agency MBS are discounted for purposes of calculating compliance with the restricted liquidity requirements. As seen below, the Company held the majority of its pledged securities in Agency MBS as of September 30, 2024. The majority of the loans for which the Company has risk sharing are Tier 2 loans. The Company is in compliance with the September 30, 2024 collateral requirements as outlined above. As of September 30, 2024, reserve requirements for the DUS loan portfolio will require the Company to fund million in additional restricted liquidity over the next , assuming no further principal paydowns, prepayments, or defaults within the at-risk portfolio. Fannie Mae has reassessed the DUS Capital Standards in the past and may make changes to these standards in the future. The Company generates sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet these capital standards and does not expect any future changes to have a material impact on its future operations; however, any future increases to collateral requirements may adversely impact the Company s available cash. Fannie Mae has established benchmark standards for capital adequacy and reserves the right to terminate the Company's servicing authority for all or some of the portfolio if, at any time, it determines that the Company's financial condition is not adequate to support its obligations under the DUS agreement. The Company is required to maintain acceptable net worth, as defined in the agreement, and the Company satisfied the requirements as of September 30, 2024. The net worth requirement is derived primarily from unpaid principal balances on Fannie Mae loans and the level of risk sharing. As of September 30, 2024, the net worth requirement was million, and the Company's net worth, as defined in the requirements, was million, as measured at the Company s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Walker Dunlop, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was required to maintain at least million of liquid assets to meet operational liquidity requirements for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, and Ginnie Mae, and the Company had operational liquidity, as defined in the requirements, of million as of September 30, 2024, as measured at the Company s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Walker Dunlop, LLC.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, thousand average restricted shares and thousand average restricted shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS under the treasury-stock method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, thousand average restricted shares and thousand average restricted shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation. These average restricted shares were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS under the treasury method because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (the exercise price of the options, or the grant date market price of the restricted shares was greater than the average market price of the Company s shares of common stock during the periods presented). In February 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that permits the repurchase of up to million of the Company s common stock over a period beginning on February 23, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company did t repurchase any shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had million of authorized share repurchase capacity remaining under the 2024 share repurchase program. During each of the first three quarters of 2024, the Company paid a dividend of per share. On , the Company s Board of Directors declared a dividend of per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. The dividend will be paid on to all holders of record of the Company s restricted and unrestricted common stock as of . The Company awarded million and million of stock to settle compensation liabilities, a non-cash transaction, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s note payable contains direct restrictions on the amount of dividends the Company may pay, and the warehouse debt facilities and agreements with the Agencies contain minimum equity, liquidity, and other capital requirements that indirectly restrict the amount of dividends the Company may pay. The Company does not believe that these restrictions currently limit the amount of dividends the Company can pay for the foreseeable future. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased a noncontrolling interest for cash consideration of million, of which million was paid at the time of closing, with an additional million to be paid in each of the next quarters. The purchase of the noncontrolling interest resulted in a reduction to APIC of million (a non-cash transaction) for the excess of the purchase price over the noncontrolling interest balance.

The purchase of the noncontrolling interest is expected to result in an increase to APIC of million (a non-cash transaction) for the excess of the noncontrolling interest balance over the purchase price. reportable segments. The reportable segments are determined based on the product or service provided and reflect the manner in which management is currently evaluating the Company s financial information. (i) Capital Markets CM CM provides a comprehensive range of commercial real estate finance products to its customers, including Agency lending, debt brokerage, property sales, and appraisal and valuation services. The Company s long-established relationships with the Agencies and institutional investors enable CM to offer a broad range of loan products and services to the Company s customers, including first mortgage, second trust, supplemental, construction, mezzanine, preferred equity, and small-balance loans. CM provides property sales services to owners and developers of multifamily properties and commercial real estate and multifamily property appraisals for various investors. CM also provides real estate-related investment banking and advisory services, including housing market research. 
 As part of Agency lending, CM temporarily funds the loans it originates (loans held for sale) before selling them to the Agencies and earns net interest income on the spread between the interest income on the loans and the warehouse interest expense. For Agency loans, CM recognizes the fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, which represents the right to receive future servicing fees. CM also earns fees for origination of loans for both Agency lending and debt brokerage, fees for property sales, appraisals, and investment banking and advisory services, and subscription revenue for its housing market research. Direct internal, including compensation, and external costs that are specific to CM are included within the results of this reportable segment. (ii) Servicing Asset Management SAM SAM s activities include: (i) servicing and asset-managing the portfolio of loans the Company (a) originates and sells to the Agencies, (b) brokers to certain life insurance companies, and (c) originates through its principal lending and investing activities, (ii) managing third-party capital invested in commercial real estate assets through senior secured debt or limited partnership equity instruments, e.g., preferred equity, mezzanine debt, etc. either through funds or direct investments, and (iii) managing third-party capital invested in tax credit equity funds focused on the LIHTC sector and other commercial real estate. 
 SAM earns revenue mainly through fees for servicing and asset-managing the loans in the Company s servicing portfolio and asset management fees for managing third-party capital. Direct internal, including compensation, and external costs that are specific to SAM are included within the results of this reportable segment. (iii) Corporate The Corporate segment consists primarily of the Company s treasury operations and other corporate-level activities. The Company s treasury activities include monitoring and managing liquidity and funding requirements, including corporate debt. Other corporate-level activities include equity-method investments, accounting, information technology, legal, human resources, marketing, internal audit, and various other corporate groups support functions ). The Company does not allocate costs from these support functions to the CM or SAM segments in presenting segment operating results. The Company does allocate interest expense and income tax expense. Corporate debt and the related interest expense are allocated first based on specific acquisitions where debt was directly used to fund the acquisition, such as the acquisition of Alliant, and then based on the remaining segment assets. Income tax expense is allocated proportionally based on income from operations at each segment, except for significant, one-time tax activities, which are allocated entirely to the segment impacted by the tax activity.

We are one of the largest service providers to multifamily operators in the country. We originate, sell, and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products, including loans through the programs of the GSEs, and the Federal Housing Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (together with Ginnie Mae, HUD (collectively, the Agencies ). We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans that we originate for the Agencies programs. We broker, and occasionally service, loans to commercial real estate operators for many life insurance companies, commercial banks, and other institutional investors, in which cases we do not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker. We provide multifamily property sales brokerage and appraisal and valuation services and engage in commercial real estate investment management activities, including a focus on the affordable housing sector through low-income housing tax credit LIHTC syndication. We engage in the development and preservation of affordable housing projects through joint ventures with real estate developers and the management of funds focused on affordable housing. We provide housing market research and real estate-related investment banking and advisory services, which provide our clients and us with market insight into many areas of the housing market. Our clients are owners and developers of multifamily properties and other commercial real estate assets across the country. We also underwrite, service, and asset-manage shorter-term loans on transitional commercial real estate. Most of these shorter-term interim loans are closed through a joint venture or through separate accounts managed by our investment management subsidiary, Walker Dunlop Investment Partners, Inc. WDIP ). In the past, some of these interim loans were closed and retained by us through our Interim Loan Program (as defined below in Investment Management and Principal Lending and Investing ). We are a leader in commercial real estate technology, developing and acquiring technology resources that (i) provide innovative solutions and a better experience for our customers, (ii) allow us to drive efficiencies across our internal processes, and (iii) allow us to accelerate growth of our small-balance lending business and our appraisal platform, Apprise by Walker Dunlop Apprise ).

The segments and related services are described in the following paragraphs. Capital Markets CM CM provides a comprehensive range of commercial real estate finance products to our customers, including Agency lending, debt brokerage, property sales, appraisal and valuation services, and real estate related investment banking and advisory services, including housing market research.

 Agency Lending We are one of the leading lenders with the Agencies, where we originate and sell multifamily, manufactured housing communities, student housing, affordable housing, seniors housing, and small-balance multifamily loans. For additional information on our Agency lending services, refer to Item 1. Business in our 2023 Form 10-K. We recognize Loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net and the Fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net from our lending with the Agencies when we commit to both originate a loan with a borrower and sell that loan to an investor. The loan origination and debt brokerage fees, net and the fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net for these transactions reflect the fair value attributable to loan origination fees, premiums on the sale of loans, net of any co-broker fees, and the fair value of the expected net cash flows associated with servicing the loans, net of any guaranty obligations retained. We generally fund our Agency loan products through warehouse facility financing and sell them to investors in accordance with the related loan sale commitment, which we obtain concurrent with rate lock. Proceeds from the sale of the loan are used to pay off the warehouse facility borrowing. The sale of the loan is typically completed within 60 days after the loan is closed. We earn net warehouse interest income or expense from loans held for sale while they are outstanding equal to the difference between the note rate on the loan and the cost of borrowing of the warehouse facility. Our cost of borrowing can exceed the note rate on the loan, resulting in a net interest expense. Our loan commitments and loans held for sale are currently not exposed to unhedged interest rate risk during the loan commitment, closing, and delivery process. The sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated at the same time we establish the coupon rate for the loan. We also seek to mitigate the risk of a loan not closing by collecting good faith deposits from the borrower. The deposit is returned to the borrower only after the loan is closed. Any potential loss from a catastrophic change in the property condition while the loan is held for sale using warehouse facility financing is mitigated through property insurance equal to replacement cost. We are also protected contractually from an investor s failure to purchase the loan. We have experienced an immaterial number of failed deliveries in our history and have incurred immaterial losses on such failed deliveries. We may be obligated to repurchase loans that are originated for the Agencies programs if certain representations and warranties that we provide in connection with such originations are breached. As part of our overall growth strategy, we are focused on significantly growing and investing in our small-balance multifamily lending platform, which involves a high volume of transactions with smaller loan balances. We have supported our small-balance lending platform with acquisitions in the past that have provided data analytics and further advanced our technology development capabilities in this area. Debt Brokerage Our mortgage bankers who focus on debt brokerage are engaged by borrowers to work with a variety of institutional lenders, banks, and various other institutional lenders to find the most appropriate debt and/or equity solution for the borrowers needs. These financing solutions are then funded directly by the lender, and we receive an origination fee for our services. On occasion, we service the loans after they are originated by the lender. Property Sales Through our subsidiary Walker Dunlop Investment Sales WDIS ), we offer property sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily and hospitality properties that are seeking to sell these properties. Through these property sales brokerage services, we seek to maximize proceeds and certainty of closure for our clients using our knowledge of the commercial real estate and capital markets and relying on our experienced transaction professionals. We receive a sales commission for brokering the sale of these assets on behalf of our clients, and we often are able to provide financing for the purchaser of the properties through our Agency or debt brokerage teams. We have increased the number of property sales brokers and the geographical reach of our investment sales platform over the past several years through hiring and acquisitions and intend to continue this expansion in support of our growth strategy, geographical reach, and service offerings. Our geographical reach now covers many major markets in the United States, and our service offerings now include sales of land, student, senior housing, hospitality, and affordable properties.

 Housing Market Research and Real Estate Investment Banking Services Our subsidiary Zelman Associates Zelman ), is a nationally recognized housing market research and investment banking firm that enhances the information we provide to our clients and increases our access to high-quality market insights in many areas of the housing market, including construction trends, demographics, housing demand and mortgage finance. Zelman generates revenues through the sale of its housing market research data and related publications to banks, investment banks and other financial institutions. Zelman is also a leading independent investment bank providing comprehensive M A advisory services and capital markets solutions to our clients within the housing and commercial real estate sectors. As part of our growth strategy, we have increased the number of investment bankers to broaden our reach and expertise within the residential housing, building products, multifamily and commercial real estate sectors. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, we owned a 75 controlling interest in Zelman. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we purchased the remaining 25 interest in Zelman. Appraisal and Valuation Services We offer multifamily appraisal and valuation services though our subsidiary, Apprise. Apprise leverages technology and data science to dramatically improve the consistency, transparency, and speed of multifamily property appraisals in the U.S. through our proprietary technology and provides appraisal services to a client list that includes many national commercial real estate lenders. Apprise also provides quarterly and annual valuation services to some of the largest institutional commercial real estate investors in the country. We have increased the number of valuation specialists and the geographical reach of our appraisal platform over the past several years through hiring and recruiting in support of our long-term growth strategy. The growth strategy has resulted in an increase in our market share of the appraisal market over the past several years. Additionally, these valuation specialists provide support for and insight to our Agency lending and property sales professionals. Servicing Asset Management SAM SAM focuses on servicing and asset-managing the portfolio of loans we originate and sell to the Agencies, broker to certain life insurance companies, and originate through our principal lending and investing activities, and managing third-party capital invested in tax credit equity funds focused on the affordable housing sector and other commercial real estate. We earn servicing fees for overseeing the loans in our servicing portfolio and asset management fees for the capital invested in our funds. Additionally, we earn revenue through net interest income on the loans and the warehouse interest expense for loans held for investment. The primary services within SAM are described below. For additional information on our SAM services, refer to Item 1. Business in our 2023 Form 10-K. Loan Servicing We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all of our Agency loan products that we originate and sell and generate cash revenues from the fees we receive for servicing the loans, from the placement fees on escrow deposits held on behalf of borrowers, and from other ancillary fees relating to servicing the loans. Servicing fees, which are based on servicing fee rates set at the time an investor agrees to purchase the loan and on the unpaid principal balance of the loan, are generally paid monthly for the duration of the loan. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac servicing arrangements generally provide for prepayment protection to us in the event of a voluntary prepayment. For loans serviced outside of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we typically do not have similar prepayment protections. For most loans we service under the Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing DUS program, we are required to advance the principal and interest payments and guarantee fees for four months should a borrower cease making payments under the terms of their loan, including while that loan is in forbearance. After advancing for four months, we may request reimbursement by Fannie Mae for the principal and interest advances, and Fannie Mae will reimburse us for these advances within 60 days of the request. Under the Ginnie Mae program, we are obligated to advance the principal and interest payments and guarantee fees until the HUD loan is brought current, fully paid or assigned to HUD. We are eligible to assign a loan to HUD once it is in default for 30 days. If the loan is not brought current, or the loan otherwise defaults, we are not reimbursed for our advances until such time as we assign the loan to HUD or work out a payment modification for the borrower. For loans in default, we may repurchase those loans out of the Ginnie Mae security, at which time our advance requirements cease, and we may then modify and resell the loan or assign the loan back to HUD and be reimbursed for our advances. We are not obligated to make advances on the loans we service u nder the Freddie Mac Optigo program and our bank and life insurance company servicing agreements. We have risk-sharing obligations on substantially all loans we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program. When a Fannie Mae DUS loan is subject to full risk-sharing, we absorb losses on the first 5 of the unpaid principal balance of a loan at the time of loss settlement, and above 5 we share a percentage of the loss with Fannie Mae, with our maximum loss capped at 20 of the original unpaid principal balance of the loan (subject to doubling or tripling if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if the loan defaults within 12 months of its sale to Fannie Mae). Our full risk-sharing is currently limited to loans up to 300 million, which equates to a maximum loss per loan of 60 million (such exposure would occur in the event that the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss). 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 For loans in excess of 300 million, we receive modified risk-sharing. We also may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination on loans below 300 million, which reduces our potential risk-sharing losses from the levels described above if we do not believe that we are being fully compensated for the risks of the transaction. The full risk-sharing limit has varied over time. Accordingly, loans originated in prior periods may have been subject to modified risk-sharing at much lower levels. Our servicing fees for risk-sharing loans include compensation for the risk-sharing obligations and are larger than the servicing fees we would receive from Fannie Mae for loans with no risk-sharing obligations. We receive a lower servicing fee for modified risk-sharing than for full risk-sharing. For brokered loans we also service, we collect ongoing servicing fees while those loans remain in our servicing portfolio. The servicing fees we typically earn on brokered loan transactions are substantially lower than the servicing fees we earn on Agency loans. Investment Management and Principal Lending and Investing Investment Management Through our subsidiary, WDIP, we function as the operator of a private commercial real estate investment adviser focused on the management of debt, preferred equity, and mezzanine equity investments in middle-market commercial real estate funds. WDIP s current regulatory assets under management AUM of 2.0 billion primarily consist of six investment vehicles: Fund III, Fund IV, Fund V, Fund VI, Fund VII (collectively, the Funds ), and separate accounts managed primarily for life insurance companies. AUM for the Funds and for the separate accounts consists of both unfunded commitments and funded investments. Unfunded commitments are highest during the fundraising and investment phases. WDIP receives management fees based on both unfunded commitments and funded investments. Additionally, with respect to the Funds, WDIP receives a percentage of the return above the fund return hurdle rate specified in the fund agreements. Through a joint venture with an affiliate of Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc., WDIP also offers short-term senior secured debt financing products that provide floating-rate, interest-only loans for terms of generally up to three years to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing (the Interim Program JV or the joint venture ). The joint venture funds its operations using a combination of equity contributions from its owners and third-party credit facilities. We hold a 15 ownership interest in the Interim Program JV and are responsible for sourcing, underwriting, servicing, and asset-managing the loans originated by the joint venture. The Interim Program JV assumes full risk of loss while the loans it originates are outstanding, while we assume risk commensurate with our 15 ownership interest. Principal Lending and Investing Using a combination of our own capital and warehouse debt financing, we offer interim loans that do not meet the criteria of the Interim Program JV (the Interim Loan Program ). We underwrite, service, and asset-manage all loans executed through the Interim Loan Program. We originate and hold these Interim Loan Program loans for investment, which are included on our balance sheet, and during the time that these loans are outstanding, we assume the full risk of loss. We have steadily reduced interim loan originations in order to focus on raising third-party capital solutions to meet market demand and pursue our investment management growth strategy. In the fourth quarter of 2023, WDIP launched a credit fund focused on transitional lending with a large, institutional insurance company. The credit fund focuses on the same core product as the Interim Loan Program and Interim Program JV, and we expect to further wind down our reliance on the Interim Loan Program and Interim Program JV as a result of launching this credit fund. The Company underwrites, services, and asset manages all loans originated for the credit fund and has a 5 co-investment obligation. WDIP also receives a percentage of the return above the fund return hurdle rate specified in the fund operating agreements. Affordable Housing Real Estate Services We provide affordable housing investment management and real estate services through our subsidiaries, collectively known as Walker Dunlop Affordable Equity programs WDAE ). WDAE is one of the largest tax credit syndicators and affordable housing developers in the U.S. and provides alternative investment management services focused on the affordable housing sector through LIHTC syndication, development of affordable housing projects through joint ventures, and affordable housing preservation fund management. Our affordable housing investment management team works with our developer clients to identify properties that will generate LIHTCs and meet our affordable investors needs, and forms limited partnership funds LIHTC funds with third-party investors that invest in the limited partnership interests in these properties. WDAE serves as the general partner of these LIHTC funds, and it receives fees, such as asset management fees, and a portion of refinance and disposition proceeds as compensation for its work as the general partner of the fund. Additionally, WDAE earns a syndication fee from the LIHTC funds for the identification, organization, and acquisition of affordable housing projects that generate LIHTCs.

Table of Contents 
 We invest, as the managing or non-managing member of joint ventures, with developers of affordable housing projects that are partially funded through LIHTCs. When possible, WDAE syndicates the LIHTC investment necessary to build properties through these joint venture partnerships. The joint ventures earn developer fees, and we receive the portion of the economic benefits commensurate with our investment in the joint ventures, including cash flows from operations and sale/refinance. Additionally, WDAE invests with third-party investors (either in a fund or joint-venture structure) with the goal of preserving affordability on multifamily properties coming out of the LIHTC 15-year compliance period or on which market forces are unlikely to keep the properties affordable. Corporate The Corporate segment consists primarily of our treasury operations and other corporate-level activities. Our treasury operations include monitoring and managing our liquidity and funding requirements, including our corporate debt. Other major corporate-level functions include our equity-method investments, accounting, information technology, legal, human resources, marketing, internal audit, and various other corporate groups. Basis of Presentation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and all intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Critical Accounting Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), which requires management to make estimates based on certain judgments and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and the use of different judgments and assumptions may have a material impact on our results. The following critical accounting estimates involve significant estimation uncertainty that may have or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Additional information about our critical accounting estimates and other significant accounting policies is discussed in NOTE 2 of the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs ). MSRs are recorded at fair value at loan sale. The fair value at loan sale is based on estimates of expected net cash flows associated with the servicing rights and takes into consideration an estimate of loan prepayment. Initially, the fair value amount is included as a component of the derivative asset fair value at the loan commitment date. The estimated net cash flows from servicing, which includes assumptions for discount rate, placement fees, prepayment speed, and servicing costs, are discounted at a rate that reflects the credit and liquidity risk of the MSR over the estimated life of the underlying loan. The discount rates used throughout the periods presented for all MSRs were between 8-14 and varied based on the loan type. The life of the underlying loan is estimated giving consideration to the prepayment provisions in the loan and assumptions about loan behaviors around those provisions. Our model for MSRs assumes no prepayment prior to the expiration of the prepayment provisions and full prepayment of the loan at or near the point when the prepayment provisions have expired. The estimated net cash flows also include cash flows related to the future placement fees on deposit accounts associated with servicing the loans that are based on an earnings rate assumption. We include a servicing cost assumption to account for our expected costs to service a loan. The servicing cost assumption has had a de minimis impact on the estimate historically. We record an individual MSR asset for each loan at loan sale. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of capitalized MSRs are developed internally and are periodically compared to assumptions used by other market participants. Due to the relatively few transactions in the multifamily MSR market and the lack of significant changes in assumptions by market participants, we have experienced limited volatility in the assumptions historically, including the assumption that most significantly impacts the estimate: the discount rate. We do not expect to see significant volatility in the assumptions for the foreseeable future. We actively monitor the assumptions used and make adjustments to those assumptions when market conditions change, or other factors indicate such adjustments are warranted. Over the past three years, we have adjusted the placement fee assumption related to escrow deposits several times to reflect the current and expected future earnings rate projected for the life of the MSR. Subsequent to loan origination, the carrying value of the MSR is amortized over the expected life of the loan. We engage a third party on a semi-annual basis to assist with performing a fair value assessment of our servicing portfolio, primarily for financial statement disclosure purposes. Changes in our discount rate assumptions may materially impact the fair value of the MSRs (NOTE 3 of the condensed consolidated financial statements details the portfolio-level impact of a change in the discount rate).

 Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligations. This reserve liability (referred to as allowance for risk-sharing obligations relates to our Fannie Mae at-risk servicing portfolio and is presented as a separate liability on our balance sheets. We record an estimate of the loss reserve for the current expected credit losses CECL for all loans in our Fannie Mae at-risk servicing portfolio. For those loans that are collectively evaluated, we use the weighted-average remaining maturity method WARM to calculate an estimated loss CECL allowance ). WARM uses an average annual loss rate that contains loss content over multiple vintages and loan terms and is used as a foundation for estimating the CECL allowance. The average annual loss rate is applied to the estimated unpaid principal balance over the contractual term, adjusted for estimated prepayments and amortization to arrive at the CECL allowance for the portion of the portfolio collectively evaluated as described further below. One of the key components of a WARM calculation is the runoff rate, which is the expected rate at which loans in the current portfolio will amortize and prepay in the future based on our historical prepayment and amortization experience. We group loans by similar origination dates (vintage) and contractual maturity terms for purposes of calculating the runoff rate. We originate loans under the DUS program with various terms generally ranging from several years to 15 years; each of these various loan terms has a different runoff rate. The runoff rates applied to each vintage and contractual maturity term are determined using historical data; however, changes in prepayment and amortization behavior may significantly impact the estimate. We have not experienced significant changes in the runoff rate since we implemented CECL in 2020. The weighted-average annual loss rate is calculated using a 10-year look-back period, utilizing the average portfolio balance and settled losses for each year. A 10-year period is used as we believe that this period of time includes sufficiently different economic conditions to generate a reasonable estimate of expected results in the future, given the relatively long-term nature of the current portfolio. As the weighted-average annual loss rate utilizes a rolling 10-year look-back period, the loss rate used in the estimate will change as loss data from earlier periods in the look-back period continue to fall off and as new loss data are added. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, loss data from earlier periods in the look-back period with significantly higher losses fell off and were replaced with more recent loss data with significantly lower losses, resulting in the weighted-average annual loss rate declining from 0.6 basis points to 0.3 basis points. We currently use one year for our reasonable and supportable forecast period forecast period as we believe forecasts beyond one year are inherently less reliable. During the forecast period we apply an adjusted loss factor based on generally available economic and unemployment forecasts and a blended loss rate from historical periods that we believe reflect the forecasts. We revert to the historical loss rate over a one-year period on a straight-line basis. Over the past couple of years, the loss rate used in the forecast period reflects our expectations of the economic conditions impacting the multifamily sector over the coming year in relation to the historical period. For example, despite our historical loss rate declining from 0.6 basis points as of December 31, 2023 to 0.3 basis points as of March 31, 2024, our forecast-period loss rate remained relatively unchanged from 2.4 basis points as of December 31, 2023, to 2.3 basis points as of March 31, 2024. The forecast loss rate remaining the same reflects our relatively unchanged view of the uncertainty of the evolving macroeconomic conditions facing the multifamily sector. NOTE 4 of the condensed consolidated financial statements outlines adjustments made in the loss rates used to account for the expected economic conditions as of a given period and the related impact on the estimate. Changes in our expectations and forecasts have materially impacted, and in the future may materially impact, these inputs and the CECL allowance. We evaluate our risk-sharing loans on a quarterly basis to determine whether there are loans that are probable of foreclosure. Specifically, we assess a loan s qualitative and quantitative risk factors, such as payment status, property financial performance, local real estate market conditions, loan-to-value ratio, debt-service-coverage ratio, and property condition. When a loan is determined to be probable of foreclosure based on these factors (or has foreclosed), we remove the loan from the WARM calculation and individually assess the loan for potential credit loss. This assessment requires certain judgments and assumptions to be made regarding the property values and other factors, which may differ significantly from actual results. Loss settlement with Fannie Mae has historically concluded within 18 to 36 months after foreclosure. Historically, the initial collateral-based reserves have not varied significantly from the final settlement. We actively monitor the judgments and assumptions used in our Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligation estimate and make adjustments to those assumptions when market conditions change, or when other factors indicate such adjustments are warranted. We believe the level of Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligation is appropriate based on our expectations of future market conditions; however, changes in one or more of the judgments or assumptions used above could have a significant impact on the estimate.

 Contingent Consideration Liabilities. The Company often includes an earnout as part of the consideration paid for acquisitions to align the long-term interests of the acquiree with those of the Company. These earnouts contain milestones for achievement, which typically are revenue, revenue-like, or productivity measurements. If the milestone is achieved, the acquiree is paid the additional consideration. Upon acquisition, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of the earnout and include that fair value measurement as a component of the total consideration paid in the calculation of goodwill. The fair value of the earnout is recorded as a contingent consideration liability and is included within Other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and adjusted to the estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period. The determination of the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities requires significant management judgment and unobservable inputs to (i) determine forecasts and scenarios of future revenues, net cash flows and certain other performance metrics, (ii) assign a probability of achievement for the forecasts and scenarios, and (iii) select a discount rate. A Monte Carlo simulation analysis is used to determine many iterations of potential fair values. The average of these iterations is then used to determine the estimated fair value. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to assist with the fair value estimation. The probability of the earnout achievement is based on management s estimate of the expected future performance and other financial metrics of each of the acquired entities, which are subject to significant uncertainty. Changes to the aforementioned inputs impact the estimate; for example, in 2023, we recorded a 62.5 million reduction to the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities based on revised management forecasts, scenarios, and other valuation inputs. The aggregate fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was 79.4 million. This fair value represents management s best estimate of the discounted cash payments that will be made in the future for all of our contingent consideration arrangements. The maximum remaining undiscounted earnout payments as of September 30, 2024 was 258.5 million. In prior years, we made two large acquisitions that included significant amounts of contingent consideration to maximize alignment of the key principals and management teams. Goodwill. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we reported goodwill of 901.7 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit to which the acquisition relates. Goodwill is recognized as an asset and is reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1. Between annual impairment analyses, we perform an evaluation of recoverability, when events and circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Impairment testing requires an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if there are indicators of potential impairment, followed by, if necessary, an assessment of quantitative factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether there has been a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset and/or significant or adverse changes in cash flow projections or earnings forecasts. These assessments require management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates about projected cash flows, discount rates and other factors. Due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions in 2023, the projected cash flows for some of our reporting units declined, resulting in goodwill impairment in 2023 of 62.0 million that was attributed to reporting units within the Capital Markets segment. Due to improving macroeconomic conditions, as of September 30, 2024, there are no indicators of goodwill impairment; however, improvements in the macroeconomic conditions remain slow and may indicate additional goodwill impairment as we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis.

 Overview of Current Business Environment In 2022 and 2023, inflation surged past historical norms, prompting the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC to aggressively raise the target Federal Funds Rate from near zero in March 2022 to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 by July 2023. This rapid increase, alongside high inflation and an uncertain economic outlook, led to substantial volatility in the capital markets, resulting in higher interest rates and reduced capital supply, trends that persisted into the first half of 2024. The commercial real estate sector is dependent on stable capital costs and available capital and experienced a notable decline in transaction activity, impacting our overall business performance in the first half of 2024. The economy remains robust, with GDP and employment data showing resilience, while inflation has slowed considerably this year. In light of these conditions, the FOMC signaled it was nearing the end of its restrictive monetary policy throughout the second quarter of 2024. The shift in policy helped reduce market volatility, stabilize interest rates, and improve capital supply entering the second half of 2024. Consequently, our transaction activity rose by 37 quarter on quarter, signaling signs of a market recovery. In September 2024, the FOMC reduced the Fed Funds Rate by 0.50 , to 4.75 to 5.00 , further solidifying the near-term path for interest rates. Improved macroeconomic conditions led to increased transaction volumes for our business during the third quarter of 2024, which surged to 11.6 billion, our highest quarterly total in nearly two years, with notable increases in property sales (44 ), Brokered (28 and GSE (26 transaction volumes compared to the third quarter last year. The multifamily property sales market was significantly disrupted by rapidly rising rates and a tighter supply of capital during the past two years. With supportive conditions in the third quarter 2024, our property sales volume surged to 3.6 billion, more than we closed for the first two quarters of the year combined. Increased transactions in the multifamily property sales sector provided a boost to the debt financing market as many acquisitions rely on debt financing. Consequently, we experienced a significant increase in GSE lending volumes this quarter to 3.5 billion, up 33 from the second quarter 2024. As the supply of third-party capital to commercial real estate continues to improve, life insurance companies, banks, and CMBS lenders increased their transaction activity, contributing to a 5 rise in our debt brokerage volumes compared to the second quarter 2024. We anticipate long-term interest rates will remain stable, encouraging further adjustments in capital flow and gradually boosting transaction activity in the coming quarters. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) forecasts multifamily lending will rise to 339 billion in 2024, a 25 increase from 271 billion in 2023. For this forecast to hold true, liquidity and interest rates must remain stable, promoting continued growth in the property sales sector and underlying debt financing markets, particularly our GSE lending executions, both of which we expect to remain elevated in the fourth quarter. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) set the 2024 loan origination caps for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at 70 billion each, a 7 decrease from 2023 but a 38 increase over actual 2023 lending volumes. For the year to date period ended September 30, 2024, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported multifamily origination volumes of 32.5 billion and 35.1 billion, respectively, reflecting a 22 decrease and an 8 increase, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023, but leaving 72.4 billion in combined available lending capacity for the fourth quarter of 2024. A large number of new multifamily properties were completed in 2023, primarily in sunbelt markets, and a near record 600,000 units are expected to be delivered this year. The increase in completions this year has presented an opportunity for our multifamily property sales team, as many builders look to sell stabilized assets. We are actively competing for market share, as customers increasingly seek experienced brokers to maximize value. Macroeconomic conditions for multifamily properties remain stable. The national unemployment rate remains low at 4.1 in September 2024. According to RealPage, vacancies stabilized around 5.6 as of September 2024, down from 5.8 in December 2023 and consistent with September 2023. Despite the large supply of new units this year, many properties and regions across the U.S. continue growing rents with Zelman, our housing research arm, predicting national rent growth of approximately 2 this year. Beyond 2024, multifamily completions are anticipated to decrease significantly due to stalled new construction starts in 2023 and 2024, largely driven by tighter liquidity and the aforementioned macroeconomic challenges during the last two years. Long term, we believe the fundamentals for multifamily properties will trend positively due to constrained supply resulting from reduced construction starts, recent negative trends in household formation and a lack of entry-level single-family homes driving strong demand for rental housing in many areas. That will continue to position multifamily assets as an attractive investment option, benefitting our property sales, GSE lending and HUD lending operations. We initiated the Interim Program Joint Venture to enhance our capacity for originating Interim Program loans beyond our own balance sheet. Over the past two years, we have shifted our transitional lending strategy towards our investment management platform and our registered investment adviser, WDIP. In light of increased distress in the transitional lending market, especially within CLOs, we are actively raising capital to address market demand as these loans mature in 2024 and 2025. Our first credit fund, launched in the fourth quarter of 2023, 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 successfully raised 150 million from a prominent life insurance company, enabling WDIP to deploy nearly half a billion dollars of leveraged capital to the transitional multifamily lending market this year. We are continuing to raise additional capital to support this strategy, with WDIP underwriting, servicing and managing all loans originated for the credit fund, while maintaining only a 5 co-investment obligation from the Company. Through our subsidiary, WDAE, we provide alternative investment management services focused on affordable housing, including LIHTC syndication, joint venture development, and community preservation fund management. We ranked as the eighth largest LIHTC syndicator in 2023 and continue to pursue combined LIHTC syndication and affordable housing services to generate significant long-term financing, property sales, and syndication opportunities. Additionally, the FHFA s 2024 loan origination caps of 140 billion require that at least 50 of the GSEs multifamily business target affordable housing. We anticipate these initiatives, combined with ongoing demand for affordable housing, will create growth opportunities for both WDAE and our debt financing and property sales teams focused on this sector.

Origination fees increased primarily due to the increase in our debt financing volumes. MSR income increased mostly due to an increase in our Agency debt financing volume. Servicing fees increased primarily due to the increase in the size of our GSE servicing portfolio. The increase in property sales broker fees was largely driven by an increase in property sales volume. Investment management fees decreased largely as a result of a decline in asset management fees from our LIHTC operations. Other revenues decreased primarily due to lower syndication and other revenues from our LIHTC operations. The increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel expense, provision (benefit) for credit losses, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, and other operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in goodwill impairment. Personnel expense increased primarily due to an increase in commission costs due to the aforementioned increase in debt financing volume and origination fees. The increase in provision for credit losses was mainly attributable to an increase in the estimated fair value of the liability associated with a loan forbearance and indemnification agreement with Freddie Mac entered into during the first quarter of 2024. The period-over-period change in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities increased expenses as the fair value adjustments made to contingent consideration liabilities in the third quarter of 2024 were associated with a much smaller acquisition than those made in the prior year. Other operating expenses increased due to increases in professional fees, office expenses, and miscellaneous expenses. Goodwill impairment decreased due to a goodwill impairment triggering event that occurred in the third quarter of 2023, with no similar event in occurring in the third quarter of 2024.

 The increase in income tax expense was primarily by the 33 increase in income from operations. Partially, offsetting the increase in income tax expense was a lower estimated annual effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 1.1 million tax adjustment to our international tax accruals due to a lower than estimated amount of taxes in our 2022 return, which was recently filed timely.

Origination fees increased primarily due to the increase in debt financing volumes. Servicing fees increased primarily due to the increase in the size of our GSE servicing portfolio. Placement fees and other interest income increased primarily as a result of a higher placement fee rate due to a higher short-term interest rate environment. MSR income decreased largely due to a decrease in Fannie Mae debt financing volume. Investment management fees decreased largely as a result of a decline in asset management fees from our LIHTC operations. Other revenues declined primarily due to a decline in investment banking revenues and a decrease in syndication and other revenues from our LIHTC operations . The increase in expenses was primarily due to a significant change in the provision (benefit) for credit losses and increases in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities, interest expense on corporate debt, and other operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in goodwill impairment. Provision (benefit) for credit losses switched from a large benefit in 2023 to a provision in 2024. The provision for credit losses in 2024 was primarily attributable to losses related to the forbearance and indemnification agreements with Freddie Mac discussed in NOTE 2. The benefit for credit losses in 2023 was primarily due to the annual update of our historical loss rate that resulted in a large decrease to the calculated expected credit losses. The period-over-period change in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities increased expenses as the fair value adjustments made to contingent consideration liabilities in 2024 were associated with a much 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 smaller acquisition than those made in the prior year. Interest expense on corporate debt increased largely due to an increase in the interest rate on the debt as its floating rate is tied to short-term interest rates, which were higher overall in 2024 than 2023. Other operating expenses increased largely as a result of increased travel and entertainment mostly related to our all-company meeting, with no comparable activity in 2023, software costs associated with automation efforts, and miscellaneous expenses. Goodwill impairment decreased due to a goodwill impairment triggering event that occurred in the third quarter of 2023, with no similar event in occurring in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in income tax expense was principally driven by the 20 decrease in income from operations and a 1.1 million tax adjustment to our international tax accruals due to a lower than estimated amount of taxes in our 2022 return, which was recently filed timely. A discussion of the financial results for our segments is included further below. Non-GAAP Financial Measure To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, readers should use adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before income taxes, interest expense on our corporate debt, and amortization and depreciation, adjusted for provision (benefit) for credit losses, net write-offs, stock-based incentive compensation charges, the fair value of expected net cash flows from servicing, net, the write off of the unamortized balance of premium associated with the repayment of a portion of our corporate debt, goodwill impairment, and contingent consideration liability fair value adjustments when the fair value adjustment is a triggering event for a goodwill impairment assessment. In cases where the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration liabilities is a trigger for goodwill impairment, the goodwill impairment is netted against the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration liabilities and included as a net number. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges that are used to determine compliance with financial covenants. We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provides useful information to investors by offering: 
 the ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating results; the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses; and a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business. 
 We believe that adjusted EBITDA has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with net income on both a consolidated and segment basis. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net income as follows:

Servicing fees increased largely due to growth in the average servicing portfolio period over period. Property sales broker fees increased as a result of the growth in property sales volume. Investment management fees decreased due to a decline in asset management fees from our LIHTC operations . Other revenues decreased due to lower syndication and other revenues from our LIHTC operations. Net write-offs decreased due to the size of loss settlement, as we had a larger loss settlement on a loan in our at-risk portfolio during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2024. Other operating expenses increased due to increases in professional fees, office expenses, and miscellaneous expenses.

 (1) The net write-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes the 6.0 million write-off of a collateral-based reserve related to a loan held for investment during the second quarter of 2023. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 Origination fees increased due to the increase in debt financing volume. Servicing fees increased largely due to growth in the average servicing portfolio period over period. Investment management fees decreased due to a decline in asset management fees from our LIHTC operations . Placement fees and other interest income increased largely as result of higher placement fee rates due to a higher short-term interest rate environment. Other revenues declined mostly due to decreases in investment banking revenues and syndication and other revenues from our LIHTC operations. Personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in commission costs. Net write-offs decreased due to the size and number of loss settlements, as we had two loss settlements with larger losses in 2023 compared to one small loss settlement in 2024. Other operating expenses increased largely as a result of increased (i) travel and entertainment mostly related to our all-company meeting, with no comparable activity in 2023, (ii) software costs associated with automation efforts, and (iii) miscellaneous expenses. Financial Condition Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are generated from loan sales, servicing fees, placement fees, net warehouse interest income (expense), property sales broker fees, investment management fees, research subscription fees, investment banking advisory fees, and other income, net of loan originations and operating costs. Our cash flows from operations are impacted by the fees generated by our loan originations and property sales, the timing of loan closings, and the period of time loans are held for sale in the warehouse loan facility prior to delivery to the investor. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows from investing activities include capital expenditures, the funding and repayment of loans held for investment, contributions to and distributions from joint ventures, purchases of equity-method investments, cash paid for acquisitions, and the purchase of available-for-sale AFS securities pledged to Fannie Mae. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We use our warehouse loan facilities and, when necessary, our corporate cash to fund loan closings, both for loans held for sale and loans held for investment. We believe that our current warehouse loan facilities are adequate to meet our loan origination needs. Historically, we have used a combination of long-term debt and cash flows from operating activities to fund large acquisitions. Additionally, we repurchase shares, pay cash dividends, make long-term debt principal payments, and repay short-term borrowings on a regular basis. We issue stock primarily in connection with the exercise of stock options (cash inflow) and occasionally for acquisitions (non-cash transactions).

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following table presents a period-to-period comparison of the significant components of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF CASH FLOWS 

For the nine months ended September 30, Dollar Percentage (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (401,458) (332,412) (69,046) 21 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (37,143) 146,569 (183,712) (125) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 313,838 228,207 85,631 38 Total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents at end of period 266,640 300,647 (34,007) (11) Cash provided by (used in) operating activities Net receipt (use) of cash for loan origination activity (441,774) (378,891) (62,883) 17 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, excluding loan origination activity 40,316 46,479 (6,163) (13) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities Purchases of pledged AFS securities (20,900) (20,900) N/A Originations and repurchase of loans held for investment (25,619) (366) (25,253) 6,900 Principal collected on loans held for investment 17,659 161,167 (143,508) (89) Cash provided by from (used in) financing activities Borrowings (repayments) of warehouse notes payable, net 452,497 387,109 65,388 17 Repayments of interim warehouse notes payable (13,884) (119,835) 105,951 (88) Repayments of notes payable (6,013) (120,046) 114,033 (95) Repurchase of common stock (12,012) (18,928) 6,916 (37) Borrowings of note payable 196,000 (196,000) (100) Payment of contingent consideration (34,317) (26,090) (8,227) 32 Purchase of noncontrolling interest (5,000) (5,000) N/A Operating Activities Cash provided by (used in) operating activities changed due to: (i) Loan origination activity . Agency loans originated are held for short periods of time, generally less than 60 days, and impact cash flows presented as of a point in time due to the timing difference between the date of origination and date of delivery. The increase in net cash used in loan origination activities is primarily attributable to originations outpacing sales by 441.8 million in 2024 compared to 378.9 million in 2023. (ii) Other activities . Cash flows provided by other operating activities were 40.3 million in 2024, down from 46.5 million in 2023. The primary reason for the change was a change in the adjustment for credit losses. The provision (benefit) for credit losses was a 6.3 million positive adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an 11.1 million negative adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This positive benefit to cash from operating activities was partially offset by a 9.2 million increase in other operating activities, net and a 14.3 million decrease in net income. 
 Investing Activities Cash provided by (used in) investing activities changed due to: (i) AFS securities . Purchases of AFS securities increased during 2024 as we reinvested proceeds from the prepayment of AFS securities. 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 (ii) Principal collected on loans held for investment. The principal collected on loans held of investment decreased, as we have been winding down our Interim Loan Program ILP loans over the past several years. As of the beginning of 2024, we only had two ILP loans compared to nine loans as of the beginning of 2023. (iii) Originations and repurchase of loans held for investment. The increase was due to an Agency loan repurchase during 2024 with no comparable activity in 2023 and the origination of a short-term bridge loan during 2024 compared to minimal originations in 2023. 
 Financing Activities Cash provided by (used in) financing activities changed due to: (i) Net borrowings of warehouse notes payable. The increase was due to the aforementioned increase in cash used in loan origination activity. (ii) Repayments of interim warehouse notes payable. The decrease was due to the aforementioned decrease in net principal collected on loans held for investment. (iii) Repayments of notes payable. In 2023, we had an additional borrowing under our Term Loan (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources below), a portion of which was used to repay a note payable at one of our subsidiaries, with no comparable activity in 2024. The activity in 2024 represents routine quarterly principal payments on our Term Loan. (iv) Repurchase of common stock. The decrease in repurchases of common stock was related to a decrease in the number and value of employee stock vesting events related to previously issued equity grants under our various share-based compensation plans. 
 Partially offsetting the aforementioned changes that increased cash were the following activities that decreased cash: (i) Borrowings of note payable . The decrease was attributable to an additional borrowing under our Term Loan (as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources below) in 2023, with no comparable activity in 2024. (ii) Payment of contingent consideration. The increase was due to earnout targets being met by one of our larger contingent consideration liabilities at a higher rate in 2024 than in 2023. (iii) Purchase of noncontrolling interest. This was a unique transaction in 2024 with no comparable activity in 2023. Segment Results The Company is managed based on our three reportable segments: (i) Capital Markets, (ii) Servicing Asset Management, and (iii) Corporate. The segment results below are intended to present each of the reportable segments on a stand-alone basis.

 (1) Origination fees as a percentage of total debt financing volume. (2) MSR income as a percentage of total debt financing volume, excluding the income and debt financing volume from principal lending and investing. (3) MSR income as a percentage of Agency debt financing volume. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in origination fees was the result of the increase in debt financing volume. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in origination fees was primarily driven by the increase in debt financing volume year over year, partially offset by a slight decline in our origination fee rate due to the shift in the mix of our debt financing volume towards brokered debt financing volume. See the Overview of Current Business Environment section above for a detailed discussion of the factors driving the change in debt financing activity. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in our MSR income was driven by the increase in Agency debt financing volume, partially offset by an 8-basis-point decrease in the Agency MSR rate, largely driven by a decrease in FNMA loans as a percentage of Agency debt financing volume during the quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decreases in MSR income and Agency MSR rate were driven primarily by the 17 decrease in Fannie Mae debt financing volume shown above. Fannie Mae volume as a percentage of total transaction volume decreased from 30 in 2023 to 22 in 2024. Fannie Mae loans produce higher MSR income compared to our other product types, due to their higher weighted average servicing fees. Property sales broker fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, t he increase was the result of the 44 increase in property sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the fee margin. Other revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, t he decrease was principally due to an 8.3 million decrease in investment banking revenues due to the closing of the largest investment banking advisory transaction in Company history during 2023 with no comparable activity in 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Expenses Personnel. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was due to a 5.8 million increase in commission costs due to higher origination fees and property sales broker fees and a 1.8 million increase in subjective bonus compensation expense due to the overall company performance during the quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was primarily the result of a 3.6 million decrease in salaries and benefits and stock compensation and a 2.6 million decrease in the subjective bonus compensation expense, all of which was primarily due to lower average segment headcount, partially offset a 2.4 million increase in commission costs due to higher origination fees. Interest expense on corporate debt. Interest expense on corporate debt is determined at a consolidated corporate level and allocated to each segment proportionally based on each segment s use of that corporate debt. The discussion of our consolidated results above has additional information related to the increase in interest expense on corporate debt. Goodwill Impairment. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, goodwill impairment decreased due to activity in fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities. The activity in 2023 was a triggering event for goodwill impairment assessment. There were no fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities in 2024 that were triggering events for a goodwill impairment assessment. Fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities . For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value adjustments made to the contingent consideration liabilities in 2024 were associated with a much smaller acquisition than those made in the prior year, leading to the increase in expenses year over year. Income tax expense (benefit) . Income tax expense (benefit) is determined at a consolidated corporate level and allocated to each segment proportionally based on each segment s income from operations, except for significant, one-time tax activities, which are allocated entirely to the segment impacted by the tax activity.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the average servicing portfolio period over period as shown below, slightly offset by a decline in the average servicing fee rate. The increase in the average servicing portfolio was driven by the 3.2 billion increase in Fannie Mae and the 1.4 billion increase in Freddie Mac loans serviced over the past year. The decrease in the average servicing fee rate was the result of the WASF on new debt financing volume being lower than the WASF for the loans paid off in the portfolio over the past year.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, investment management fees declined as investment management fees from our LIHTC operations decreased by 3.5 million, partially offset by a 1.9 million increase in investment management fees from our Principal Investing funds. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investment management fees decreased primarily due to a decline in investment management fees from our LIHTC operations of 5.6 million. The declines in investment management fees from our LIHTC funds were the result of lower accruals for the fees due to lower anticipated revenues for the year. Placement fees and other interest income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was driven primarily by an increase in our placement fees on escrow deposits of 11.1 million combined with a 1.6 million increase in investment interest income from 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 our pledged securities. The placement fee rates on escrow deposits increased as a result of a higher short-term interest rate environment in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Short-term interest rates were still rising in the first half of 2023 before stabilizing in the second half of the year and into 2024. Additionally, the average balance of escrow deposits increased 4 year over year. Other revenues. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other revenues decreased primarily due to a 3.0 million decrease in income from equity method investments, a 4.2 million reduction in syndication and other revenues related to a 78 decline in gross equity raised year over year as the closing of one of our LIHTC funds was delayed in the third quarter of 2024 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the other revenues decrease was largely driven by a 9.2 million decrease in syndication and other revenues related to a 50 decrease in gross equity raised year over year as the closing of one of our LIHTC funds was delayed in the third quarter of 2024 , partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in income from equity method investments. Expenses Personnel. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, personnel expense rose due to increases of 2.5 million and 5.4 million, respectively, in salaries and benefits due to increases in average segment headcount. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 only, the increase was also due to an increase in commission costs increased by 1.4 million. The increase in commission costs was due to the increased volume of committed investments in tax credit equity closed during the quarter that are awaiting syndication into LIHTC funds. Provision (benefit) for credit losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, provision (benefit) for credit losses increased primarily due to a 3.0 million increase in the fair value of our forbearance and indemnification agreement with Freddie Mac, with no comparable activity in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, provision (benefit) for credit losses switched from a large benefit in 2023 to a provision in 2024. The provision for credit losses in 2024 was primarily attributable to a 7.6 million provision related to the forbearance and indemnification agreements discussed in NOTE 2, with no comparable activity in 2023. The benefit for credit losses in 2023 was primarily due to the annual update of our historical loss rate that resulted in a large decrease to the calculated expected credit losses. The 2023 update resulted in the loss data from earlier periods within the historical lookback period falling off and being replaced with a period with significantly lower loss data, resulting in the historical loss rate decreasing substantially. Interest expense on corporate debt. Interest expense on corporate debt is determined at a consolidated corporate level and allocated to each segment proportionally based on each segment s use of that corporate debt. The discussion of our condensed consolidated results above has additional information related to the increase in interest expense on corporate debt. Other operating expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily the result of 1.9 million and 2.1 million, respectively, of costs associated with operating properties that we control through loan repurchase or indemnification, with no comparable activity in the prior year. Income tax expense . Income tax expense is determined at a consolidated corporate level and allocated to each segment proportionally based on each segment s income from operations, except for significant, one-time tax activities, which are allocated entirely to the segment impacted by the tax activity.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Uses of Liquidity, Cash and Cash Equivalents Our significant recurring cash flow requirements consist of liquidity to (i) fund loans held for sale; (ii) pay cash dividends; (iii) fund our portion of the equity necessary to support equity-method investments; (iv) fund investments in properties to be syndicated to LIHTC investment funds that we will asset-manage; (v) make payments related to earnouts from acquisitions, (vi) meet working capital needs to support our day-to-day operations, including debt service payments, joint venture development partnership contributions, advances for servicing and loan repurchases and payments for salaries, commissions, and income taxes, and (vii) meet working capital to satisfy collateral requirements for our Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing obligations and to meet the operational liquidity requirements of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, Ginnie Mae, and our warehouse facility lenders. Fannie Mae has established benchmark standards for capital adequacy and reserves the right to terminate our servicing authority for all or some of the portfolio if, at any time, it determines that our financial condition is not adequate to support our obligations under the DUS agreement. We are required to maintain acceptable net worth as defined in the standards, and we satisfied the requirements as of September 30, 2024. The net worth requirement is derived primarily from unpaid balances on Fannie Mae loans and the level of risk-sharing. As of September 30, 2024, the net worth requirement was 318.6 million, and our net worth was 936.7 million, as measured at our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Walker Dunlop, LLC. As of September 30, 2024, we were required to maintain at least 63.4 million of liquid assets to meet our operational liquidity requirements for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, Ginnie Mae and our warehouse facility lenders. As of September 30, 2024, we had operational liquidity of 155.7 million, as measured at our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Walker Dunlop, LLC. We paid a cash dividend of 0.65 per share during the third quarter of 2024, which is 3 higher than the quarterly dividend paid in the third quarter of 2023. On November 6, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.65 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. The dividend will be paid on December 6, 2024 to all holders of record of our restricted and unrestricted common stock as of November 22, 2024. In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that permits the repurchase of up to 75.0 million of shares of our common stock over a 12-month period beginning February 23, 2024. Through September 30, 2024, we have not repurchased any shares under the 2024 stock repurchase program and have 75.0 million of remaining capacity under that program. Historically, our cash flows from operations and warehouse facilities have been sufficient to enable us to meet our short-term liquidity needs and other funding requirements. We believe that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient for us to meet our current obligations for the foreseeable future. Restricted Cash and Pledged Securities Restricted cash consists primarily of good faith deposits held on behalf of borrowers between the time we enter into a loan commitment with the borrower and the investor purchases the loan. We are generally required to share the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, which is an off-balance sheet arrangement. We are required to secure this obligation by assigning collateral to Fannie Mae. We meet this obligation by assigning pledged securities to Fannie Mae. The amount of collateral required by Fannie Mae is a formulaic calculation at the loan level and considers the balance of the loan, the risk level of the loan, the age of the loan, and the level of risk-sharing. Fannie Mae requires collateral for Tier 2 loans of 75 basis points, which is funded over a 48-month period that begins upon delivery of the loan to Fannie Mae. Collateral held in the form of money market funds holding U.S. Treasuries is discounted 5 , and Agency MBS are discounted 4 for purposes of calculating compliance with the collateral requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we held substantially all of our restricted liquidity in Agency MBS in the aggregate amount of 156.9 million. Additionally, the majority of the loans for which we have risk-sharing are Tier 2 loans. We fund any growth in our Fannie Mae required operational liquidity and collateral requirements from our working capital. We are in compliance with the September 30, 2024 collateral requirements as outlined above. As of September 30, 2024, reserve requirements for the September 30, 2024 DUS loan portfolio will require us to fund 71.1 million in additional restricted liquidity over the next 48 months, assuming no further principal paydowns, prepayments, or defaults within our at-risk portfolio. Fannie Mae has assessed the DUS Capital Standards in the past and may make changes to these standards in the future. We generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to 

 60 

Table of Contents 
 meet these capital standards and do not expect any future changes to have a material impact on our future operations; however, any future changes to collateral requirements may adversely impact our available cash. Under the provisions of the DUS agreement, we must also maintain a certain level of liquid assets referred to as the operational and unrestricted portions of the required reserves each year. We satisfied these requirements as of September 30, 2024. Sources of Liquidity: Warehouse Facilities and Note Payable Warehouse Facilities We use a combination of warehouse facilities and notes payable to provide funding for our operations. We use warehouse facilities to fund our Agency Lending and Interim Loan Program. Our ability to originate Agency mortgage loans and loans held for investments depends upon our ability to secure and maintain these types of financing agreements on acceptable terms. For a detailed description of the terms of each warehouse agreement, refer to Warehouse Facilities in NOTE 6 in the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K, as updated in NOTE 6 in the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Note Payable For a detailed description of the terms of the Credit Agreement and related amendments, refer to Notes Payable Term Loan Note Payable in NOTE 6 in the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note Payable in NOTE 6 in the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. The warehouse notes payable and note payable are subject to various financial covenants. The Company is in compliance with all of these financial covenants as of September 30, 2024.

 Credit Quality and Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligations The following table sets forth certain information useful in evaluating our credit performance. 

September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Key Credit Metrics Risk-sharing servicing portfolio: Fannie Mae Full Risk 57,032,839 53,549,966 Fannie Mae Modified Risk 9,035,373 9,295,368 Freddie Mac Modified Risk 69,400 23,415 Total risk-sharing servicing portfolio 66,137,612 62,868,749 Non-risk-sharing servicing portfolio: Fannie Mae No Risk 5,519 Freddie Mac No Risk 40,020,758 38,632,721 GNMA - HUD No Risk 10,727,323 10,320,520 Brokered 17,156,810 17,091,925 Total non-risk-sharing servicing portfolio 67,904,891 66,050,685 Total loans serviced for others 134,042,503 128,919,434 Interim loans (full risk) servicing portfolio 38,043 40,000 Total servicing portfolio unpaid principal balance 134,080,546 128,959,434 Interim Program JV Managed Loans (1) 424,774 736,320 At risk servicing portfolio (2) 61,237,535 57,857,659 Maximum exposure to at risk portfolio (3) 12,454,158 11,750,068 Defaulted loans (4) 59,645 Defaulted loans as a percentage of the at-risk portfolio 0.10 0.00 Allowance for risk-sharing as a percentage of the at-risk portfolio 0.05 0.05 Allowance for risk-sharing as a percentage of maximum exposure 0.24 0.26 

 (1) As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, this balance consisted entirely of Interim Program JV managed loans. We indirectly share in a portion of the risk of loss associated with Interim Program JV managed loans through our 15 equity ownership in the Interim Program JV. We have no exposure to risk of loss for the loans serviced directly for the Interim Program JV partner. The balance of this line is included as a component of assets under management in the Supplemental Operating Data table above. (2) At-risk servicing portfolio is defined as the balance of Fannie Mae DUS loans subject to the risk-sharing formula described below, as well as a small number of Freddie Mac loans on which we share in the risk of loss. Use of the at-risk portfolio provides for comparability of the full risk-sharing and modified risk-sharing loans because the provision and allowance for risk-sharing obligations are based on the at-risk balances of the associated loans. Accordingly, we have presented the key statistics as a percentage of the at-risk portfolio. 
 For example, a 15 million loan with 50 risk-sharing has the same potential risk exposure as a 7.5 million loan with full DUS risk sharing. Accordingly, if the 15 million loan with 50 risk-sharing were to default, we would view the overall loss as a percentage of the at-risk balance, or 7.5 million, to ensure comparability between all risk-sharing obligations. To date, substantially all of the risk-sharing obligations that we have settled have been from full risk-sharing loans. 
 (3) Represents the maximum loss we would incur under our risk-sharing obligations if all of the loans we service, for which we retain some risk of loss, were to default and all of the collateral underlying these loans was determined to be without value at the time of settlement. The maximum exposure is not representative of the actual loss we would incur. (4) Defaulted loans represent loans in our Fannie Mae at-risk portfolio that are probable of foreclosure or that have foreclosed and for which the Company has recorded a collateral-based reserve (i.e., loans where we have assessed a probable loss). Other loans that are delinquent but not foreclosed or that are not probable of foreclosure are not included here. Additionally, loans that have foreclosed or are probable of foreclosure but are not expected to result in a loss to the Company are not included here. Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing obligations are based on a tiered formula and represent substantially all of our risk-sharing activities. The risk-sharing tiers and the amount of the risk-sharing obligations we absorb under full risk-sharing are provided below. Except as described in 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 the following paragraph, the maximum amount of risk-sharing obligations we absorb at the time of default is generally 20 of the origination unpaid principal balance UPB of the loan. 

Risk-Sharing Losses Percentage Absorbed by Us First 5 of UPB at the time of loss settlement 100 Next 20 of UPB at the time of loss settlement 25 Losses above 25 of UPB at the time of loss settlement 10 Maximum loss 20 of origination UPB Fannie Mae can double or triple our risk-sharing obligation if the loan does not meet specific underwriting criteria or if a loan defaults within 12 months of its sale to Fannie Mae. We may request modified risk-sharing at the time of origination, which reduces our potential risk-sharing obligation from the levels described above. We use several techniques to manage our risk exposure under the Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing program. These techniques include maintaining a strong underwriting and approval process, evaluating and modifying our underwriting criteria given the underlying multifamily housing market fundamentals, limiting our geographic market and borrower exposures, and electing the modified risk-sharing option under the Fannie Mae DUS program. The Segments Capital Markets section of Item 1. Business in our 2023 Form 10-K contains a discussion of the risk-sharing caps we have with Fannie Mae. We regularly monitor the credit quality of all loans for which we have a risk-sharing obligation. Loans with indicators of underperforming credit are placed on a watch list, assigned a numerical risk rating based on our assessment of the relative credit weakness, and subjected to additional evaluation or loss mitigation. Indicators of underperforming credit include poor financial performance, poor physical condition, poor management, and delinquency. A collateral-based reserve is recorded when it is probable that a risk-sharing loan will foreclose or has foreclosed and it is expected to result in a loss for the Company, and a reserve for estimated credit losses and a guaranty obligation are recorded for all other risk-sharing loans. We do not record a collateral-based reserve when it is probable that a risk sharing loan will foreclose or has foreclosed, but it is not expected to result in a loss for the Company. The allowance for risk-sharing obligations for the Company s 60.6 billion at-risk Fannie Mae servicing portfolio as September 30, 2024 was 29.9 million compared to 31.6 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, seven at-risk loans with an aggregate UPB of 59.6 million were in default compared to no at-risk loans as of September 30, 2023. The collateral-based reserve on defaulted loans was 6.5 million and zero as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had a benefit for risk-sharing obligations of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for risk-sharing obligations of 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We had benefits for risk-sharing obligations of 1.3 million and 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are obligated to repurchase loans that are originated for the Agencies programs if certain representations and warranties that we provide in connection with such originations are breached. NOTE 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements has additional details regarding our repurchase obligations. New/Recent Accounting Pronouncements As seen in NOTE 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q, there are no accounting pronouncements that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued that have the potential to materially impact us but have not yet been adopted by us as of September 30, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk For loans held for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD, we are not currently exposed to unhedged interest rate risk during the loan commitment, closing, and delivery processes. The sale or placement of each loan to an investor is negotiated prior to closing on the loan 

 63 

Table of Contents 
 with the borrower, and the sale or placement is typically effectuated within 60 days of closing. The coupon rate for the loan is set at the same time we establish the interest rate with the investor. Some of our assets and liabilities are subject to changes in interest rates. Placement fee revenue from escrow deposits generally track the effective Federal Funds Rate EFFR ). The EFFR was 483 basis points and 533 basis points as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The following table shows the impact on our placement fee revenue due to a 100-basis point increase and decrease in EFFR based on our escrow balances outstanding at each period end. A portion of these changes in earnings as a result of a 100-basis point increase in the EFFR would be delayed by several months due to the negotiated nature of some of our placement arrangements. 

(in thousands) As of September 30, Change in annual placement fee revenue due to: 2024 2023 100 basis point increase in EFFR 30,814 28,164 100 basis point decrease in EFFR (30,814) (28,164) The borrowing cost of our warehouse facilities used to fund loans held for sale is based on SOFR. The base SOFR was 496 basis points and 531 basis points as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The interest income on our loans held for investment is based on SOFR. The SOFR reset date for loans held for investment is the same date as the SOFR reset date for the corresponding warehouse facility. The following table shows the impact on our annual net warehouse interest income due to a 100-basis point increase and decrease in SOFR, based on our warehouse borrowings outstanding at each period end. The changes shown below do not reflect an increase or decrease in the interest rate earned on our loans held for sale. 

(in thousands) As of September 30, Change in annual net warehouse interest income due to: 2024 2023 100 basis point increase in SOFR (10,382) (7,822) 100 basis point decrease in SOFR 10,382 7,822 Our Corporate Debt is based on Adjusted Term SOFR. The following table shows the impact on our annual earnings due to a 100-basis point increase and decrease in SOFR as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on the note payable balance outstanding at each period end. 

(in thousands) As of September 30, Change in annual income from operations due to: 2024 2023 100 basis point increase in SOFR (7,805) (7,885) 100 basis point decrease in SOFR 7,805 7,885 Market Value Risk The fair value of our MSRs is subject to market-value risk. A 100-basis point increase or decrease in the weighted average discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, the fair value of our MSRs by approximately 43.1 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 43.2 million as of September 30, 2023. Our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans include economic deterrents that reduce the risk of loan prepayment prior to the expiration of the prepayment protection period, including prepayment premiums, loan defeasance, or yield maintenance fees. These prepayment protections generally extend the duration of the loan compared to a loan without similar protections. As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, 90 of the loans for which we earn servicing fees are protected from the risk of prepayment through prepayment provisions; given this significant level of prepayment protection, we do not hedge our servicing portfolio for prepayment risk. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective to provide reasonable assurance that 

 64

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, we may be party to various claims and litigation, none of which we believe is material. We cannot predict the outcome of any pending litigation and may be subject to consequences that could include fines, penalties, and other costs, and our reputation and business may be impacted. Our management believes that any liability that could be imposed on us in connection with the disposition of any pending lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors We have included in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our business, future performance, or financial condition (the Risk Factors ). There have been no material changes from the disclosures provided in our 2023 Form 10-K. Investors should consider the Risk Factors prior to making an investment decision with respect to the Company s stock. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Under the Company s 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by stockholders on May 2, 2024 and constitutes an amendment and restatement of the Company s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to the Company s approval, grantees have the option of electing to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations at the time of vesting or exercise by allowing the Company to withhold and purchase the shares of stock otherwise issuable to the grantee. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we purchased thirteen thousand shares to satisfy grantee tax withholding obligations on share-vesting events. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that permits the repurchase of up to 75.0 million of the Company s common stock over a 12-month period beginning on February 23, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under this share repurchase program . The Company had 75.0 million of authorized share repurchase capacity remaining as of September 30, 2024. The following table provides information regarding common stock repurchases for the quarter ended September 30, 2024:
