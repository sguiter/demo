2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN CONDITION (continued) 

equity investment
in Lab Services MSO, offering a broad portfolio of diagnostic tests, including drug testing, toxicology, and a broad array of test services,
from general bloodwork to anatomic pathology, and urine toxicology. In addition, the Company owns commercial real estate that houses
its headquarters in Freehold, New Jersey. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately at September 30, 2024 and had incurred recurring net
losses and generated negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, respectively. 

The
Company has a limited operating history and its continued growth is dependent upon the continuation of generating rental revenue from
its income-producing real estate property in New Jersey and income from equity method investment through its interest in Lab Services
MSO and obtaining additional financing to fund future obligations and pay liabilities arising from normal business operations. In addition,
the current cash balance cannot be projected to cover the operating expenses for the next twelve months from the release date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital, implement
its business plan, and generate significant revenues. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in its efforts to generate
significant revenues, maintain sufficient cash balance or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern. The Company
plans to raise capital through the sale of equity to implement its business plan. However, there is no assurance these plans will be
realized and that any additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if any. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification
of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.

consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

We
are a commercial stage company dedicated to developing and delivering innovative, transformative, precision diagnostics and clinical
laboratory services. We are working toward establishing a leading role in the innovation of diagnostic testing, utilizing proprietary
technology to deliver precise, genetics-driven results. As a first step into the laboratory market, we completed an acquisition of a
40 membership interest in Laboratory Services MSO, LLC Lab Services MSO ), which closed in February 2023. 

We
have the following areas of focus: 

Laboratory
Acquisitions 

We
have embarked on a laboratory rollup strategy focused on forming joint ventures and acquiring laboratories that are accretive to our
commercial strategy. As a first step, in February 2023, we acquired a 40 membership interest in Lab Services MSO. 

Lab Services MSO is focused
 on delivering high quality services related to toxicology and wellness testing and provides a broad portfolio of diagnostic tests,
 including drug testing, toxicology, and a broad array of test services, from general bloodwork to anatomic pathology, and urine toxicology.
 Specific capabilities include STAT blood testing, qualitative drug screening, genetic testing, urinary testing, and sexually transmitted
 disease testing. The panels that Lab Services MSO tests for are thyroid panel, comprehensive metabolic panel, kidney profile, liver
 function tests, and other individual tests. Through Lab Services MSO, we use fast, accurate, and efficient equipment to provide practitioners
 with the tools to quickly determine if a patient is following their designated treatment plan. In most instances, we are able to
 provide a practitioner with qualitative drug class results the same day the sample is received. Lab Services MSO provides a menu
 of extensive chemistry tests that physicians can use to obtain information to better treat their patients and maintain their overall
 wellness. Lab Services MSO has developed a premier reputation for customer service and fast turnaround times. 

Lab Services MSO is also
 focused on commercialization of genetic-based proprietary testing. The first area of focus in this area is confirmatory genetic testing
 during toxicology screening and genetic testing to screen for addictive propensity. Lab Services MSO laboratory plans to focus on
 diagnostic testing utilizing proprietary technology to deliver precise genetic driven results. 

In the third quarter of
 2023, Lab Services MSO acquired Merlin Technologies, Inc., which is a medical equipment retail company. 

32 

Research
and Development 

We
are focused on bringing forward intellectual property through joint patent filings with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT ).
We completed a sponsored research and co-development project with MIT led by Professor Shuguang Zhang as Principal Investigator. Using
the unique QTY code protein design platform, six water-soluble variant cytokine receptors have been successfully designed and tested
to show binding affinity to the respective cytokines. We currently are focused on bringing forward the intellectual property associated
with this program through joint patent submissions. 

Product
Commercialization 

We
have begun the commercialization and development of a versatile breathalyzer system. 

We
were granted exclusive distributorship rights for the KetoAir from Qi Diagnostics for the following territories: North America, South
America, the EU and the UK. For our commercialization strategy, we intend to target the diabetes and obesity markets. We plan to sell
the product through the KetoAir website and social media. We believe the KetoAir device has some competitive advantages to other methods
for measuring ketosis and expect initial sales to occur in the United States. 

The
KetoAir is a handheld device that allows the user to detect acetone levels in exhaled breath. The acetone level is in concentration units
(ppm, part-per-million) such that the user will know his/her real-time ketosis status: inadequate ketosis (0-3.99 ppm), mild ketosis
(4-9.99 ppm), optimal ketosis (10-40 ppm), or alarming level (> 40 ppm). The KetoAir is registered with the United States Food and
Drug Administration as a Class I medical device. The device is also paired with an AI Nutritionist software program (via
Bluetooth connection) which is downloadable from Google Play (for Android mobile phones, approved) and iPhone (the app is currently being
reviewed by Apple iOS AppStore). It helps users monitor and manage their ketogenic diet and related programs. We believe the KetoAir
can be an essential tool to help diabetic patients adhere to their therapeutic programs and optimize their ketogenic dietary management. 

Other
Areas 

In
order to preserve cash and focus on our core laboratory rollup strategy and product commercialization, we have currently suspended all
research and development efforts related to cellular therapy in order to redirect our funding efforts to our core business strategies
outlined above. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company is a commercial stage company dedicated to developing and delivering innovative, transformative, precision diagnostics and clinical
laboratory services. The Company is working to establish a leading role in the innovation of diagnostic testing, utilizing proprietary
technology to deliver precise, genetics-driven results. The Company also provides laboratory services through its 40 equity investment
in Lab Services MSO, offering a broad portfolio of diagnostic tests, including drug testing, toxicology, and a broad array of test services,
from general bloodwork to anatomic pathology, and urine toxicology. 

In
addition, we own commercial real estate that houses our headquarters in Freehold, New Jersey. We also have income from equity method
investment through our 40 interest in Lab Services MSO. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. 

As reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements,
we had working capital deficit of approximately 10,935,000 at September 30, 2024 and had incurred recurring net losses and generated
negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately 5,179,000 and 3,891,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
respectively. 

We
have a limited operating history and our continued growth is dependent upon the continuation of generating rental revenue from our income-producing
real estate property in New Jersey and income from equity method investment through our 40 interest in Lab Services MSO and obtaining
additional financing to fund future obligations and pay liabilities arising from ordinary course business operations. In addition, the
current cash balance cannot be projected to cover our operating expenses for the next twelve months from the release date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital, implement our business plan, and generate sufficient revenues.
There are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to generate sufficient revenues, maintain sufficient cash balance or
report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern. We plan on raising capital through the sale of equity to implement our
business plan. However, there is no assurance these plans will be realized and that any additional financings will be available to us
on satisfactory terms and conditions, or at all. 

33 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification
of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is
at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date
of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more
future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Significant estimates during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 include the useful life of investment in real estate and intangible assets, the assumptions used in assessing impairment
of long-term assets, the valuation of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowances, the valuation of stock-based compensation,
the assumptions used to determine fair value of warrants and embedded conversion features of convertible note payable, and the fair value
of the consideration given and assets acquired in the purchase of our equity interest in Lab Services MSO. 

Investment
in Unconsolidated Company 

We
use the equity method of accounting for our investment in, and earning or loss of, company that we do not control but over which we do
exert significant influence. We apply the equity method by initially recording these investments at cost, as equity method investments,
subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash distributions. 

We
consider whether the fair value of our equity method investment has declined below its carrying value whenever adverse event or change
in circumstance indicates that recorded value may not be recoverable. If we consider any decline to be other than temporary (based on
various factors, including historical financial results and the overall health of the investee), then a write-down would be recorded
to estimated fair value. Impairment of equity method investment amounted to 259,579 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

We
classify distributions received from equity method investments using the cumulative earnings approach. Distributions received are considered
returns on the investment and classified as cash inflows from operating activities. If, however, the investor s cumulative distributions
received, less distributions received in prior periods determined to be returns of investment, exceeds cumulative equity in earnings
recognized, the excess is considered a return of investment and is classified as cash inflows from investing activities.

We
have determined that the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 does not apply to rental contracts, which are within the scope of other revenue recognition accounting standards. 

Rental
income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis under the guidance of ASC 842. Lease payments under tenant leases
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases. The cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized
under the straight-line method and contractual lease payments are included in rent receivable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Income
Taxes 

We
are governed by the income tax laws of China and the United States. Income taxes are accounted for pursuant to ASC 740 Accounting
for Income Taxes, which is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The charge for
taxes is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 

34 

Deferred
tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable
tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are
recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can
be utilized. 

Deferred
tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which
case the deferred tax is changed to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they related to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority and we intend to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Real
Property Rental Revenue 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had real property rental revenue of 345,159, as compared to 331,290 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 13,869, or 4.2 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had real property rental
revenue of 987,634, as compared to 934,360 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 53,274, or 5.7 . The increase
was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of tenants occupying the building in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect that our revenue from real property rent will remain
at its current quarterly level with minimal increase in the near future. 

Real
Property Operating Expenses 

Real
property operating expenses consist of property management fees, property insurance, real estate taxes, depreciation, repairs and maintenance
fees, utilities and other expenses related to our rental properties.

three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 42,555, or 14.8 . The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in repairs and maintenance
fee of approximately 30,000, and a decrease in utilities of approximately 14,000, offset by an increase in other miscellaneous items
of approximately 1,000. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our real property operating expenses amounted to 794,142, as compared to 781,931 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 12,211, or 1.6 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in utilities of
approximately 13,000, offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous items of approximately 1,000. 

Real
Property Operating Income 

Our
real property operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 99,631, representing an increase of 56,424, or 130.6 ,
as compared to 43,207 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in real
property rental revenue and a decrease in real property operating expenses as described above. Our real property operating income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 193,492, representing an increase of 41,063, or 26.9 , as compared to 152,429 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in real property rental revenue as described
above. We expect our real property operating income will remain at its current quarterly level with minimal increase in the near future. 

(Loss)
income from Equity Method Investment Lab Services MSO

of 166,733, and impairment of goodwill acquired from Lab Services MSO acquisition of 259,579, which was primarily attributable to Lab

acquisition of 543,318.

For
 the three months ended September 30, 2024, advertising
 and marketing expenses decreased by 293,016, or 66.9 , as compared to the three months ended
 September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, advertising and marketing
 expenses decreased by 1,382,326, or 84.6 , as compared to the nine months ended September
 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased advertising activities in the three
 and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect that our advertising and marketing expenses
 will decrease in the near future as we conserve cash . 

Professional
 fees primarily consisted of accounting fees, audit fees, legal service fees, consulting fees,
 investor relations service charges, valuation service fees and other fees. For the three
 months ended September 30, 2024, professional fees decreased by 131,812, or 30.3 , as compared
 to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to a decrease
 in legal service fees of approximately 155,000, mainly due to the decreased legal services
 related to our acquisition of Lab Services MSO, offset by an increase in other miscellaneous
 items of approximately 23,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, professional
 fees decreased by 1,469,770, or 55.3 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
 2023, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in consulting fees of approximately
 547,000, mainly due to the decrease in use of consulting service providers related to our
 acquisition of Lab Services MSO, a decrease in audit fees of approximately 126,000, due
 to the decreased audit services related to our acquisition of Lab Services MSO, a decrease
 in accounting fees of approximately 454,000, mainly due to the decreased accounting services
 related to our acquisition of Lab Services MSO, a decrease in legal service fees of approximately
 409,000, mainly due to the decreased legal services related to our acquisition of Lab Services
 MSO, and a decrease in other miscellaneous items of approximately 61,000, offset by an increase
 in valuation fee for our equity method investment on Lab Services MSO of 127,000. We expect
 that our professional fees will likely remain at their current quarterly level with minimal
 increase in the near future. 

36 

For
 the three months ended September 30, 2024, compensation and related benefits decreased by
 126,599, or 26.9 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024, compensation and related benefits decreased by 321,473,
 or 23.4 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily
 attributable to the decreased compensation for two of our named executive officers, David
 Jin and Meng Li. We expect that our compensation and related benefits will remain relatively
 steady, with minimal increase, in the near future . 

For
 the three months ended September 30, 2024, miscellaneous taxes increased by 3,040, or 33.9 ,
 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September
 30, 2024, miscellaneous taxes increased by 217,207, or 440.7 , as compared to the nine months
 ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased Delaware state
 franchise tax. We expect that our miscellaneous taxes will decrease in the near future. 

For
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not incur any research and development
 activity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses
 decreased by 110,160, or 100.0 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not incur any activity with respect to
 research and development projects as we redirected our funding efforts to our core business
 strategies discussed above. 

For
 the three months ended September 30, 2024, Directors and Officers Liability Insurance
 premium decreased by 34,067, or 46.8 , as compared to the three months ended September 30,
 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Directors and Officers Liability
 Insurance premium decreased by 103,057, or 36.7 , as compared to the nine months ended September
 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to our switching to a different insurance provider,
 resulting in a lower premium. 

For the
 three months ended September 30, 2024, travel and entertainment expense decreased by 27,842,
 or 45.2 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended
 September 30, 2024, travel and entertainment expense decreased by 101,385, or 56.5 , as
 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to decreased
 business travel activities in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
 to the corresponding periods in 2023. 

For
 the three months ended September 30, 2024, rent and
 related utilities expenses increased by 426, or 2.8 , as compared to the three months ended

 expenses decreased by 1,829, or 3.8 , as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
 2023. The decrease was attributable to decreased rental rate in the nine months ended September
 30, 2024. 

Other
 general and administrative expenses mainly consisted
 of NASDAQ listing fee, office supplies, and other miscellaneous items. For the three months
 ended September 30, 2024, other general and administrative expenses decreased by 7,290,
 or 19.6 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to our efforts at
 stricter controls on corporate expenditure. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
 other general and administrative expenses decreased by 71,426, or 48.6 , as compared to
 the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was mainly attributable to a decrease in
 fees paid to government agencies and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of approximately
 31,000, a decrease in office supplies of approximately 16,000, and a decrease in other
 miscellaneous items of approximately 24,000 due to our efforts at stricter controls on corporate
 expenditure.

30, 2024, as compared to 343,939 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 65,300, or 19.0 , which was primarily
attributable to an increase in third party interest expense of approximately 108,000, mainly driven by the increase in amortization of
debt discount and debt issuance costs of approximately 80,000 and the increased interest expense of approximately 28,000 from third
party debts, a decrease in other income of approximately 39,000, offset by an increase in gain from change in fair value of derivative
liability of approximately 82,000. 

37 

Other expense, net, totaled 1,561,353 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 1,189,045 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 372,308, or 31.3 , which was primarily

periods. 

Net
Loss 

As a result of the factors described

September 30, 2023, an increase of 194,125, or 13.1 . 

As a result of the factors described
above, our net loss was 5,178,739 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7,151,876 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 1,973,137, or 27.6 . 

Net
Loss Attributable to Avalon GloboCare Corp. Common Shareholders 

The net
loss attributable to our common shareholders was 1,679,200, or 1.82 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 1,485,075, or 2.06 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase
of 194,125, or 13.1 . 

The net loss attributable to
our common shareholders was 5,178,739, or 6.45 per share (basic and diluted), for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 7,151,876, or 10.34 per share (basic and diluted), for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,973,137, or 27.6 . 

Foreign
Currency Translation Adjustment 

Our
reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our parent company, AHS, Avalon RT 9, and Avalon Lab is the U.S. dollar
and the functional currency of Avalon Shanghai is the Chinese Renminbi RMB ). The financial statements of our subsidiary
whose functional currency is the RMB are translated to U.S. dollars using period end rate of exchange for assets and liabilities, average
rate of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses and cash flows, and at historical exchange rate for equity. Net gains and losses resulting
from foreign exchange transactions are included in the results of operations. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are
a non-cash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation gain of 3,043 and a foreign currency translation loss of 8,685 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are a non-cash
adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation gain of 2,829 and a foreign currency translation loss of 16,026 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This non-cash gain/loss had the effect of decreasing/increasing our reported
comprehensive loss in each respective period. 

Comprehensive
Loss 

As a result of our foreign currency translation adjustment, we had
comprehensive loss of 1,676,157 and 1,493,760 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As a result of our foreign currency translation adjustment, we had
comprehensive loss of 5,175,910 and 7,167,902 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

38 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have a limited operating history and our continued growth is dependent upon the continuation of generating rental revenue from our income-producing
real estate property in New Jersey and income from equity method investment through our equity interest in Lab Services MSO, as well
as obtaining additional financing to fund future obligations and pay liabilities arising from ordinary course business operations. In
addition, the current cash balance cannot be projected to cover our operating expenses for the next twelve months from the release date
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital, implement our business plan, and generate sufficient
revenues. There are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to generate sufficient revenues, maintain sufficient cash
balance or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern. As described below, we have raised additional capital through
the sale of equity and debt and we plan to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of equity or debt to implement our
business plan. However, there is no assurance these plans will be realized and that any additional financings will be available to us
on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations as they come due
and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a cash balance of approximately 1,024,000
and 285,000, respectively. These funds are kept in financial institutions located as follows:

Our working capital deficit increased by 5,023,533 to 10,935,352
at September 30, 2024 from 5,911,819 at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital deficit was primarily attributable to a decrease
in rent receivable of approximately 120,000 driven by collection efforts in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in
accrued liabilities and other payables of 288,000 mainly due to the increase in accrued Delaware state franchise tax in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables related parties of approximately 507,000 mainly
due to our equity method investment payable paid by a related party on our behalf, a significant increase in advance from pending sale
of noncontrolling interest related party of approximately 2,022,000 resulting from advance received in connection with the membership
interest purchase agreement entered into in November 2023 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in note payable, net,
of approximately 4,719,000, which was attributable to the reclassification of note payable from non-current to current, and an increase
in convertible note payable, net, of approximately 211,000, offset by an increase in cash of approximately 739,000, a decrease in accrued
professional fees of approximately 1,191,000 resulting from payments made to our professional service providers in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, a decrease in accrued payroll liability and compensation of approximately 201,000, and a decrease in equity method
investment payable of approximately 667,000 resulting from payment of 100,000 made to investee and payment of approximately 567,000
made by a related party on our behalf in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Because
the exchange rate conversion is different for the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows, the changes in assets and liabilities reflected on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows are not necessarily
identical with the comparable changes reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Cash
Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

Net cash flow used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,890,993, which primarily reflected our consolidated net loss of approximately
 5,179,000, and the non-cash items adjustment, primarily consisting of change in fair market value of derivative liability of approximately
 381,000, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of a decrease in accrued liabilities and other payables
of approximately 1,176,000 resulting from payments made to our vendors in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a decrease
in rent receivable of approximately 132,000 driven by our collection efforts, and the non-cash items adjustment, primarily consisting
of depreciation of approximately 133,000, stock-based compensation and service expense of approximately 255,000, loss from equity method
investment of approximately 670,000 which was mainly attributable to the amortization of
identifiable intangible assets acquired from Lab Services MSO acquisition of approximately 500,000 and the impairment of goodwill acquired
from Lab Services MSO acquisition of approximately 260,000, resulting from Lab Services MSO s lower revenues and net incomes
than anticipated and the decline in our stock price and market capitalization, distribution of earnings
from equity method investment of approximately 612,000, and amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount of approximately 1,115,000.

cash flow used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 5,708,402, which primarily reflected our consolidated
net loss of approximately 7,152,000, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily consisting of a decrease in accrued
liabilities and other payables of approximately 140,000 due to payments made to vendors in the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
and the non-cash items adjustment, primarily consisting of income from equity method investment of approximately 351,000 resulting from
our purchase of a 40 equity interest in Lab Services MSO in February 2023, and change in fair market value of derivative liability of
approximately 129,000, offset by depreciation of approximately 167,000, stock-based compensation and service expense of approximately
 1,056,000, impairment of equity method investment of approximately 464,000, and amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount
of approximately 291,000. 

We
expect our cash used in operating activities to increase in the next 12 months due to the following: 

the
 development and commercialization of new products; and 

an
 increase in public relations and/or sales promotions for existing and/or new brands as we
 expand within existing markets or enter new markets. 

Net
cash flow used in investing activities was 100,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 22,171 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 100,000 for the acquisition of a 40 interest
in Lab Services MSO. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made payment for purchase of property and equipment of approximately
 22,000. 

Net
cash flow provided by financing activities was 4,726,942 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4,091,323 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds from the issuance
of convertible debts and warrants of approximately 3,085,000 (net of original issue discount of approximately 177,000 and cash paid
for convertible note issuance costs of approximately 283,000), an advance from the pending sale of a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary
of approximately 2,022,000, and net proceeds from equity offering of approximately 2,719,000 (net of cash paid for commission and other
offering costs of approximately 138,000), offset by repayments made for convertible debt of 3,100,000. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we received proceeds from related party borrowings of 850,000, and net proceeds from issuance of convertible debt
and warrants of approximately 1,690,000 (net of original issue discount of 100,000 and cash paid for convertible note issuance costs
of approximately 211,000), and net proceeds from issuance of balloon promissory note of approximately 936,000 (net of cash paid for
promissory note issuance costs of approximately 64,000), and net proceeds from equity offering of approximately 616,000 (net of cash
paid for commission and other offering costs of approximately 19,000). 

The
following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to long term: 

an increase in working
 capital requirements to finance our current business; 

the use of capital for
 acquisitions and the development of business opportunities; and 

the cost of being a public
 company.

August
2019 Credit Facility 

In
the third quarter of 2019, we entered into a 20 million credit facility (the Line of Credit provided by our Chairman
of the Board and a significant (and our largest) stockholder, Wenzhao Lu. The Line of Credit bears interest at a rate of 5 and provides
for maturity on drawn loans 36 months after funding. As of September 30, 2024, we had used approximately 6.8 million of the Line of
Credit and had approximately 13.2 million remaining available under the Line of Credit. 

ATM 

In
June 2023, we entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC Roth under which we may offer and sell from time to time shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 3.5 million.
From July 1, 2023 to August 16, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 312,285 shares of our common stock at an average price of 11.19 per share
to investors pursuant to the Sales Agreement, and received net cash proceeds of 3,388,251, net of cash paid for Roth s commissions
and other fees of 104,992. 

March
2024 Convertible Note Financing 

In
March 2024, we entered into a security purchase agreement with a lender (the March 2024 Lender and closed on the issuance
of a 13.0 senior secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of 700,000 (the March 2024 Convertible Note ),
as well as the issuance of 7,000 shares of common stock as a commitment fee and warrants for the purchase of up to 16,827 shares of our
common stock. We and our subsidiaries also entered into security agreements in connection with issuance of the March 2024 Convertible
Note, creating a security interest in certain property of the Company and its subsidiaries to secure the prompt payment, performance
and discharge in full of all of our obligations under the March 2024 Convertible Note. 

June
2024 Convertible Note Financing 

In
June 2024, we entered into a security purchase agreement with a lender (the June 2024 Lender and closed on the issuance
of a 13.0 senior secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of 2,845,000 (the June 2024 Convertible Note ),
as well as the issuance of 26,800 shares of common stock as a commitment fee and warrants for the purchase of up to 146,667 shares of
our common stock. We and our subsidiaries also entered into security agreements in connection with issuance of the June 2024 Convertible
Note, creating a security interest in certain property of the Company and its subsidiaries to secure the prompt payment, performance
and discharge in full of all of our obligations under the June 2024 Convertible Note. 

We
estimate that, based on current plans and assumptions, our available cash will be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under
our present operating expectations through cash flow provided by operations, and cash available under the Line of Credit and sales of
equity. Other than funds received as described above and cash resources generated from our operations, we presently have no other significant
alternative source of working capital. We have used these funds to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations and grow our company.
We will need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operations and to provide working capital for our ongoing operations
and obligations. Therefore, our future operation is dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions may
include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading price
of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance
of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and
expenses or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional
equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences
or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital may restrict our ability
to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will
be required to cease our operations. To date, we have not considered this alternative, nor do we view it as a likely occurrence. 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

We
ceased all operations in China in 2022, with the exception of a small administrative office. We did not during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and do not expect in the foreseeable future, to generate any additional revenue from PRC operations. Thus, exchange
rate fluctuations between the RMB and the U.S. dollar do not have a material effect on us. For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we had an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of approximately 3,000 and an unrealized foreign currency translation
loss of approximately 9,000, respectively, because of changes in the exchange rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we had an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of approximately 3,000 and an unrealized foreign currency translation loss
of approximately 16,000, respectively, because of changes in the exchange rate. 

Inflation 

The
effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results was not significant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As
a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by
this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
(the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent
limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

In
connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Based
on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due
to the material weaknesses that were previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed
with the SEC on April 15, 2024, that have not yet been remediated. Management s plan to remediate these material weaknesses is
described in detail in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

42 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party
to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, we believe would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed
in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the
SEC on April 15, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that
we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued a total of 45,153 shares of its common stock for services rendered and to

2024 and reduced accrued liabilities of 60,000 and recorded prepaid expense of 28,879 as of September 30, 2024 which will be amortized
over the rest of corresponding service periods. 

The

reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, as transactions by an issuer not involving
a public offering. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions acquired the securities for investment only and not with
a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were affixed to the securities issued in these
transactions. Each of the recipients of securities in these transactions was an accredited or sophisticated person and had adequate access,
