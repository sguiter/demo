 million as of September 30, 2024, having incurred a net loss of million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

On October 7, 2024, the Company
satisfied all of its secured debt and million of unsecured debt by assigning ownership of its subsidiary, Craft C+P, to the creditors
of that debt, who additionally surrendered to the Company shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The transaction substantially reduced
the Company s debt obligations. On the same day, Beeline merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Beeline used 
million in operating activities during 2023 and million in operating activities during the first six months of 2024, funds that
it obtained from a variety of debt and equity financing transactions. 

The Company s ability, therefore,
to meet its ongoing operating cash needs over the next 12 months will depend in part on generating positive operating cash flow through
increased sales. However, the Company will continue to depend, for the foreseeable future, on debt and/or equity financing. If the Company
is unable to obtain additional financing, or additional financing is not available on acceptable terms, the Company may seek to sell assets,
reduce operating expenses, reduce or eliminate marketing initiatives, and take other measures that could impair its ability to be successful. 

Although
the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared under the assumption that it would
continue operations as a going concern, the report of its independent registered public accounting firm that accompanied the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contained a going concern explanatory paragraph in which such firm expressed substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, based on the financial statements at that time. If the Company
cannot continue as a going concern, its stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in it.

The
hierarchy of fair value valuation techniques under GAAP provides for three levels: Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair
value, whereas Level 3, if applicable, generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing assets
and liabilities under GAAP s fair value measurement requirements are as follows: 

Level 1: 
 Fair value of the asset
 or liability is determined using cash or unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: 
 Fair value of the asset
 or liability is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability, either
 directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted
 prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3: 
 Fair value of the asset
 or liability is determined using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and reflect management s
 own assumptions regarding the applicable asset or liability. 

None
of the Company s assets or liabilities were measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. However, GAAP
requires the disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments
consist principally of trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes payable, and the secured credit facilities. The
estimated fair value of trade receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying value due to the short
period of time to their maturities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the principal amounts of the Company s notes
approximated fair value. 

Items
Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Certain
assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition are valued at fair value at the date of acquisition due to having indefinite
lives. The Company, on an annual basis, tests the indefinite life assets for impairment. If an indefinite life asset is found to be impaired,
then the Company will estimate its useful life and amortize the asset over the remainder of its useful life. 

. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using
the straight-line method over the life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. The cost and related accumulated
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
is reported as current period income or expense. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

(spirits program) or (co-packing program) of the amount due. When the customer remits payment, the Company receives the remaining
balance. For the spirits program, interest is charged on the advanced 75 payment at a rate of 2.4 for the first 30 days plus 1.44 
for each additional ten-day period. For the co-packing program, interest was charged against the greater of million or the total
funds advanced at a rate of plus the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal. Under the terms of both agreements, the factoring
provider had full recourse against the Company should the customer fail to pay the invoice. In accordance with ASC Topic 860 
 Transfers and Servicing , the Company has concluded that these agreements have met all three conditions identified in ASC Topic
860-10-40-5 (a) (c) and have accounted for this activity as a sale. Given the quality of the factored accounts, the Company had
not recognized a recourse obligation. In certain limited instances, the Company may provide collection services on the factored accounts
but did not receive any fees for acting as the collection agent, and as such, the Company had not recognized a service obligation asset
or liability. The Company factored million of invoices and incurred in fees associated with the factoring programs during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

On
September 4, 2024, the Company and its subsidiary, Craft C+P, entered into the Debt Agreement with The B.A.D. Company, LLC (the SPV ),
Aegis Security Insurance Company Aegis ), Bigger Capital Fund, LP Bigger ), District 2 Capital Fund, LP District
2 ), LDI Investments, LLC LDI ), William Esping Esping ), WPE Kids Partners WPE and
Robert Grammen Grammen ), collectively, the Investors . The SPV is a special purpose vehicle whose equity
is shared by Bigger and District 2 and by Aegis and LDI. 

On
October 7, 2024, a closing will be held pursuant to the terms of the Debt Agreement. Aegis, Bigger, District 2 and LDI will transfer
to the Company shares of Series C Preferred Stock and shares of the Company s common stock. The Investors will also
release the Company from liability for million of senior secured debt and million of unsecured debt. In consideration of their
surrender of stock and release of debt, the Company will cause Craft C+P to be merged into a limited liability company owned by the Investors.
Given that the effect of the Debt Agreement meets all the initial criteria for classification of held for sale, the assets, liabilities,
and operating results of Craft C+P have been classified as held for sale during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The consolidated financial statements for the prior periods have been adjusted to

To
determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the calculation takes into consideration the effect
of the following: 

Exercise
 price of the option 

Fair
 value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant 

Expected
 term of the option 

Expected
 volatility over the expected term of the option 

Risk-free
 interest rate for the expected term of the option 

The
calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment. The expected term of the options is calculated using
the simplified method described in GAAP. The simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the
vesting period. Estimated volatility is derived from volatility calculated using historical closing prices of common shares of similar
entities whose share prices are publicly available for the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the options.

Company did not issue any additional options during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Overview 

Eastside
Distilling, Inc. (the Company, Eastside Distilling, we, us, or our, 
below) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada in 2004 under the name of Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. In December 2014, we changed our corporate
name to Eastside Distilling, Inc. to reflect our acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC. On September 4, 2024, we entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement with East Acquisition Sub Inc. Merger Sub and Beeline Financial Holdings, Inc. Beeline ). The Merger closed on October 7, 2024, at which time Beeline became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. Beeline is a mortgage technology company that operates an end-to-end, all-digital, AI-enhanced platform for
homeowners and property investors. 

On
September 4, 2024, we and our subsidiary, Craft Canning + Printing Craft C+P ), entered into a Debt Exchange Agreement
(the Debt Agreement ), which closed on October 7, 2024, resulting in 720 barrels of spirits being assigned by the Company
to Craft C+P, and Craft C+P being merged into a limited liability company owned by certain creditors of the Company. Given that the effect
of the Debt Agreement meets all the initial criteria of ASC Topic 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued
Operations for the classification of held for sale, the assets, liabilities, and operating results of Craft C+P have been classified
as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023. The consolidated financial statements for the prior periods have been adjusted to reflect comparable information. 

26 

Subsequent
to the execution of the Debt Agreement, we organized a subsidiary named Bridgetown Spirits Corp. Bridgetown ), which was incorporated on October 3, 2024,
and assigned to Bridgetown the Company s business of manufacturing and marketing spirits. Bridgetown manufactures, acquires, blends,
bottles, imports, markets and sells a wide variety of alcoholic beverages under recognized brands. Bridgetown s brands span several
alcoholic beverage categories, including whiskey, vodka, rum, and tequila. Bridgetown sells products on a wholesale basis to distributors
in open states and through brokers in control states. 

Mission
and Strategy 

Our
mission is to offer great products and services in the craft beverage space. Our spirits brands span several alcoholic beverage categories,
including whiskey, vodka, rum and tequila. We sell our products on a wholesale basis to distributors through open states, and brokers
in control states. 

Our
strategy is to expand Bridgetown in our regional market where our brand equity and concentration of investment will have the greatest
return. Our spirits portfolio is to be positioned as a leading regional craft spirits provider that develops brands, expands geographic
presence growing revenue and cash flow. 

Segments 

As
of September 30, 2024, our internal management financial reporting consisted of Bridgetown and corporate. The Bridgetown brands span
several alcoholic beverage categories, including whiskey, vodka, rum, and tequila and are sold on a wholesale basis to distributors in
open states, and to brokers in control states. Our principal area of operation is in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Corporate consists of
key executive and accounting personnel and corporate expenses such as public company and board costs, as well as interest on debt. 

Bridgetown
Spirits Corp. 

Since
2014, we have developed or acquired award-winning spirits while evolving to meet the growing demand for quality products and services
associated within the burgeoning craft and premium beverage trade. Our portfolio includes originals like the Quercus garryana 
barrel-finished Burnside Whiskey family, Portland Potato Vodka, Hue-Hue Coffee Rum, and Azu ia Tequilas. 

Burnside
 Whiskey Family Our Burnside Whiskey Family celebrates the unique attributes of the native Oregon Oak tree Quercus
 garryana ). The unique complexity of each distinct whiskey comes from blending Oregon Oak barrels of differing sizes, char levels,
 and ages. 

Portland
 Potato Vodka Our award-winning premium craft vodka is distilled four times to ensure a smooth finish. While most vodka
 is made from grain, we source award winning premium potato ethanol and blend it with pristine water sourced from Oregon. 

Hue-Hue
 (pronounced way-way Coffee Rum Premium silver rum is blended with concentrated cold-brewed coffee and
 a small amount of Demerara sugar. We source fair-trade, single-origin Arabica coffee beans from the Finca El Paternal Estate in Huehuetenango,
 Guatemala that are lightly roasted for us by Portland Coffee Roasters. 

Azu ia
 Tequilas Smooth, clean, additive-free tequilas crafted by Rancho Miravalle, a second generation, family-owned-and-operated
 estate, bursting with authentic flavor from the local terroir of Tequila Valley, Mexico. 100 pure Weber Blue Agave is harvested
 by hand, roasted in traditional clay hornos, and finished with a natural, open-air fermentation process. It is bottled on-site in
 small batches using a consistent process to deliver consistent field-to-bottle quality and exclusively exported by Agaveros Unidos
 de Amatit n. 

Eastside
 Brands Craft inspired high-quality limited-edition products, which focus on innovation, craftsmanship and curiosity,
 and creativity. 

27 

Recent
Developments 

Bridgetown
reduced its sale of bulk barrels in the third quarter of 2024 and saw total volume decline by 12 in the quarter. The majority of the
decline was driven by the reduction in distribution of Azu ia tequila as we realigned the brand with new distribution partners.
Spirits case shipments in the quarter were down 12 with Portland Potato Vodka down 6 and Burnside down 17 .

Corporate
consists of key executive and accounting personnel and corporate expenses such as public company and board costs, as well as interest
on debt. 

Sales 

Sales
were 2.1 million and 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.8 million for both the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold 65 and 250 barrels, respectively, for gross proceeds of 0.1 million and 0.6
million, respectively. Spirits sales decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower sales of tequila and bourbon.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, spirits sold 17,431 cases compared to 19,485 cases in the prior year. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 5,868 cases compared to 6,849 cases in the prior year and 65 barrels for gross proceeds
of 0.1 million. We rationalize our barrel inventory by repositioning our bulk spirits portfolio for anticipated future products and
forecasted demand. 

Customer
programs and excise taxes 

Customer
programs and excise taxes were 0.1 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and minimal for both the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales consists of all direct costs for raw materials, labor, overhead, packaging, and in-bound freight charges. Cost of sales were
 1.5 million and 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.6 million for both the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cost of sales decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower bulk spirits
and distributor sales, in addition to lower tequila pricing and raw material savings. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of products sold and services rendered from net sales. Gross profit was 0.5 million and
 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.2 million for both the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. 

Gross
margin is gross profit stated as a percentage of net sales. Our gross margin was 25 and 34 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively, 26 and 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Gross
profit and gross margin decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to bulk spirit sales during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to bulk spirits sales
and continued cost savings initiatives that began in 2023 and continued into 2024. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses were 0.7 million and 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.2
million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to reduced headcount as part of sprits
restructuring. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were 1.1 million and 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and
 0.4 million and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to a reversal of 0.1 million related
to compensation expense in the third quarter of 2023. 

29 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense was 1.0 million and 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.4 million and 0.2
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the Debt Satisfaction Agreement on September 29,
2023. 

Loss
on Debt to Equity Conversion 

On
September 29, 2023, we issued to the SPV 296,722 shares of common stock and 200,000 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock. In exchange
for that equity, our debts to the members of the SPV were reduced by a total of 6.5 million and we recognized a loss on the debt to
equity conversion was 1.3 million for both the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Income (Loss) 

Net
loss was 2.3 million and 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.8 million and 1.8
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to the Debt Satisfaction Agreement. 

Preferred
Stock Dividends 

Preferred
stock dividends were 0.1 million and 37,500 and for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing
the Series B preferred stock dividend of 6 per annum. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Through
September 30, 2024, our primary capital requirements have been for cash used in operating activities and for the repayment of debt.
Funds for our cash and liquidity needs have historically not been generated from operations but rather from short-term credit in the
form of extended payment terms from suppliers as well as proceeds from loans and the sale of convertible debt and equity. We have
been dependent on raising capital from debt and equity financing to meet our operating needs. 

As a result of these historical practices, we
had an accumulated deficit of 87.0 million as of September 30, 2024, having incurred a net loss of 4.1 million during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.3 million of cash on hand with negative working capital of 12.6 million. 

On October 7, 2024 we satisfied
all secured debt and 2.5 million of unsecured debt by assigning ownership of Craft C+P to the creditors of that debt, who additionally
surrendered to us 44,279 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The transaction substantially reduced our debt obligations. On the same day,
however, Beeline merged into our wholly-owned subsidiary. Beeline used 8.6 million of cash in operating activities during 2023 and 10.1
million of cash in operating activities during the first six months of 2024, funds that it obtained from a variety of debt and equity
financing transactions. 

Our ability,
therefore, to meet our ongoing operating cash needs over the next 12 months will depend, in part, on the success of Beeline in
expanding sales and achieving cash-positive operations. In larger part, however, our ability to meet near-term operating cash needs
will depend on our success in securing debt and/or equity financing as needed. On November 14, 2024, we closed on a sale of 1.9
million in secured debt, from which we gained 1.6 million in net cash before payment of the transaction costs. These funds should
be adequate to fund our cash flow requirement into early 2025. The availability of additional financing will be largely dependent on
the operating success of Beeline, including improved gross margins as well as operational improvements, which will be necessary to
attract investors. 

Our
cash flow results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (which do not include any cash flows attributable to
Beeline) were as follows:

Operating
Activities 

Total
cash used in operating activities was 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.7 million used during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The use of cash was similar, even as we lost 1.3 million more during
the 2023 period, primarily because the 2023 loss included a 1.3 million loss on the debt to equity conversion that occurred during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Investing
Activities 

Total
cash provided by investing activities was 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing net proceeds
from the sale by Craft C+P of fixed assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was
 0.1 million representing net purchases of fixed assets. 

Financing
Activities 

Total
cash provided by financing activities was 1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of 1.1 million from the sale of secured notes in May 2024
and 0.4 million from an at-the-market sale of common stock in September 2024. Total cash provided by financing activities was 1.4 million during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of stock. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts
and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period
in which they become known. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially
accurate. 

In
connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was one accounting estimate
we made that was subject to a high degree of uncertainty and was critical to our results, as follows: 

Intangible
Assets 

On
September 12, 2019, we purchased the Azu ia brand, the direct sales team, existing product inventory, supply chain relationships
and contractual agreements from Intersect Beverage, LLC, an importer and distributor of tequila and related products. The Azu ia
brand has been determined to have an indefinite life and will not be amortized. We do, however, on an annual basis, test the indefinite
life assets for impairment. If the carrying value of the indefinite life assets are found to be impaired, then we will record an impairment
loss and reduce the carrying value of the asset s estimate the useful life of the brand and amortize the asset over the remainder
of its useful life. 

We
estimate the brand s fair value using market information to estimate future cash flows and will impair it when its carrying amount
exceeds its estimated fair value, in which case we will write it down to its estimated fair value. We consider market values for similar
assets when available. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value, including making assumptions about future
cash flows, net sales and discount rates. 

We
have the option, before quantifying the fair value, to evaluate qualitative factors to assess whether it is more likely than not that
our brand is impaired. If we determine that is not the case, then we are not required to quantify the fair value. That assessment also
takes considerable management judgment. 

As
of December 31, 2023, as a result of the review described above, we found the Azu ia brand to be impaired and reduced its carrying
cost by 0.4 million.

As
a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required
by this item. 

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange
Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurances that the information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

We
conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act)), under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

There
were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

March 1, 2023, Sandstrom Partners, Inc. filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Multnomah alleging
the Company failed to pay for its services pursuant to an agreement entered into on October 16, 2019. The complaint sought damages of
 245,000, plus a judicial declaration, due to the Company s failure to pay for the services. The Company believes that it paid
for services rendered. On October 28, 2024, the Company signed a term sheet to settle the case for an immaterial amount. 

On
December 15, 2020, Grover Wickersham filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District Court of Oregon against the
Company. Mr. Wickersham, the former CEO and Chairman of the Board of the Company, has asserted causes of action for fraud in the inducement,
breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, interference with economic advantage,
elder financial abuse, and dissemination of false and misleading proxy materials. During June 2024, this case was settled for an immaterial
amount. 

We
are not currently subject to any other material legal proceedings; however, we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from
time to time in the ordinary course of our business, or legal proceedings we considered immaterial may in the future become material.
Regardless of the outcome, litigation can, among other things, be time consuming and expensive to resolve, and divert management resources. 

ITEM
1A RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, except for the following additions: 

If
the Company is unable to remedy its shareholder equity deficiency, its common stock may be removed from Nasdaq. 

On
April 8, 2024, the Staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market notified the Company that it had fallen
out of compliance with the requirements for continued listing of the Company s common stock on Nasdaq. Specifically, Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(b)(1) requires that the stockholders equity of a listed company must exceed 2.5 million. On June 3, 2024 the Staff
extended to October 7, 2024 the date by which the Company could regain compliance with the Equity Rule. Based upon the closing of Merger
and the Debt Agreement on October 7, 2024, the Company has regained compliance with the Equity Rule. Nasdaq has advised the Company,
however, that it will continue to monitor the Company s ongoing compliance with the Equity Rule and, if at the time when the Company
files its next periodic report with the SEC i.e. its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024 - the Company
does not evidence compliance with the Equity Rule, the Company s common stock may be subject to delisting from Nasdaq.
