 SECTION 12. QUALIFYING AWARDS 
 
 12.1 Grant of Qualifying Awards . 
 (a) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant a Qualifying Award under the Plan to any key employee. The provisions of this Section 12, as well as all other applicable provisions of the Plan not inconsistent with this Section 12, shall apply to all Qualifying Awards granted under the Plan, and any ambiguities in construction shall be interpreted to effectuate that intent. Qualifying Awards shall be of the type set forth in Section 12.1(b). However, nothing in the Plan shall be construed to require the Committee to grant any Qualifying Award and the Committee may, subject to the terms of the Plan, amend or take any other action with respect to previously granted Qualifying Awards in a way that disqualifies them as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. 
 (b) Qualifying Awards may be issued as Performance Grants granted under Section 11 or as any other Award whose vesting or payment is conditioned upon the achievement of the performance objectives described in Section 12.2, and Qualifying Awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions otherwise applicable to such Award, including, for the avoidance of doubt, a minimum vesting or performance period of one year, except as otherwise permitted by Section 6.5. 
 12.2 Performance Objectives . Amounts earned under Qualifying Awards shall be based upon the attainment of performance objectives established by the Committee in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code.

 Performance may be measured on an individual, corporate group, business unit, subsidiary, division, department, region, function or consolidated basis and may be measured absolutely or relatively to the Company s peers. In establishing performance objectives, the Committee may account for 
 (i) the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, extraordinary dividends, stock split-ups, stock dividends or distributions, recapitalizations, warrants or rights issuances or combinations, exchanges or reclassifications with respect to any outstanding class or series of the Company s common stock 
 (ii) a corporate transaction, such as any merger of the Company with another corporation any consolidation of the Company and another corporation into another corporation any separation of the Company or its business units (including a spin-off or other distribution of stock or property by the Company) 
 (iii) any reorganization of the Company (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Section 368 of the Code), or any partial or complete liquidation by the Company, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company 
 (iv) the impact of changes in tax rates or currency fluctuations or changes in accounting standards or treatments 
 (v) advertising or promotional spending or capital expenditures outside of annual business plans

 12.3 Committee Negative Discretion . The Committee shall have the discretion, by Participant and by Qualifying Award, to reduce (but not to increase) some or all of the amount that would otherwise be payable under a Qualifying Award by reason of the satisfaction of the performance objectives set forth in such Qualifying Award. In making any such determination, the Committee is authorized in its discretion to 
 11 

take into account any such factor or factors it determines are appropriate, including but not limited to Company, business unit and individual performance. 
 
 SECTION 13. PAYMENT OF AWARDS 
 
 13.1 Method of Payment . The Committee may, in its discretion, settle any Award through the payment of cash, the delivery of shares of Common Stock or other property, or a combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine or as specified by the Plan or an Award Agreement. Any Award settlement, including payment deferrals, may be subject to conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. 
 13.2 Deferred Compensation . The Committee may, in its discretion, permit the deferral of payment of an employee s cash bonus, other cash compensation or an Award to a Participant under the Plan in the form of either shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents (with each Common Stock equivalent corresponding to a share of Common Stock), under such terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe in the Award Agreement relating thereto or a separate election form made available to such Participant, including the terms of any deferred compensation plan under which such Common Stock equivalents may be granted. In addition, the Committee may, in any year, provide for an additional matching deferral to be credited to an employee s account under such deferred compensation plans. The Committee may also permit hypothetical account balances of other cash or mutual fund equivalents maintained pursuant to such deferred compensation plans to be converted, at the discretion of the Participant, into the form of Common Stock equivalents, or to permit Common Stock equivalents to be converted into account balances of such other cash or mutual fund equivalents, upon the terms set forth in such plans as well as such other terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its discretion, determine. The Committee may, in its discretion, determine whether any deferral in the form of Common Stock equivalents, including deferrals under the terms of any deferred compensation plans of the Company, shall be paid on distribution in the form of cash or in shares of Common Stock. To the extent Section 409A is applicable, all actions pursuant to this Section 13.2 must satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, including but not limited to the following 
 (a) a Participant s election to defer must be filed at such time as designated by the Committee, but in no event later than the December 31 preceding the first day of the calendar year in which the services are performed which relate to the compensation or Award being deferred. An election may not be revoked or modified after such December 31. However, notwithstanding the previous two sentences, if the compensation or Award is subject to a forfeiture condition requiring the Participant s continued services for a period of at least 12 months from the date the Participant obtains the legally binding right to the compensation or Award, the Committee may permit a Participant to file an election on or before the 30th day after the Participant obtains the legally binding right to the compensation or Award, provided that the election is filed at least 12 months in advance of the earliest date at which the forfeiture condition could lapse 
 (b) a Participant s election to defer must include the time and form of payment, within the parameters made available by the Committee, and such timing of payment must comply with Section 409A and 
 (c) if payment is triggered due to the Participant s termination of employment or separation from service, such termination or separation must be a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, and, for purposes of any such provision of the Plan or an election, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean such a separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred for this purpose shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations, unless the Committee has established other rules in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. If payment is made due to a Participant s separation from service, and if at the time of the Participant s separation from service, the Participant is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A(2)(B)), then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Participant becomes entitled to under this provision on account of such separation from service would be considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, such payment or benefit shall be paid or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after such separation from service, and (ii) the date of the 
 12 

Participant s death (the Delay Period ). All payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this provision shall be paid in a lump sum upon expiration of the Delay Period. 
 
 SECTION 14. DILUTION AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS 
 
 14.1 Adjustment for Corporate Transaction or Change in Corporate Capitalization . In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company by reason of any corporate transaction or change in corporate capitalization such as a stock split, stock dividend, split-up, split-off, spin-off, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, rights offering, reorganization, combination, consolidation, subdivision or exchange of shares, a sale by the Company of all or part of its assets, any distribution to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend, partial or complete liquidation of the Company or other extraordinary or unusual event, the Committee or Board, as applicable, shall make such adjustment in (a) the class and maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered under the Plan as described in Section 5.1 and the Award limits under Section 5.2 and Section 6.3, (b) the class, number and exercise price of outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, and (c) the class and number of shares subject to any other Awards granted under the Plan (provided that the number of shares of any class subject to Awards shall always be a whole number), as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee or Board, as applicable, and such adjustments shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan. 
 14.2 Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation . In the event of any merger, consolidation or similar transaction as a result of which the holders of shares of Common Stock receive consideration consisting exclusively of securities of the surviving entity (or the parent of the surviving entity) in such transaction, the Committee or Board, as applicable, shall, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Committee or Board, as applicable, adjust each Award outstanding on the date of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction so that it pertains and applies to the securities which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award would have received in such merger, consolidation or similar transaction. 
 14.3 Assumption or Substitution of Awards . In the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets (on a consolidated basis) or a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company in which the holders of shares of Common Stock receive securities and or other property, including cash, other than shares of the surviving entity in such transaction (or the parent of such surviving entity), the Committee or Board, as applicable, shall, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Committee or Board, as applicable, have the power to provide for the exchange of each Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested) for an Award with respect to (a) some or all of the property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award would have received in such transaction or (b) securities of the acquirer or surviving entity (or parent of such acquirer or surviving entity) and, incident thereto, make an equitable adjustment as determined by the Committee or Board, as applicable, in the exercise price of the Award, or the number of shares or amount of property subject to the Award or provide for a payment (in cash or other property) to the Participant to whom such Award was granted in partial consideration for the exchange of the Award provided, however, that in the event that the acquirer does not agree to the assumption or substitution of Awards in the foregoing manner, the Committee shall, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Committee or Board, as applicable, have the power to cancel, effective immediately prior to the occurrence of such event, each Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested), and, in full consideration of such cancellation, pay to the Participant to whom such Award was granted an amount in cash, for each share of Common Stock subject to such Award, equal to the value, as determined by the Committee or Board, as applicable, of such Award, provided that with respect to any outstanding Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right such value shall be equal to the excess of (i) the value, as determined by the Committee or Board, as applicable, of the property (including cash) received by the holder of shares of Common Stock as a result of such event, over (ii) the exercise price of such Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, provided further that the value of any outstanding Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be zero where the exercise price of such Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right is greater than the value, as determined by the Committee or Board, as applicable, of the property 
 13 

(including cash) received by the holder of shares of Common Stock as a result of such event and that no change to the original timing of payment will be made to the extent it would violate Section 409A. 
 
 SECTION 15. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY BY PARTICIPANT 
 
 A Participant may designate a beneficiary to exercise, or to receive any payment or settlement to which he may be entitled in respect of, any Award under the Plan in the event of his death in a manner determined by the Committee in its discretion. If a Participant did not designate a beneficiary under this Section 15, or if no designated beneficiary survives the Participant and is living on the date on which any amount becomes payable to such Participant, the term beneficiary as used in the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be deemed to be the legal representatives of the Participant s estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to receive a settlement or payment of (or to exercise) an Award under the Plan, the Committee in its discretion may determine that the Award in question be settled or paid to (or exercised by) the legal representatives of the Participant s estate, in which event the Company, the Board and the Committee and the members thereof will have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Award. 
 
 SECTION 16. AMENDMENT OF PLAN OR AWARDS 
 
 The Plan may be amended in whole or in part at any time and from time to time by the Board, and the terms of any outstanding Award under the Plan may be amended from time to time by the Committee or Board, as applicable, in its discretion in any manner that it deems necessary or appropriate provided however, that no amendment may be made without shareholder approval if such amendment would 
 (a) increase the number of shares available for grant specified in Section 5.1 (other than pursuant to Section 14) 
 (b) decrease the minimum Stock Option exercise price set forth in Section 7.2 or the minimum Stock Appreciation Rights exercise price set forth in Section 8.2 (in each case, other than changes made pursuant to Section 14) 
 (c) reduce the minimum vesting or performance periods set forth in Section 7.4, Section 8.4, Section 9.5, Section 10.3, Section 11.3 and Section 12.1(b) 
 (d) change the Award limits set forth in Section 5.2 or Section 6.3 (other than pursuant to Section 14) or 
 (e) amend or repeal the prohibition against repricing or exchange set forth in Section 3.3. 
 
 No such amendment shall adversely affect in a material manner any right of a Participant under an Award without his written consent. Any shareholder approval requirement under the Plan will be met if such approval is obtained in accordance with applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment to the Plan or any outstanding Award under the Plan shall be made in a manner as to ensure that an Award intended to be exempt from Section 409A will continue to be exempt from Section 409A and that an Award intended to comply with Section 409A will continue to comply with Section 409A. 
 
 SECTION 17. PLAN TERMINATION 
 
 17.1 Suspension . The Plan may be suspended in whole or in part at any time and from time to time by the Board 
 17.2 Termination . The Plan shall terminate upon the adoption of a resolution of the Board terminating the Plan. No Award may be granted under the Plan after the date that is 10 years from the date the Plan was last approved and adopted by the shareholders of the Company. No termination of the Plan shall materially alter or impair any of the rights or obligations of any person, without his consent, under any Award theretofore granted under the Plan, except that subsequent to termination of the Plan, the Committee may make amendments permitted under Section 16. 
 
 14 

SECTION 18. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
 
 18.1 Loans . No loans from the Company or any Affiliate to a Participant shall be permitted in connection with the Plan. 
 18.2 Reservation of Rights of Company . No employee or other person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any employee or other person any right to continue to be employed by or perform services for the Company or any Affiliate, and the right to terminate the employment of or performance of services by any Participant at any time and for any reason is specifically reserved. 
 18.3 Non-Uniform Treatment . Determinations made by the Committee under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made selectively among eligible individuals under the Plan, whether or not such eligible individuals are similarly situated. 
 18.4 General Conditions of Awards . No Participant or other person shall have any right with respect to the Plan, the shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan or in any Award, contingent or otherwise, until written evidence of the Award shall have been delivered to the recipient and all the terms, conditions and provisions of the Plan and the Award applicable to such recipient (and each person claiming under or through him) have been met. 
 18.5 Rights as a Shareholder . Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion, a Participant holding Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Equivalents, Other Stock-Based Awards, Performance Grants or other Awards shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock (or as a holder with respect to other securities), if any, issuable pursuant to any such Award until the date of the issuance of a stock certificate to him or the entry on his behalf of an uncertificated book position on the records of the Company s transfer agent and registrar for such shares of Common Stock or other instrument of ownership, if any. Except as provided in Section 14, no adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights (whether ordinary or extraordinary, and whether in cash, securities, other property or other forms of consideration, or any combination thereof) for which the record date is prior to the date such book entry is made or a stock certificate or other instrument of ownership, if any, is issued. 
 18.6 Compliance with Applicable Laws . No shares of Common Stock or other property shall be issued or paid hereunder with respect to any Award unless counsel for the Company shall be satisfied that such issuance will be in compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign legal, securities exchange and other applicable requirements. The Company shall be under no obligation to effect the registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of any shares of Common Stock to be issued hereunder or to effect similar compliance under any state or local laws. 
 18.7 Withholding of Taxes . The Company and its Affiliates shall have the right to deduct from any payment made under the Plan the federal, state, local or foreign income or other taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment. In accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee, the required withholding obligations may be settled with shares of Common Stock, including shares of Common Stock that are part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement (up to the Participant s minimum required tax withholding rate or such other rate that will not trigger a negative accounting impact). It shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock or other property, or any combination thereof, upon exercise, settlement or payment of any Award under the Plan, that the Participant pay to the Company, upon its demand, such amount as may be requested by the Company for the purpose of satisfying any liability to withhold federal, state, local or foreign income or other taxes. If the amount requested is not paid, the Company may refuse to issue or pay shares of Common Stock or other property, or any combination thereof. Notwithstanding anything 
 in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in its discretion, permit an eligible Participant to elect to pay a portion or all of the amount requested by the Company for such taxes with respect to such Award, at such time and in such manner as the Committee shall deem to be appropriate (including, but not limited to, by authorizing the Company to withhold, or agreeing to surrender to the Company on or about the date such tax liability is determinable, shares of Common Stock or other property, or any combination thereof that would otherwise be distributed, or have been distributed, as the case may be, pursuant to such Award to such person, having a fair market value equal to the amount of such taxes). 
 15 

18.8 Unfunded Nature of Plan . The Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any Award under the Plan, and the rights to the payment of Awards shall be no greater than the rights of the Company s general creditors. 
 18.9 Consent . By accepting any Award or other benefit under the Plan, each Participant and each person claiming under or through him shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated his acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action taken under the Plan by the Company, the Board or the Committee. 
 18.10 No Warranty of Tax Effect . Although the Company may structure an Award to qualify for favorable federal, state, local or foreign tax treatment, or to avoid adverse tax treatment, no person connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited to, the Company and its directors, officers, agents and employees, makes any representation, commitment or guarantee that any intended tax treatment will be applicable with respect to any Award under the Plan, or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a Participant or his or her beneficiary. Furthermore, the existence of an Award shall not affect the right or power of the Company or its shareholders to take any corporate action, regardless of the potential effect of such action on the tax treatment of an Award under the Plan. 
 18.11 Interpretation . Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to Sections in the Plan refer to Sections of the Plan. Headings of Sections herein are inserted only for convenience of reference and are not to be considered in the construction of the Plan. In the Plan, the use of the masculine pronoun shall include the feminine and the use of the singular shall include the plural, as appropriate. 
 18.12 Severability . If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall 
 (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. 
 18.13 Choice of Law . The validity, construction, interpretation, administration and effect of the Plan, and of its rules and regulations, and rights relating to the Plan and to Awards granted under the Plan, shall be governed by the substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of the State of Missouri. 
 18.14 Venue . Any legal action against the Plan, the Company, an Affiliate or the Committee may only be brought in the Circuit Court in St. Louis County or the United States District Court in St. Louis, Missouri. 
 18.15 Section 409A . Awards granted under the Plan are intended to qualify for an exception from or comply with Section 409A, and the Plan and Award Agreements shall be administered, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof is subject to Section 409A, the Award shall be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A and any Section 409A compliance policy of the Company. To the extent any payment of an Award may be classified as a short-term deferral within the meaning of Section 409A, such payment will be deemed a short-term deferral, even if it may also qualify for an exemption from Section 409A under another provision of Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Participant is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A(2)(B)) as of the date of such Participant s separation from service (as determined pursuant to Section 409A), then to the extent any Award payable to such Participant on account of such separation from service would be considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, such payment or benefit shall be paid or provided in a lump sum upon expiration of the Delay Period. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, any provision of the Plan that would cause the grant of an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof to fail exemption from or compliance with Section 409A may be amended to qualify for exemption from or comply with Section 409A, which may be made on a retroactive basis, in accordance with Section 409A. 
 
 16 

SECTION 19. SHAREHOLDER ADOPTION 
 
 The Plan originally became effective upon the approval and adoption of the Plan by the shareholders of the Company on January 26, 2018. The Plan, as amended and restated, shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for their approval and adoption at a meeting to be held on February 3, 2023, or at any adjournment thereof. The shareholders shall be deemed to have approved and adopted the Plan, as amended and restated, only if it is approved and adopted at a meeting of the shareholders duly held by vote taken in the manner required by the laws of the State of Missouri.

Edgewell Personal Care Company Insider Trading Policy 
 
 Transactions in Company Securities 

July 2023 
 
 1 

LETTER FROM ROD LITTLE 
 
 Dear Teammates 

As a publicly owned corporation, Edgewell Personal Care Company is subject to various federal and state securities laws. The insider trading rules are perhaps the most publicized of these laws, and they can affect each of us directly. These laws apply to each director, officer and employee of the Company no one is exempt. 

You are urged to read this policy carefully and to contact the Edgewell Legal Department if you have any questions. The penalties for violating the insider trading rules can be very severe, and can be imposed against the offending individuals as well as the Company. 

The securities laws are comprehensive and far-reaching. This pamphlet provides answers to some of the more common questions relating to trading in Company securities. However, it does not attempt to deal with all the subtleties that may be applicable to a particular individual or to an unusual situation or transaction. 

Full compliance with the securities laws is both the policy of the Company and the legal obligation of its employees. 

Rod R. Little 
 President and Chief Executive Officer Edgewell Personal Care Company

EDGEWELL PERSONAL CARE COMPANY INSIDER TRADING POLICY 
 
 Purpose 
 The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Edgewell directors, officers and employees do not violate the insider trading laws by trading in securities of Edgewell or other companies while in possession or aware of material non-public information .

 Scope 
 This policy applies to the members of the Board of Directors and all officers and employees of Edgewell and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.

Edgewell has adopted this policy to assure that its directors, officers and employees do not buy or sell Edgewell stock or other securities while in possession or aware of material non-public information. 
 
 Non-public information is information that has not been publicly released or absorbed by the market. In order for information to become public, it must be widely disseminated and sufficient time must pass for it to become available in the market.

If you have any doubt at all about whether you possess or are aware of any material non- public information, you should consult with Edgewell s Chief Financial Officer or Chief Legal Officer prior to trading. 
 No Speculative Trading or Hedging Transactions . Directors, officers and employees or their designees shall not engage in speculative trading or hedging transactions in Edgewell securities. Edgewell policy prohibits directors, officers and employees and their designees from purchasing any financial instruments or entering into any other arrangements designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Edgewell securities. Directors, officers and employees may not 
 
 Invest or trade in market-traded options i.e. , puts and calls or 
 
 Purchase financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) that are designed to profit from, hedge or offset any change in the market value of equity securities (1) granted to the director, officer or employee by Edgewell as part of the compensation of the director, officer or employee or (2) held, directly or indirectly, by the director, officer or employee or 
 
 Engage in short-sales i.e ., selling Edgewell stock not owned at the time of the sale or 
 
 Speculate on relatively short-term price movements i.e ., engage in a purchase and sale of Edgewell stock within a short period of time 
 
 Transfer funds into or out of Edgewell stock equivalent funds in Edgewell s benefit plans while in possession or aware of material non-public information or 
 
 Engage in any transaction that suggests the misuse of information that is unavailable to the general public. 
 No Tipping. Directors, officers and employees in possession or aware of material non-public information concerning Edgewell shall refrain from disclosing such information to other individuals until it has been publicly released by Edgewell, except as necessary in the course of employment or service on the Board. Directors, officers and employees may also disclose material non-public information to outside persons (such as attorneys, accountants and consultants), but only where necessary to accomplish Edgewell business. In such instances, there must be in place assurances that the outside party will maintain the confidentiality of the information and not use the information for trading purposes or to tip others. 
 
 You may not permit any member of your immediate family or anyone acting on your behalf to buy or sell securities that may be affected by the information. You may not publish material 
 non-public information on publicly accessible sites on the Internet, such as chat rooms or bulletin boards. 
 No Margin Accounts or Pledges Edgewell policy prohibits directors, officers and employees from purchasing Edgewell securities on margin, holding Edgewell securities in a margin account, or pledging Edgewell securities as collateral without regard to whether you are in possession or aware of any material non-public information. 
 4 

Short Sales and Sales Against the Box Edgewell policy prohibits directors, officers and employees from entering into a short-sale transaction (selling the stock before owning it) or a sale against the box transaction (loaning stock to another individual and receiving cash back as security for the loan) without regard to whether you are in possession or aware of any material non-public information. 
 
 Puts, Calls and Market Options Edgewell policy prohibits directors, officers and employees from entering into transactions involving market-traded puts or calls in Edgewell securities without regard to whether you are in possession or aware of any material non-public information. 
 
 Investment Clubs An Edgewell d irector, officer or employee in an investment club or similar syndicate arrangement may be deemed to impute his or her material non-public information to the club's investment committee or the other club members. Thus, trading in Edgewell securities by the investment club while the individual-member possesses or is aware of material non-public information may violate the insider trading rules. 
 
 Additional Restrictions on Edgewell Insiders 
 Closed Window Periods . The officers and members of the Board of Directors of Edgewell, and certain other Edgewell employees designated from time to time by Edgewell s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer, will be notified that they have been identified as having regular access to material confidential information about Edgewell, and will be considered Edgewell Insiders. As a result of their access to this material confidential information, Edgewell Insiders are prohibited from trading in Edgewell securities during the period beginning on the sixth business day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continuing until the second business day following the issuance of Edgewell s press release of its financial results for the reporting period that includes such calendar quarter (each of these periods called a closed window period ). For example, if Edgewell releases its financial results for the second calendar quarter of a given year on Tuesday, April 27 and the following Wednesday and Thursday are business days, then Edgewell Insiders could trade in Edgewell securities beginning on April 29 of such year until 
 June 7 of such year. These periods are referred to as open window periods. However, even during these open window periods, an Edgewell Insider is prohibited from trading if the individual is aware of material non-public information about Edgewell . 
 
 Pre-Clearance for Edgewell Insiders . In addition to the prohibition on trading in a closed window period, Edgewell Insiders are required to pre-clear all trades in Edgewell securities with Edgewell s Chief Financial Officer or Chief Legal Officer, even if not in possession or aware of specific material non-public information. An Edgewell Insider may not trade, even with pre- clearance, if he or she is actually in possession or aware of material non-public information. 
 
 5 

Trading Under a Pre-Planned Trading Program . Edgewell Insiders will be permitted to trade pursuant to Pre-Planned Trading Programs. A Pre-Planned Trading Program must be in writing and must meet the requirements of the rules of the SEC, as they may exist from time to time, for establishing that a transaction in a company s securities was not made on the basis of material non-public information (currently contained in Rule 10b5-1). A Pre-Planned Trading Program may only be put into place or modified when the Edgewell Insider is not in possession or aware of material non-public information and must be in effect prior to the first day of the last month of then current quarter (i.e., an Edgewell Insider may establish a 10b5-1 Plan during the third fiscal quarter only prior to June 1). To assure compliance with this policy, Edgewell Insiders must obtain approval of Edgewell s Chief Financial Officer or Chief Legal Officer and demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 prior to establishing a Pre-Planned Trading Program. 
 
 Benefit Plan Transactions. Certain Edgewell employee benefit plan transactions are not of a speculative nature aimed at short-term profits and, therefore, Edgewell will permit Edgewell Insiders to take these actions even during a closed window period so long as the Edgewell Insiders do not possess and are not aware of material non-public information. The permitted actions are 
 
 Withholding by Edgewell of stock to pay the exercise price or withholding tax liability upon exercise of a stock option. 
 Withholding by Edgewell of stock or delivery of already-owned Edgewell stock to pay withholding tax liability on shares of Edgewell stock issued as restricted stock. 
 
 Penalties 
 Under federal securities laws, insider trading can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, including fines of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided, as well as imprisonment. Edgewell, as the employer, could also be liable for fines of 1 million or more as a result of an employee s insider trading or tipping. 
 
 VIOLATIONS OF EDGEWELL S INSIDER TRADING POLICY WILL BE CONSIDERED GROUNDS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION, 
 UP TO AND INCLUDING TERMINATION. 
 
 Administration of Policy 
 Any person who has any questions about specific transactions may obtain additional guidance from the Edgewell Legal Department. Edgewell reserves the right to amend and interpret this policy from time to time.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 

1. SOMEONE LEFT A DRAFT OF A PRESS RELEASE IN THE COPY ROOM ANNOUNCING A NEW JOINT VENTURE FOR EDGEWELL. MAY I PURCHASE EDGEWELL STOCK KNOWING THAT INFORMATION MAY I PURCHASE STOCK IN THE OTHER COMPANY IF IT IS PUBLICLY TRADED 
 No. If the joint venture is significant (and it probably is if Edgewell is issuing a press release) you may not purchase Edgewell stock or stock in the other company until it has been publicly announced. If you are in doubt about the significance of the joint venture, you should consult Edgewell s Chief Legal Officer. 
 2. I HAVE INVESTED IN A MUTUAL FUND. ARE PURCHASES AND SALES OF EDGEWELL STOCK BY THE MUTUAL FUND COVERED BY THIS POLICY 
 No. No violation of this policy occurs if a mutual fund in which you have made an investment buys or sells Edgewell stock while you are in possession or aware of material non-public information, because you have no control over the fund s decision to buy or sell the securities, so long as Edgewell stock represents an insignificant portion of the mutual fund portfolio. 
 3. I KNOW THAT EDGEWELL IS GOING TO PLACE AN ORDER FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF MACHINES WITH ONE OF OUR VENDORS. THE VENDOR IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND THIS ORDER WILL BE VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM. I WOULD EXPECT THE VENDOR S STOCK PRICE TO RISE UPON NEWS OF THE ORDER. MAY I BUY STOCK IN THE VENDOR S COMPANY 
 No. You may not buy stock in the vendor until this information is known to the public. You learned the information in the course of your work for Edgewell and cannot trade on it until it is publicly known. 
 4. WHAT IF I HAVE VALID REASONS FOR TRADING 
 Even if you have valid reasons for trading in Edgewell securities (such as selling stock to obtain cash for school tuition, pay medical bills or make a down payment on a new home), they will not excuse you from complying with the insider trading rules if you are in possession or aware of material non-public information. 
 5. CAN I EXERCISE OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY 
 If you engage in a cashless exercise in which a broker pays the exercise price, sells the shares acquired upon exercise, and then remits the net cash proceeds to you, the broker is, in effect, selling the shares on your behalf. If you are in possession or aware of material non-public information at the time, the sale would violate the insider trading rules. 
 However, if you were to use cash to pay the exercise price in full, you may exercise options granted by Edgewell, even if you are in possession or aware of material non- public information. Because you are acquiring the shares from Edgewell, there would 
 7 

not be a trade involving a third party that did not have access to the material non-public information. 
 6. WHAT ABOUT TRANSACTIONS IN COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS 
 Deferral by Edgewell directors in the Edgewell stock equivalent fund of the Deferred Compensation Plan does not involve actual investment in shares of Edgewell stock. However, this policy prohibits a director from making transfers into or out of this fund if the director is in possession or aware of material non-public information. Elections to defer directors fees into this plan are not subject to this policy. 
 7. THE POLICY SAYS THAT I MAY NOT PERMIT ANY MEMBER OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY TO BUY OR SELL EDGEWELL STOCK WHILE I AM AWARE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION. FOR THESE PURPOSES, WHO IS CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY 
 Your immediate family is any member of your family (spouse, children, grandchildren, siblings, parents, grandparents and in-laws) who shares your household , as well as any member of your family for whom you provide substantial financial support. These people may be presumed to have the same information you have and should not trade while you have material non-public information. 
 
 8. WILL A GIFT OF EDGEWELL COMMON STOCK VIOLATE THE INSIDER TRADING RULES 
 A bona fide gift is not considered a sale of Edgewell stock for purposes of the insider trading rules. However, gifts to relatives, friends or business associates who quickly sell such shares may appear to circumvent the insider trading rules. The Edgewell Legal Department recommends that such transactions be avoided. 
 9. HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM AN EDGEWELL INSIDER 
 You will be notified by Edgewell s Chief Financial Officer or Chief Legal Officer or the Edgewell Legal Department if you have been identified as an Edgewell Insider. In general, Edgewell Insiders are employees in senior roles who have regular access to material confidential information about Edgewell.

 Exhibit 97.1 

 Edgewell Personal Care Company Compensation Recovery Policy 
 1. Purpose . This Policy sets forth the terms on which the Company may recover erroneously awarded compensation to its executive officers. This Policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. 
 
 2. Definitions . Unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms used in this Policy shall have the following meanings 
 
 (a) Board means the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 
 (b) Committee means the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board. 
 
 (c) Company means Edgewell Personal Care Company. 
 
 (d) Exchange means the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
 (e) Exchange Act means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time, and any successor thereto. 
 
 (f) erroneously awarded compensation has the meaning set forth in Section 3(c). 
 
 (g) executive officer means the Company s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any 
 vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. An executive officer for purposes of this Policy includes at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
 
 (h) financial reporting measures means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also financial reporting measures. 
 
 (i) incentive-based compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. 
 
 (j) Policy means this Edgewell Personal Care Company Compensation Recovery Policy, as in effect from time to time. 
 
 (k) received has the following meaning incentive-based compensation is deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 
 (l) SEC means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 3. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation . The Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of erroneously awarded compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the 
 1 

Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 
 (a) Scope of Policy . This Policy shall apply to all incentive-based compensation received by a person 
 
 (i) After beginning service as an executive officer 
 
 (ii) Who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that incentive-based compensation 
 
 (iii) While the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association and 
 
 (iv) During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3. In addition to these last three completed fiscal years, this Policy shall apply to any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. However, a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year. The Company s obligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. 
 
 (b) Date of Accounting Restatement . The date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3 is the earlier to occur of 
 
 (i) the date on which the Board, a committee thereof or the Company s officer(s) authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3 and 
 
 (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement as described in the first paragraph of this Section 3. 
 
 (c) Amount Subject to Recovery . The amount of incentive-based compensation subject to this Policy erroneously awarded compensation is the amount of incentive-based compensation received that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and shall be computed without regard to any taxes paid. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement (i) the amount shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was received and 
 (ii) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange. 
 
 2 

(d) Impracticability of Recovery . The Company shall recover erroneously awarded compensation in compliance with this Policy except to the extent that the conditions of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) below are met, and the Committee (or in the absence thereof, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board) has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. 
 
 (i) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange. 
 
 (ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation, and shall provide such opinion to the Exchange. 
 
 (iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 
 (e) Prohibition on Indemnification . The Company shall not indemnify any current or former executive officer against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation. 
 
 (f) Method of Recovery . The Committee shall determine, in its sole and exclusive discretion, the method or methods for recovering any erroneously awarded compensation, which methods need not be the same, or applied in the same manner, to each executive officer, provided that any such method shall provide for reasonably prompt recovery and otherwise comply with any requirements of the Exchange. 
 
 4. Disclosure . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the applicable rules of the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall file the disclosures set forth below. 
 
 (a) Publication of this Policy . The Company shall file a copy of this Policy as an exhibit to its annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 (b) Annual Report Check Mark . The Company shall indicate by check mark on the cover page to its annual report on Form 10-K (i) whether the financial statements of the Company included in the filing reflect the correction of an error to previously issued financial statements and (ii) whether any of those error corrections are restatements that required a recovery analysis of incentive-based compensation pursuant to this Policy. 
 
 (c) Disclosure of Action to Recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation . The Company shall make the disclosures set forth below in proxy or information statements that call for disclosure pursuant to Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K and its annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 3 

(i) If at any time during or after the last completed fiscal year the Company was required to prepare an accounting restatement that required recovery of erroneously awarded compensation pursuant to this Policy, or there was an outstanding balance as of the end of the last completed fiscal year of erroneously awarded compensation to be recovered from the application of this Policy to a prior restatement, the Company shall provide the following information 
 
 (1) For each restatement 
 
 A. The date on which the Company was required to prepare an accounting restatement 
 
 B. The aggregate dollar amount of erroneously awarded compensation attributable to such accounting restatement, including an analysis of how the amount was calculated 
 
 C. If the financial reporting measure related to a stock price or total shareholder return metric, the estimates that were used in determining the erroneously awarded compensation attributable to such accounting restatement and an explanation of the methodology used for such estimates 
 
 D. The aggregate dollar amount of erroneously awarded compensation that remains outstanding at the end of the last completed fiscal year and 
 
 E. If the aggregate dollar amount of erroneously awarded compensation has not yet been determined, disclosure of this fact, an explanation of the reason(s) and disclosure the information required in the foregoing clauses (B) through (D) in the next filing that is required to include disclosure pursuant to Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K 
 
 (2) If recovery would be impracticable pursuant to Section 3(d), for each current and former named executive officer and for all other current and former executive officers as a group, disclose the amount of recovery forgone and a brief description of the reason the Company decided in each case not to pursue recovery and 
 
 (3) For each current and former named executive officer from whom, as of the end of the last completed fiscal year, erroneously awarded compensation had been outstanding for 180 days or longer since the date the Company determined the amount the individual owed, disclose the dollar amount of outstanding erroneously awarded compensation due from each such individual. 
 
 (ii) If at any time during or after its last completed fiscal year the Company was required to prepare an accounting restatement, and the Company concluded that recovery of erroneously awarded compensation was not required pursuant to this Policy, a brief explanation of why application of this Policy resulted in this conclusion. 
 
 4 

5. Administration . 
 
 (a) Effective Date . This Policy shall take effect on October 2, 2023 and shall replace the April 2017 Edgewell Personal Care Company Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy in its entirety. 
 
 (b) Authority of Committee . This Policy shall be administered and interpreted by the Committee in accordance with Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Section 10D of the Exchange Act and other applicable Federal securities laws and regulations. Except as limited by applicable law, and subject to the provisions of this Policy, the Committee shall have full power, authority and sole and exclusive discretion to construe, interpret and administer this Policy, and to delegate its authority pursuant to this Policy.

 Committee shall be understood to refer to the full Board. 
 
 (c) Decisions Binding .

Any action taken by, or inaction of, the Committee or its delegates relating to or pursuant to this Policy shall be within the absolute discretion of the Committee or its delegates. Such action or inaction of the Committee or its delegates shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and any current or former executive officer affected by such action or inaction. 
 
 (d) Policy Not Exclusive . Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery, recoupment, forfeiture or offset that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any other applicable Company policy, compensation or benefit plan, agreement or arrangement or other agreement or applicable law provided , however , that there shall be no duplication of recovery of the same compensation.
