CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q of SmartStop Self Storage REIT, Inc., other than historical facts, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, believe, seek, continue, or other similar words. 
 Any such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, and beliefs of, and assumptions made by, our management and involve uncertainties that could significantly affect our financial results. Such statements include, but are not limited to: (i) statements about our plans, strategies, initiatives, and prospects; and (ii) statements about our future results of operations, capital expenditures, and liquidity. Such statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including, without limitation: 
 We have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations; therefore, we will have fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties, and our stockholders overall return may be reduced. 

There is currently no public trading market for our shares and there may never be one; therefore, it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares. Our charter does not require us to pursue a liquidity transaction at any time. 

Our share redemption program is partially suspended, and even if stockholders are able to have their shares redeemed, our stockholders may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares. 

We have issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that ranks senior to all common stock and grants the holder superior rights compared to common stockholders, which may have the effect of diluting our stockholders interests in us and discouraging a takeover or other similar transaction. 

We may only calculate the estimated value per share for our shares annually and, therefore, our stockholders may not be able to determine the estimated net asset value of their shares on an ongoing basis. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results. 

Our future results may suffer as a result of the effect of recent affiliated mergers, acquisitions and other strategic transactions. 

Certain of our officers and key personnel will face competing demands relating to their time and will face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with affiliated entities, which could cause our business to suffer. 

Revenue and earnings from the Managed REIT Platform are uncertain. 

A subsidiary of ours is the sponsor of the Managed REITs and may sponsor additional future programs. As a result, we could be subject to any litigation that may arise by investors in those entities or the respective operations of those entities. 

Because we are focused on the self storage industry, our rental revenues will be significantly influenced by demand for self storage space generally, and a decrease in such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. 

A high concentration of our properties in a particular geographic area would magnify the effects of downturns in that geographic area. 

Property taxes may increase, which would adversely affect our net operating income and cash available for distributions. 

If we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits. 

3 

Changes in the Canadian Dollar ("CAD")/U.S. Dollar ("USD") exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and value of the investment of our stockholders. 

We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to continue to pay distributions at the current rate and could decrease the value of our stockholders investments. 

We have incurred and intend to continue to incur, mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings, which may increase our business risks. 

If we or the other parties to our loans or secured notes payable, as applicable, breach covenants thereunder, such loan or loans or secured notes payable could be deemed in default, which could accelerate our repayment date and materially adversely affect the value of our stockholders investment in us. 

Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to continue to pay distributions at the current rate to our stockholders. 

Failure to continue to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to continue to pay distributions at our current level as we will incur additional tax liabilities. 

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date this report is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business, and important factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements, please refer to the factors listed and described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Risk Factors sections of the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC, as supplemented by the risk factors included in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained from our website at www.investors.smartstopselfstorage.com.

 million and in intangible assets to recognize the value of in-place leases related to our acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We do not expect, nor to date have we recorded, intangible assets for the value of customer relationships because we expect we will not have concentrations of significant customers and the average customer turnover will be fairly frequent. Allocation of purchase price to acquisitions of portfolios of facilities are allocated to the individual facilities based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual facility along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. Acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business, as defined under current GAAP, are accounted for as asset acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our property acquisitions did not meet the definition of a business. To date, our acquisitions have generally not met the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value was concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets) and because the acquisitions did not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. As a result, once an acquisition is deemed probable, acquisition related transaction costs are capitalized rather than expensed. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we expensed approximately and , respectively, of acquisition-related transaction costs that did not meet our capitalization policy during the respective periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we expensed approximately and , respectively, of acquisition-related transaction costs that did not meet our capitalization policy during the respective periods. 
 real property asset impairment losses were recognized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a casualty loss in connection with damage to of our wholly-owned properties caused by Hurricane Helene. Please see Note 3 Real Estate for additional detail.

Trademarks are valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks, we would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name. By virtue of this asset, we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible fair value of our ownership of the brand name. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million was recorded related to the SmartStop Self Storage trademark, which is an indefinite lived trademark.

 through August 6, 2024 for such class Y and Z shares. The Series C Units shall automatically convert into class A units of SST VI OP on a one-to-one basis upon SST VI s disclosure of an estimated net asset value per share equal to at least per share for each class of SST VI shares of common stock, including the class Y shares and class Z shares, calculated net of the Series C Units to be converted. On August 7, 2024, SST VI declared an estimated net asset value per share of . Since the Series C Units that could be converted would result in the net asset value falling below per share, none of the Series C Units we own were converted into class A units of SST VI OP, and our future purchases will be determined based on the current estimated net asset value at such time. Subsequent to SST VI declaring an estimated net asset value of per share, the number of Series C Units SmartStop receives in exchange for funding the front-end sales load of the sale of SST VI's class Y and class Z shares is calculated as the dollar amount of such sponsor funding divided by the current offering price of per share for such class Y and Z shares. In accordance with ASC 606, the amount by which our funding exceeds the fair value of the Series C Units received is accounted for as a payment to a customer and is therefore recorded as a reduction to the transaction price for the services we provide to such customer. Each payment is initially included in the Other assets line-item in our consolidated balance sheet and subsequently recorded as a reduction of Managed REIT Platform revenues ratably over the remaining estimated life of our management contracts with SST VI.

 of the REIT s taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gains and which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). For income tax purposes, distributions to common stockholders are characterized as ordinary dividends, capital gain dividends, or as nontaxable distributions. To the extent that we make a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the tax basis in each U.S. stockholder s shares, and the amount of each distribution in excess of a U.S. stockholder s tax basis in its shares will be taxable as gain realized from the sale of its shares. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and intend to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state, local, and foreign taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We filed an election to treat our primary taxable REIT subsidiary TRS as a taxable REIT subsidiary effective January 1, 2014. In general, our TRS performs additional services for our customers and provides the advisory and property management services to the Managed REITs and otherwise generally engages in non-real estate related business. The TRS is subject to corporate federal and state income tax. We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
 Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur.
 Uncertain tax positions may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment. Under ASC Topic 740, tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more likely than not threshold, and those tax positions requiring recognition are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. Income taxes payable are classified within accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The tax years 2020-2023 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.

 wholly-owned properties in this market was severely flooded. As a result of the storm event, flooding and related damage, we recorded a net casualty loss related to this property of approximately million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to write-off the carrying value. We expect to rebuild and therefore we believe it is probable that we will receive insurance proceeds to offset the casualty loss and have recorded a receivable related to our pending insurance claims. Consequently the casualty loss was completely offset in our consolidated statements of operations by such recovery. Any amount of insurance recovery related to the property damage in excess of the casualty loss incurred is considered a gain contingency, and will be recognized upon final settlement of the claims.

The first two years of the Canadian Term Loan are interest only, after which it requires monthly amortizing payments based on a amortization schedule. 

 The weighted average interest rate on our consolidated debt, excluding the impact of our interest rate hedging activities, as of September 30, 2024 was approximately . We are subject to certain restrictive covenants, as amended, relating to the outstanding debt, and as of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants. KeyBank Bridge Loan On July 31, 2024, we entered into a bridge loan with KeyBank for up to million (the KeyBank Bridge Loan which matures on . The KeyBank Bridge Loan was able to be funded in up to two draws, neither of which could occur after 90 days from closing. No amounts borrowed and repaid under such loan were available to be redrawn. At closing, we drew million. There were no subsequent draws within 90 days after initial closing, and we no longer have the ability to draw additional funds pursuant to this loan. The KeyBank Bridge Loan was completed in connection with SSGT III's acquisition of self storage facilities on July 31, 2024, whereby our Operating Partnership provided a similar bridge loan to an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SSGT III for million (the SSGT III Bridge Loan to facilitate SSGT III s closing on such properties. An indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SSGT III is sponsoring a private offering of beneficial interests in a Delaware statutory trust ("DST") relating to the two properties. We, through a newly formed subsidiary of SmartStop REIT Advisors, LLC ("SRA"), will serve as property manager of both of these properties. The KeyBank Bridge Loan incurs interest based on adjusted daily simple SOFR plus basis points. The SSGT III Bridge Loan incurs interest based on adjusted daily simple SOFR plus basis points. The SSGT III Bridge Loan is secured by an indirect pledge of equity in the entity sponsoring the private DST offering relating to the two properties mentioned above, as well as a full guaranty by SSGT III OP. We have pledged the SSGT III Bridge Loan to KeyBank as the collateral for the KeyBank Bridge Loan, as well as provided a full guaranty from our Operating Partnership. As such sponsor entity sells such DST interests, it is required to utilize such net proceeds to pay down the SSGT III Bridge Loan and we are similarly required to use such net proceeds to pay down the KeyBank Bridge Loan. In any event, we will be required to pay down at least of the balance within four months, within six months, within nine months, and within twelve months from the final draw. Full repayment is subject to one six month extension option. Similar required paydowns are also required of SSGT III pursuant to the terms of the SSGT III Bridge Loan. 2024 Credit Facility On February 22, 2024, we through our Operating Partnership (the Borrower ), entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with KeyBank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent, certain others listed as joint book runners, joint lead arrangers, syndication agents and documentation agents, and certain other lenders party thereto, (the "2024 Credit Facility"). The 2024 Credit Facility replaced the Credit Facility (defined below) the Company entered into on March 17, 2021, and has a maturity date of February 22, 2027. The aggregate commitment of the 2024 Credit Facility is million. The Borrower has the right to request to increase the commitment amount available under the 2024 Credit Facility by an additional million, for a total potential maximum aggregate amount of billion, subject to certain conditions. The 2024 Credit Facility also includes sublimits of (a) up to million for letters of credit and (b) up to million for swingline loans; each of these sublimits are part of, and not in addition to, the amounts available under the 2024 Credit Facility. Borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility may be in either USD or CAD. Upon the closing of the 2024 Credit Facility, we immediately drew down an aggregate amount of million, which was used primarily to pay off the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.

 , subject to a extension option, subject to the payment of an extension fee of on the aggregate amount of the then-outstanding revolving commitments for such extension, and it may be prepaid or terminated at any time without penalty; provided, however, that the lenders shall be indemnified for certain breakage costs. Amounts borrowed under the 2024 Credit Facility bear interest based on the type of borrowing (either Base Rate Loans, Daily Simple SOFR Loans, Term SOFR Loans or CORRA Loans, each as defined in the 2024 Credit Facility). Base Rate Loans bear interest at the lesser of (x) the Base Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Facility) plus the applicable rate, or (y) the maximum rate. Daily Simple SOFR Loans bear interest at the lesser of (a) Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the 2024 Credit Facility) plus the applicable rate, or (b) the maximum rate. Term SOFR Loans bear interest at the lesser of (a) Term SOFR (as defined in the 2024 Credit Facility) for the interest period in effect plus the applicable rate, or (b) the maximum rate. CORRA Loans bear interest at the lesser of (a) Adjusted Daily Simple CORRA (as defined in the 2024 Credit Facility) plus the applicable rate, or (b) the maximum rate. The corresponding applicable rate varies between (i) prior to a Security Interest Termination Event (defined below), basis points to basis points for Daily Simple SOFR Loans, Term SOFR Loans and CORRA Loans and between basis points and basis points for Base Rate Loans, in each case of this clause (i), depending on the consolidated leverage ratio of the Company and (ii) following a Security Interest Termination Event, basis points to basis points for Daily Simple SOFR Loans, Term SOFR Loans and CORRA Loans and between basis points and basis points for Base Rate Loans, in each case of this clause (ii), depending on the consolidated capitalization rate leverage ratio of the Company. Initial advances under the 2024 Credit Facility are Daily Simple SOFR Loans that bear interest at basis points over Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR. The 2024 Credit Facility is also subject to an annual unused fee based upon the average amount of the unused portion of the 2024 Credit Facility, which varies from bps to bps, depending on the size of the unused amount, as well as whether a Security Interest Termination Event has occurred. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility only bore interest based on Daily Simple SOFR. The rate spread above Daily Simple SOFR at which the 2024 Credit Facility incurs interest is subject to increase based on the consolidated leverage ratio. There are five leverage tiers under the 2024 Credit Facility, with the highest tier limited to a maximum leverage of and a maximum spread of basis points on the 2024 Credit Facility. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated leverage ratio was within the second leverage tier, and this loan incurred interest at daily simple SOFR plus a spread of and the SOFR Index Adjustment of . The 2024 Credit Facility is fully recourse, jointly and severally, to us, the Borrower, and certain of our subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors ). In connection with the 2024 Credit Facility, we, the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors executed guarantees in favor of the lenders. It is an event of default under the 2024 Credit Facility if (a) there is a payment default by us, the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor under any recourse debt for borrowed money, (b) there is a payment default by us or any of its subsidiaries under any non-recourse debt of at least million or (c) prior to a Security Interest Termination Event, an event of default occurs under the 2032 Private Placement Notes. The 2024 Credit Facility is initially secured by a pledge of equity interests in the Subsidiary Guarantors. However, upon the achievement of certain security interest termination conditions, the pledges shall be released and the 2024 Credit Facility shall become unsecured (the Security Interest Termination Event ). The Security Interest Termination Event occurs at the Borrower s election, once the Borrower satisfies all of the following security interest termination conditions: (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than :1.00; (ii) an unsecured interest coverage ratio of not less than :1.00; (iii) a consolidated capitalization rate leverage ratio of not greater than ; and (iv) a secured debt ratio of no greater than . Following the occurrence of the Security Interest Termination Event, certain terms and conditions of the 2024 Credit Facility are modified, including, but not limited to: (i) in certain circumstances, a reduction in the applicable rate under the 2024 Credit Facility, (ii) the modification or addition of certain financial covenants, (iii) the addition of a floor of at least million for any cross-defaulted recourse debt of us, Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, and (iv) in certain circumstances, a reduction in the annual unused fee for the 2024 Credit Facility. The outstanding 2032 Private Placement Notes previously issued by us remain pari passu with the 2024 Credit Facility. The 2024 Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, borrowing conditions, and events of default. In particular, the financial covenants imposed on us include: a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, certain limits on both secured debt and secured recourse debt, certain payout ratios of dividends paid to adjusted funds from operations, limits on unhedged variable rate debt, and minimum liquidity. If an event of default occurs and continues, the Borrower is subject to

 million in order to fund our acquisitions of the Spartanburg and Miami Properties, to lend to the Managed REITs, and to fund other general corporate activities. Subsequent to the initial draw on the 2024 Credit Facility, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed an additional million in order to fund our acquisitions of the Colorado Springs II, Spartanburg and Miami Properties, to lend to the Managed REITs, and to fund other general corporate activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Colorado Springs II Property was added to the borrowing base of the 2024 Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, of our wholly-owned properties were encumbered by the 2024 Credit Facility, and we had borrowed approximately million of the million maximum potential current commitment of the 2024 Credit Facility. The availability of the Credit Facility is subject to certain calculations, including a debt service coverage ratio DSCR calculation which utilizes prevailing treasury rates within the calculation. As of September 30, 2024, based on the aforementioned and other borrowing base calculations, we had the ability to draw up to an additional approximately million on the current capacity of the revolver. 2027 NBC Loan On March 7, 2024, we, through five of our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries (the 2027 NBC Loan Borrowers ), entered into a loan with National Bank of Canada NBC as administrative agent, National Bank Financial as lead arranger and sole bookrunner, and certain other lenders party thereto (the 2027 NBC Loan ). On such date, we drew the maximum aggregate borrowing of million CAD pursuant to the 2027 NBC Loan. This loan is secured by the five properties owned by the 2027 NBC Loan Borrowers (the Secured NBC Properties ). Previously, four of the Secured NBC Properties were included in the borrowing base of the 2024 Credit Facility, and the other property was unencumbered. The net proceeds from the 2027 NBC Loan were used to pay down the 2024 Credit Facility by approximately million USD, and accordingly, the respective four properties were released as collateral from the 2024 Credit Facility. The 2027 NBC Loan has a maturity date of March 7, 2027, which may be extended for additional one-year periods in the discretion of the lenders. The 2027 NBC Loan carries a variable interest rate based on either the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA or the Canadian Prime Rate. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the 2027 NBC Loan were subject to interest at the CORRA rate, plus a CORRA adjustment of approximately , plus a spread of . On March 12, 2024, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement based on CORRA with NBC whereby, inclusive of the swap we fixed the interest rate on the NBC loan at for the initial three year term of the loan. The 2027 NBC Loan requires monthly amortizing principal and interest payments, which are based on a amortization schedule. The 2027 NBC Loan may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time upon prior written notice to the lenders, subject to interest rate swap breakage costs. SmartStop and the 2027 NBC Loan Borrowers provided an ordinary course environmental indemnity in favor of NBC and the lenders. SmartStop serves as a non-recourse guarantor, and each borrower provided a limited recourse guaranty up to the amount of the collateral pledged by it, under the 2027 NBC Loan. 2032 Private Placement Notes On April 19, 2022, we as guarantor, and our Operating Partnership as issuer, entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement which provides for the private placement of million of Senior Notes due (the 2032 Private Placement Notes ).

 to (a Total Leverage Ratio Event ). As of March 31, 2023, such Total Leverage Ratio Event occurred, and our 2032 Private Placement Notes began accruing interest at a rate of . The interest accruing on the 2032 Private Placement Notes will continue to accrue at 5.28 until such time as the Total Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to to for two consecutive fiscal quarters, upon such achievement, the applicable fixed interest rate will revert to and remain at that interest rate through maturity, regardless of our future Total Leverage Ratio. We are permitted to prepay at any time all, or from time to time, any part of the Notes in amounts not less than of the 2032 Private Placement Notes then outstanding at (i) 100 of the principal amount so prepaid and (ii) the make-whole amount (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement). The Make-Whole Amount is equal to the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments with respect to the 2032 Private Placement Notes being prepaid over the amount of such 2032 Private Placement Notes. In addition, in connection with a change of control (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement), the Operating Partnership is required to offer to prepay the 2032 Private Placement Notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, but without the Make Whole Amount or any other prepayment premium or penalty of any kind. The Company must also maintain a debt rating of the 2032 Private Placement Notes by a rating agency. The Note Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default that were substantially similar to the previously existing Credit Facility (defined below). The 2032 Private Placement Notes were issued on a pari passu basis with the previously existing Credit Facility, and are pari passu with the 2024 Credit Facility. As such, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors fully and unconditionally guarantee the Operating Partnership s obligations under the 2032 Private Placement Notes. The 2032 Private Placement Notes were initially secured by a pledge of equity interests in the Subsidiary Guarantors on similar terms as the previously existing Credit Facility. On April 26, 2024, we amended the Note Purchase Agreement dated April 19, 2022 (the NPA Amendment ). The primary purpose of the NPA Amendment was to make certain conforming changes between the Note Purchase Agreement and our recently amended and restated revolving credit facility, the 2024 Credit Facility. In particular, the NPA Amendment conformed certain of the definitions related to the financial tests that we are required to maintain, as well as certain of the property pool covenants we are required to satisfy, in the Note Purchase Agreement during the term thereof to those in the 2024 Credit Facility. Credit Facility On March 17, 2021, we, through our Operating Partnership (the Borrower ), entered into a credit facility with KeyBank, National Association, as administrative agent, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, Citibank, N.A., and BMO Capital Markets, Corp., as joint book runners and joint lead arrangers, and certain other lenders party thereto (the Credit Facility ). The initial aggregate amount of the Credit Facility was million, which consisted of a million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility Revolver and a million term loan (the Credit Facility Term Loan ). On October 7, 2021, the Borrower and lenders who were party to the Credit Facility amended the Credit Facility to increase the commitment on the Credit Facility by million. In connection with the increased commitment, additional lenders were added to the Credit Facility. As a result of this amendment, the aggregate commitment on the Credit Facility was million. The Credit Facility was repaid in full on February 22, 2024 in connection with the establishment of the 2024 Credit Facility.

Performance Based Awards With respect to performance based awards, the number of shares of restricted stock granted as of the grant date equaled of the targeted award, whereas the number of LTIP Units granted as of the grant date equaled of the targeted amount of the award. The targeted award for each executive was determined and approved by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors. The actual number of shares of restricted stock or LTIP Units, as applicable, to be issued upon vesting may range from to of the targeted award, such determination being based upon the results of the performance measure. Performance based awards vest based upon our performance as ranked amongst a peer group of self storage related companies. This comparison is conducted using a performance measure of average annual same-store revenue growth, analyzed over a period. Earned awards for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 grants will vest, as applicable, no later than , 2026 , and 2027 , respectively. Recipients of performance based restricted stock accrue distributions during the performance period, and such distributions will only be payable on the date that any such shares of restricted stock vest, based upon the performance level attained. of the targeted award and are entitled to receive distributions and allocations of profits and losses with respect to the performance based LTIP Units as of the effective date of each award in an amount equal to 10 of the distributions and allocations available to such LTIP Units, until the Distribution Participation Date (as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement). The remaining 90 of distributions will accrue and will be payable on the Distribution Participation Date based upon the performance level attained and number of performance based LTIP Units that vest. Following the Distribution Participation Date, recipients will be entitled to receive the full amount of distributions and allocations of profits and losses with respect to the vested performance-based LTIP Units, such amount being equivalent to distributions declared and paid on our Class A Shares.

 any rights as a stockholder with respect to the unvested portion of such restricted stock awards. Prior to vesting, shares of performance based restricted stock generally may not be transferred, other than by laws of descent and distribution. Holders of performance based LTIP Units have the same voting rights as holders of common units, voting as a class with each LTIP Unit holder having held. Prior to vesting, performance based LTIP Units generally may not be transferred, other than by laws of descent and distribution. LTIP Units are designed to qualify as profits interests in the Operating Partnership for federal income tax purposes. The profits interests characteristics of the LTIP Units mean that initially they will not be treated as economically equivalent in value to a common unit and the issuance of LTIP Units will not be a taxable event to the Operating Partnership or the recipient. If and when certain events occur pursuant to applicable tax regulations and in accordance with the Operating Partnership Agreement, LTIP Units may become economically equivalent to common units of limited partnership interest of our Operating Partnership on a one-for-one basis. As of September 30, 2024, shares of stock were available for issuance under the Plan. We recorded approximately million and million of equity based compensation expense in general and administrative expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to approximately million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We recorded approximately million and million of equity based compensation expense in property operating expenses, within our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to approximately million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested equity awards, with such cost expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years. As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested equity awards, with such cost expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years. In March 2024, an aggregate of LTIP Units were issued to our executive officers in connection with performance-based equity grants. With respect to performance-based equity grants, the number of LTIP Units granted as of the grant date was equal of the targeted award. Similarly, in March 2024, an aggregate of LTIP Units were issued to our executive officers in connection with time-based equity grants. These are non-vested grants which shall vest ratably over , with the first tranche vesting on December 31, 2024, subject to the recipient s continued employment through the applicable vesting date. 

 days written notice to the participants. The purchase price per share pursuant to our DRP is equivalent to the estimated value per share approved by our board of directors and in effect on the date of purchase of shares under the plan. In conjunction with the board of directors declaration of a new estimated value per share of our common stock on January 15, 2024, any shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan will be sold at our new estimated value per share of per Class A Share and Class T Share. Please see the section below titled Suspension and Partial Resumption of DRP and SRP for additional information. As of September 30, 2024, we had sold approximately million Class A Shares and approximately million Class T Shares through our distribution reinvestment plan, of which, approximately million Class A Shares and

 million Class T Shares were sold under our current DRP Offering. Share Redemption Program As described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Redeemable Common Stock, we have an SRP. Please refer to that section for additional details. Pursuant to the SRP, we may redeem the shares of stock presented for redemption for cash to the extent that such requests comply with the below terms of our SRP and we have sufficient funds available to fund such redemption. All redemption requests received, and not withdrawn, on or prior to the last day of the applicable quarter are processed on the last business day of the month following the end of the quarter in which the redemption requests were received. Our board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the SRP with days notice to our stockholders. We may provide this notice by including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC, or by a separate mailing to our stockholders. On August 20, 2020, our board of directors amended the terms of the SRP to revise the redemption price per share for all redemptions under the SRP to be equal to the most recently published estimated net asset value per share of the applicable share class (the SRP Amendment ). Prior to the SRP Amendment, the redemption amount was the lesser of the amount the stockholders paid for their shares or the price per share in the current offering. On January 15, 2024, we declared a new estimated net asset value per share and the redemption price under our SRP immediately changed to (our current estimated net asset value per share). There are several limitations in addition to those noted above on our ability to redeem shares under the SRP including, but not limited to: During any calendar year, we will not redeem in excess of of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. 

 The amount available for redemption is limited to the proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, less any prior redemptions. 

 We have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. 

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately million shares or million of requests that met the eligibility criteria were requested to be redeemed; approximately million of which were fulfilled during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately million of which were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and fulfilled in October 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately million shares or million of requests that met the eligibility criteria were requested to be redeemed; approximately million of which were fulfilled during the year ended December 31, 2023, and approximately million of which were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and fulfilled in January 2024. Please see the section below titled Suspension and Partial Resumption of DRP and SRP for additional information. Suspension and Partial Resumption of DRP and SRP In connection with a review of liquidity alternatives by the board of directors, on March 7, 2022, the board of directors approved the full suspension of our DRP and SRP. However, on March 16, 2023, the DRP was fully reinstated and the SRP was partially reinstated to allow for redemptions solely sought in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability (as that term is defined in the SRP), confinement to a long-term care facility, or other exigent circumstances. All other redemptions remain suspended at this time.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial data contained elsewhere in this report. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should also be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I. 
 Overview 
 We are a self-managed and fully-integrated self storage real estate investment trust REIT ). Our year end is December 31. As used in this report, we, us, our, and Company refer to SmartStop Self Storage REIT, Inc. and each of our subsidiaries. 
 We focus on the acquisition, ownership, and operation of self storage properties located primarily within the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, throughout the United States and Canada. Based on the Inside Self Storage Top-Operators List ranking for 2024, and after accounting for recent market transactions, we are the 10th largest owner and operator of self storage properties in the United States based on number of properties, units, and rentable square footage. As of September 30, 2024, our wholly-owned portfolio consisted of 157 operating self storage properties diversified across 19 states and Canada comprising approximately 106,300 units and 12.2 million net rentable square feet. Additionally, we owned a 50 equity interest in eleven unconsolidated real estate ventures located in Canada, which included ten operating self storage properties. Further, through our Managed REIT Platform (as defined below), we serve as the sponsor of Strategic Storage Trust VI, Inc., a publicly-registered non-traded REIT SST VI ), and Strategic Storage Growth Trust III, Inc., a private REIT SSGT III and together with SST VI and any future sponsored REITs, the Managed REITs ), and manage one additional self storage property, all of which pay us fees to manage these programs and manage their 35 operating self storage properties (as of September 30, 2024). 
 Our primary business model is focused on owning and operating high quality self storage properties in high growth markets in the United States and Canada. We finance our portfolio through a diverse capital strategy which includes cash generated from operations, borrowings under our syndicated revolving line of credit, secured debt financing, equity offerings and joint ventures. Our business model is designed to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow in order to maximize long-term stockholder value at acceptable levels of risk. We execute our organic growth strategy by pursuing revenue-optimizing and expense-minimizing opportunities in the operations of our existing portfolio. We execute our external growth strategy by developing, redeveloping, acquiring and managing self storage facilities in the United States and Canada both internally and through our Managed REITs, and we look to acquire properties that are physically stabilized, recently developed, in various stages of lease up or at certificate of occupancy. We seek to acquire undermanaged facilities that are not operated by institutional operators, where we can implement our proprietary management and technology to maximize net operating income. 
 As discussed herein, we, through our subsidiaries, currently serve as the sponsor of SST VI and SSGT III. We also served as the sponsor of Strategic Storage Trust IV, Inc., a public non-traded REIT SST IV ), through March 17, 2021, and Strategic Storage Growth Trust II, Inc., a private REIT SSGT II ), through June 1, 2022. Prior to March 17, 2021 and June 1, 2022, SST IV and SSGT II, respectively, were also included in the Managed REITs. We operate the properties owned by the Managed REITs, which together with one other self storage property we manage consist of, as of September 30, 2024, 35 operating properties and approximately 27,500 units and approximately 3.0 million rentable square feet. In addition, we have the internal capability to originate, structure and manage additional self storage investment programs (the Managed REIT Platform which would be sponsored by SmartStop REIT Advisors, LLC SRA ), our indirect subsidiary. We generate asset management fees, property management fees, acquisition fees, and other fees and also receive substantially all of the tenant protection program revenue earned by our Managed REITs. For the property management and advisory services that we provide, we are reimbursed for certain expenses that otherwise helps to offset our net operating expense burden.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have established accounting policies which conform to generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Following is a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in setting accounting policies that we consider critical in the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of GAAP may have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance, or on the comparability of such information to amounts reported for other periods, because of the subjectivity and judgment required to account for highly uncertain items or the susceptibility of such items to change. These estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and our reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period covered by this report. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied or different amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses would have been recorded, thus resulting in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may use different estimates and assumptions that may impact the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations to those companies. 
 We believe that our critical accounting policies include the following: real estate acquisition valuation; the evaluation of whether any of our long-lived assets have been impaired; the valuation of goodwill and related impairment considerations, the valuation of our trademarks and related impairment considerations, the determination of the useful lives of our long-lived assets; and the evaluation of the consolidation of our interests in joint ventures. The following discussion of these policies supplements, but does not supplant the description of our significant accounting policies, as contained in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report, and is intended to present our analysis of the uncertainties involved in arriving upon and applying each policy. 
 Real Estate Acquisition Valuation 
 We account for asset acquisitions in accordance with GAAP which requires that we allocate the purchase price of a property to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. This guidance requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, which requires the use of significant unobservable inputs as of the acquisition date. 
 The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings is determined as if vacant. Because we believe that substantially all of the leases in place at properties we will acquire will be at market rates, as the majority of the leases are month-to-month contracts, we do not expect to allocate any portion of the purchase prices to above or below market leases. We also consider whether in-place, market leases represent an intangible asset. Acquisitions of portfolios of facilities are allocated to the individual facilities based upon an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual facility along with current and projected occupancy and rental rate levels or appraised values, if available. 
 Our allocations of purchase prices are based on certain significant estimates and assumptions, variations in such estimates and assumptions could result in a materially different presentation of the consolidated financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Real Property Assets Valuation 
 We evaluate our real property assets for impairment based on events and changes in circumstances that may arise in the future and that may impact the carrying amounts of such assets. When indicators of potential impairment are present, we will assess the recoverability of the particular asset by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be recovered, through an evaluation of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. This evaluation is based on a number of estimates and assumptions, such as, but not limited to, comparative sales, estimated cash flow, and other similar valuation techniques. Based on this evaluation, if the expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we will adjust the value of the real property asset and recognize an impairment loss. Our evaluation of the impairment of real property assets could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as the amount of impairment loss, if any, recognized may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 65 

Intangible Assets Valuation 
 In connection with the acquisition of the self storage advisory, asset management and property management businesses and certain joint venture interests of Strategic Asset Management I, LLC (f/k/a SmartStop Asset Management, LLC), our former sponsor SAM ), along with certain other assets of SAM (collectively, the Self Administration Transaction ), we allocated a portion of the consideration to the contracts that we acquired related to the Managed REITs and the customer relationships related to our tenant insurance, tenant protection plans or similar programs (the Tenant Protection Programs ). For these intangibles, we are amortizing such amounts on a straight-line basis over the estimated benefit period of the contracts and customer relationships. We evaluate these intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In such an event, an impairment charge is recognized and the intangible asset is marked down to its fair value. 
 Goodwill Valuation 
 Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, as applicable, and is not amortized. We perform an annual qualitative impairment assessment as of December 31 for goodwill; between annual tests we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be fully recoverable. If circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, we perform a quantitative impairment test of goodwill to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge will be recognized. No impairment charges were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Trademarks Valuation 
 Trademarks are based on the value of our brands. Trademarks are valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks, we would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in return for the right to use their name. By virtue of this asset, we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of our ownership of the brand name. 
 We qualitatively evaluate whether any triggering events or changes in circumstances have occurred subsequent to our annual impairment test that would indicate an impairment condition may exist. If any change in circumstance or triggering event occurs, and results in a significant impact to our revenue and profitability projections, or any significant assumption in our valuation methods is adversely impacted, the impact could result in a material impairment charge in the future. 
 Estimated Useful Lives of Real Property Assets 
 We assess the useful lives of the assets underlying our properties based upon a subjective determination of the period of future benefit for each asset. We record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon the estimated useful lives we determine. Our determinations of the useful lives of the assets could result in a materially different presentation of the consolidated financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as such determinations, and the corresponding amount of depreciation expense, may vary dramatically based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 Consolidation Considerations 
 Current accounting guidance provides a framework for identifying a variable interest entity VIE and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. In general, a VIE is an entity or other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3) has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. Generally, a VIE should be consolidated if a party with an ownership, contractual, or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable interest holder) has the power to direct the VIE s most significant activities and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. A variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE s assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interest at fair value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. 
 66 

We evaluate the consolidation of our investments in VIE's in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. This evaluation requires us to determine whether we have a controlling interest in a VIE through a means other than voting rights, and, if so, such VIE may be required to be consolidated in our financial statements. Our evaluation of our VIE's under such accounting guidance could result in a materially different presentation of the financial statements or materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements, as the VIE's included in our consolidated financial statements may vary based on the estimates and assumptions we use. 
 REIT Qualification 
 We made an election under Section 856(c) of the Code to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. By qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that will enable us to continue to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to operate as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 Current Market and Economic Conditions 
 Our rental revenue and operating results depend significantly on the demand for self storage space. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late March 2020, the broader shift of people working from home, elevated migration patterns and strength in the housing market helped drive growth in self storage demand, which generally contributed to our results since the onset of COVID-19, and through calendar year 2022. In addition to the sector's numerous historical demand drivers, one demand driver that developed and has continued as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is the trend towards working from home, or a hybrid work environment. While the work from home environment remains elevated over pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, this trend began to wane in 2023, which we believe led to elevated move-outs. As a result, occupancy, same-store growth and overall results began normalizing. 
 Further, the broader economy has been experiencing elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates, tightening monetary and fiscal policies and a slowdown in home sales and population mobility. This could result in less discretionary spending, weakening consumer balance sheets and reduced demand for self storage. Additionally, a prolonged period of elevated inflation and/or higher interest rates could result in a further contraction of self storage demand. However, demand for the self storage sector is dynamic with drivers that function in a multitude of economic environments, both cyclically and counter-cyclically. Demand for self storage tends to be needs-based, with numerous factors that lead customers to renting and maintaining storage units. Additionally, the broader interest rate and inflationary environment has moderated since the beginning of 2024. These factors could lead to increasing levels of population mobility, specifically amongst single family home buyers and sellers, which could increase demand for self storage. Certain property operating expenses have experienced elevated pressures to date, namely property insurance, property taxes and payroll have seen above average increases, primarily due to inflation and natural disasters. As a result, we have experienced a year-over-year decrease in gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the first three quarters of 2024. 
 In 2022, the Federal Reserve began increasing its targeted range for the federal funds rate, leading to increased interest rates. This approach to monetary policy was mirrored by other central banks across the world, to similar effect. We currently have fixed or capped interest rates of varying durations for the majority of our loans, either directly or indirectly through our use of interest rate hedges. The rise in overall interest rates has caused an increase in our variable rate borrowing costs and our overall cost of capital, resulting in an increase in net interest expense. Capitalization rates on acquisitions did not increase at the same magnitude as interest rates increased in 2022 and 2023, which limited our ability make accretive acquisitions of self storage properties. However, with anticipation of the Federal Reserve lowering its target range for the federal funds rate, interest rates across the curve began to decrease in the first half of 2024. In September of 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered its targeted range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. In November 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered its targeted range for the federal funds rate by an additional 25 basis points. 
 Recent Hurricane Activity 
 Hurricane Helene caused record flooding in late September 2024 in Asheville, North Carolina. Before, during and after the storm, we prioritized the safety and security of our employees, customers and properties. For all 14 of our wholly-owned properties in the Asheville area, except for one, the impact was generally limited to wind, wind-blown debris and downed trees and branches, with minimal damage sustained. These properties were temporarily closed, but resumed operations shortly after the storm. 
 67 

We sustained significant damage at one of our properties which was severely flooded. As a result of the flooding and related damage, we recorded a net casualty loss related to the flooded property of approximately 4.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to write-off the carrying value. We expect to rebuild and therefore we believe it is probable that we will receive insurance proceeds to offset the casualty loss and have recorded a receivable related to our pending insurance claims. Consequently the casualty loss was completely offset in our consolidated statements of operations by such recovery. Any amount of insurance recovery related to the property damage in excess of the casualty loss incurred is considered a gain contingency, and will be recognized upon final settlement of the claims. Additionally, we accrued 0.5 million related to other losses, which was included in Property operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Since Hurricane Helene passed, we have worked towards quickly re-opening our properties, except the flooded Asheville property, to normal operating conditions, with our efforts focused on debris cleanup and removal and other more minor repairs. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, Hurricane Milton also made landfall in Florida and the majority of our Florida properties were temporarily closed but resumed operations shortly after the storm. Damages were generally minor and limited to wind, downed fences, wind-blown debris and downed trees and branches. 
 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 We derive revenues principally from: (i) rents received from our self storage tenant leases; (ii) fees generated from our Managed REITs; (iii) our Tenant Protection Programs; and (iv) sales of packing and storage-related supplies at our storage facilities. Therefore, our operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing tenants and lease our available self storage units to new tenants, while maintaining and, where possible, increasing the prices for our self storage units. 
 Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental revenues and operating expenses of our facilities. Development of any new self storage facilities would intensify competition of self storage operators in markets in which we operate. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we wholly-owned 157 and 153 operating self storage facilities, respectively. Our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included full quarter results for 155 self storage facilities. Our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included full quarter results for 153 self storage facilities. Operating results in future periods will depend on the results of operations of these properties and of the real estate properties that we may acquire in the future. 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total Self Storage Revenues 
 Total self storage related revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 55.4 million and 54.8 million, respectively. The increase in total self storage revenues of approximately 0.6 million, or approximately 1.1 , is primarily attributable to an increase in non same-store revenues of approximately 0.6 million, largely as a result of three property acquisitions during 2024. 
 We expect self storage revenues to primarily fluctuate based on the performance of our same-store pool, which will be influenced by the overall economic environment and increases in self storage supply, amongst other things. 
 Managed REIT Platform Revenues 
 Managed REIT Platform revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 2.9 million and 2.5 million, respectively. The increase in Managed REIT Platform revenues of approximately 0.4 million is primarily attributable to increased property management fees of approximately 0.2 million and increased Tenant Protection Program fees at our Managed REITs' properties of approximately 0.1 million as compared to the same period in the prior year. Such increases in Managed REIT Platform revenues were partially offset as compared to the prior year by the effect of sponsor funding reductions recorded to revenue only in the current year. 
 We expect Managed REIT Platform Revenue to fluctuate commensurate with our Managed REITs' increase in operations and assets under management, as well as additional reductions recorded to such revenue in connection with the 
 68 

Sponsor Funding Agreement as SST VI continues to sell shares in its public offering and such reductions increase commensurately. 
 Reimbursable Costs from Managed REITs 
 Reimbursable costs from Managed REITs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.9 million and 1.4 million, respectively. Such revenues consist of costs incurred by us as we provide property management and advisory services to the Managed REITs, which are reimbursed by the Managed REITs, pursuant to our related contracts with the Managed REITs. The increase in reimbursable costs from Managed REITs is primarily related to the growth in the Managed REITs' assets under management. We expect reimbursable costs from Managed REITs to increase in future periods as a result of additional acquisitions by our Managed REITs. We further expect reimbursable costs from Managed REITs to generally fluctuate commensurate with our Managed REITs' increase in operations as we receive reimbursement for providing such services. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Property operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 18.2 million (or 33 of self storage revenue) and 16.3 million (or 30 of self storage revenue), respectively. Property operating expenses include the costs to operate our facilities including compensation related expenses, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, and property related marketing. The increase in property operating expenses of approximately 1.9 million is largely attributable to increased property operating expenses of approximately 1.0 million related to our non same-store properties and the balance related to increased property insurance costs, payroll costs, repairs and maintenance expenses, and advertising expenses on our same-store properties. We expect property operating expenses to fluctuate commensurate with inflationary pressures and any future acquisitions. 
 Managed REIT Platform Expenses 
 Managed REIT Platform expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.1 million and 1.3 million, respectively. Such expenses primarily consisted of expenses related to non-reimbursable costs associated with the operation of the Managed REIT Platform incurred directly and indirectly through the Administrative Services Agreement (as discussed in Note 10 Related Party Transactions, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report). We expect Managed REIT Platform expenses to fluctuate in future periods commensurate with our level of activity related to the Managed REITs. 
 Reimbursable Costs from Managed REITs 
 Reimbursable costs from Managed REITs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.9 million and 1.4 million, respectively. Such expenses consist of costs incurred by us as we provide property management and advisory services to the Managed REITs, which are reimbursed by the Managed REITs, pursuant to our related contracts with the Managed REITs. The increase in reimbursable costs from Managed REITs is primarily related to the growth in the Managed REITs' assets under management. We expect reimbursable costs from the Managed REITs to fluctuate commensurate with our Managed REITs' increase in operations as we receive reimbursement for providing such services. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 7.2 million and 6.3 million, respectively. Such expenses consist primarily of compensation related costs, marketing related costs, legal expenses, accounting expenses, transfer agent fees, directors and officers insurance expense and board of directors related costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased legal expenses, marketing related expenses, and compensation related costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues over time. 
 69 

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 14.1 million and 15.2 million, respectively. Depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation on the buildings and site improvements at our properties. Amortization expense consists of the amortization of our in place lease intangible assets resulting from our self storage acquisitions and amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the Self Administration Transaction. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily attributable to the intangible amortization expense related to our in place lease intangible assets recorded in connection with the SSGT II Merger which became fully amortized in November 2023. 
 Acquisition Expenses 
 Acquisition expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 38,000 and 76,000, respectively. These acquisition expenses were incurred prior to acquisitions becoming probable in accordance with our capitalization policy. 
 Equity in earnings (losses) from investments in joint ventures 
 Losses from our equity method investments in our joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0.4 million and 0.3 million, respectively. Losses from our equity method investments in our joint ventures consists of our allocation of earnings and losses from our joint ventures with SmartCentres. 
 Equity in earnings (losses) from investments in Managed REITs 
 Losses from our equity method investments in the Managed REITs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 0.2 million and 0.4 million, respectively. Losses from our equity method investments in the Managed REITs consists primarily of our allocation of earnings and losses from our investments in SST VI and SSGT III. 
 Other, Net 
 Other, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 2.0 million and 0.3 million of expense, respectively. Other, net consists primarily of certain state tax expenses, foreign currency fluctuations, changes in value related to our foreign currency and interest rate hedges not designated for hedge accounting, and other miscellaneous items. The unfavorable variance of approximately 1.7 million is primarily due to unfavorable fair value adjustments associated with our SOFR interest rate hedges not designated for hedge accounting during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 1.0 million and 0.7 million, respectively. Interest income includes interest income on loans to the Managed REITs, accretion of financing fee revenues associated with such loans, and interest earned on cash held at financial institutions. We expect interest income from the Managed REITs to fluctuate commensurate with their borrowings, as well as changes to benchmark interest rates on such borrowings. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 19.1 million and 15.9 million, respectively. Interest expense includes interest expense on our debt, accretion of fair market value adjustments of our debt, amortization of debt issuance costs, and the impact of our interest rate derivatives designated for hedge accounting. The increase of approximately 3.2 million as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to increased borrowings, increases to our net effective interest rates, as well as increased amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately 0.5 million primarily due to increased debt issuance costs associated with the 2024 Credit Facility. The increase in net effective interest rates as compared to the same period in the prior year is attributable to a beneficial interest rate hedge which capped SOFR at 2.0 for 125 million of our debt during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which expired on June 28, 2024 and did not provide any benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect interest expense to fluctuate in future periods commensurate with our future debt levels and fluctuations in interest rates. 
 70 

Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
 Income tax (expense) benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 0.4 million of expense and 1.1 million of benefit, respectively. Income tax consists primarily of state, federal, and Canadian income tax. The change is primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance during the three months ended September 30, 2023 on certain of our deferred tax assets related to our non-capital losses at some of our Canadian properties, resulting in a net income tax benefit for such period. We expect our income tax expense to increase in future periods primarily related to our operations in Canada. 
 Same-Store Facility Results - three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 We consider the data below to be meaningful as this allows for the comparison of results without the effects of acquisition, lease up, or development activity. The following table sets forth operating data for our same-store facilities (stabilized and comparable properties that have been included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2023, excluding five other properties) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands unless otherwise noted).

(2) Property operating expenses excludes Tenant Protection Program related expense. Please see the reconciliation of net operating income to net income (loss) below for the full detail of adjustments to reconcile net operating income to net income (loss). 

(3) Of the total rentable square feet, parking represented approximately 1,040,000 square feet as of September 30, 2024 and approximately 1,017,000 square feet as 2023, respectively. On a same-store basis, parking represented approximately 960,000 square feet. Amount not in thousands. 

(4) Determined by dividing the sum of the month-end occupied square feet for the applicable group of facilities for each applicable period by the sum of their month-end rentable square feet for the period. 

(5) Determined by dividing the aggregate realized rental income for each applicable period by the aggregate of the month-end occupied square feet for the period. Properties are included in the respective calculations in their first full month of operations, as appropriate. We have excluded the realized rental revenue and occupied square feet related to parking herein for the purpose of calculating annualized rent per occupied square foot. Amount not in thousands. 

Our same-store revenue decreased by approximately 0.2 million, or approximately 0.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an approximately 0.7 decrease in average occupancy, partially offset by an approximately 0.5 increase in annualized rent per occupied square foot. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to increased property insurance costs, payroll costs, repairs and maintenance expenses, and advertising expenses.

 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total Self Storage Revenues 
 Total self storage related revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 163.0 million and 162.1 million, respectively. The increase in total self storage revenues of approximately 0.9 million, or approximately 0.6 , is primarily attributable to an increase in non same-store revenues of approximately 1.0 million, largely as a result of three property acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We expect self storage revenues to primarily fluctuate based on the performance of our same-store pool, which will be influenced by the overall economic environment and increases in self storage supply, amongst other things. 
 Managed REIT Platform Revenues 
 Managed REIT Platform revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 8.3 million and 9.1 million, respectively. The decrease in Managed REIT Platform revenues of approximately 0.8 million is primarily attributable to decreased acquisition fees as compared to the same period in the prior year. We earned approximately 1.9 million in acquisition fees from SST VI in June 2023 as a result of a multi-property portfolio acquisition. Managed REIT Platform revenues were also reduced as compared to the prior year to a lesser extent by the effect of sponsor funding reductions recorded to revenue only in the current year. Such decreases in Managed REIT Platform revenues were partially offset by increased Tenant Protection Program fees, property management and asset management fees as a result of increased assets under management. 
 We expect Managed REIT Platform Revenue to fluctuate commensurate with our Managed REITs' increase in operations and assets under management, as well as additional reductions recorded to such revenue in connection with the 
 72 

Sponsor Funding Agreement as SST VI continues to sell shares in its public offering and such reductions increase commensurately. 
 Reimbursable Costs from Managed REITs 
 Reimbursable costs from Managed REITs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 5.0 million and 4.2 million, respectively. Such revenues consist of costs incurred by us as we provide property management and advisory services to the Managed REITs, which are reimbursed by the Managed REITs, pursuant to our related contracts with the Managed REITs. The increase in reimbursable costs from Managed REITs is primarily related to the growth in the Managed REITs' assets under management. We expect reimbursable costs from Managed REITs to increase in future periods as a result of additional acquisitions by our Managed REITs. We further expect reimbursable costs from Managed REITs to generally fluctuate commensurate with our Managed REITs' increase in operations as we receive reimbursement for providing such services. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Property operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 53.3 million (or 33 of self storage revenue) and 49.3 million (or 30 of self storage revenue), respectively. Property operating expenses include the costs to operate our facilities including compensation related expenses, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, and property related marketing. The increase in property operating expenses of approximately 4.0 million is largely attributable to increased property operating expenses of approximately 1.5 million related to our non same-store properties and the balance related to increased insurance costs, payroll costs, repairs and maintenance expenses, and advertising expenses on our same-store properties. We expect property operating expenses to fluctuate commensurate with inflationary pressures and any future acquisitions. 
 Managed REIT Platform Expenses 
 Managed REIT Platform expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 2.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively. Such expenses primarily consisted of expenses related to non-reimbursable costs associated with the operation of the Managed REIT Platform incurred directly and indirectly through the Administrative Services Agreement (as discussed in Note 10 Related Party Transactions, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report). The increase in Managed REIT Platform Expenses is primarily related to growth in the Managed REITs' assets under management. We expect Managed REIT Platform expenses to fluctuate in future periods commensurate with our level of activity related to the Managed REITs. 
 Reimbursable Costs from Managed REITs 
 Reimbursable costs from Managed REITs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 5.0 million and 4.2 million, respectively. Such expenses consist of costs incurred by us as we provide property management and advisory services to the Managed REITs, which are reimbursed by the Managed REITs, pursuant to our related contracts with the Managed REITs. The increase in reimbursable costs from Managed REITs is primarily related to the growth in the Managed REITs' assets under management. We expect reimbursable costs from the Managed REITs to fluctuate commensurate with our Managed REITs' increase in operations as we receive reimbursement for providing such services. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 22.4 million and 20.0 million, respectively. Such expenses consist primarily of compensation related costs, marketing related costs, legal expenses, accounting expenses, transfer agent fees, directors and officers insurance expense and board of directors related costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded expenses of approximately 0.3 million and none, respectively, related to our filing of an amendment to our registration statement on Form S-11 and related costs in pursuit of a potential offering of our common stock. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased legal expenses, marketing related expenses, and compensation related costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues over time. 
 73 

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately	 41.5 million and 45.6 million, respectively. Depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation on the buildings and site improvements at our properties. Amortization expense consists of the amortization of our in place lease intangible assets resulting from our self storage acquisitions and amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the Self Administration Transaction. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily attributable to the intangible amortization expense related to our in place lease intangible assets recorded in connection with the SSGT II Merger which became fully amortized in November 2023. 
 Acquisition Expenses 
 Acquisition expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 121,000 and 118,000, respectively. These acquisition expenses were incurred prior to acquisitions becoming probable in accordance with our capitalization policy. 
 Equity in earnings (losses) from investments in joint ventures 
 Losses from our equity method investments in our joint ventures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.1 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Losses from our equity method investments in our joint ventures consists of our allocation of earnings and losses from our joint ventures with SmartCentres. 
 Equity in earnings (losses) from investments in Managed REITs 
 Losses from our equity method investments in the Managed REITs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 1.0 million and 0.9 million, respectively. Losses from our equity method investments in the Managed REITs consists primarily of our allocation of earnings and losses from our investments in SST VI and SSGT III. 
 Other, Net 
 Other, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 2.9 million and 0.2 million of expense, respectively. Other, net consists primarily of certain state tax expenses, foreign currency fluctuations, changes in value related to our foreign currency and interest rate hedges not designated for hedge accounting, and other miscellaneous items. The unfavorable variance of approximately 2.7 million is primarily due to unfavorable fair value adjustments associated with our SOFR interest rate hedges not designated for hedge accounting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 2.4 million and 2.5 million, respectively. Interest income includes interest income on loans to the Managed REITs, accretion of financing fee revenues associated with such loans, and interest earned on cash held at financial institutions. We expect interest income from the Managed REITs to fluctuate commensurate with their borrowings, as well as changes to benchmark interest rates on such borrowings. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 52.9 million and 45.5 million, respectively. Interest expense includes interest expense on our debt, accretion of fair market value adjustments of our debt, amortization of debt issuance costs, and the impact of our interest rate derivatives designated for hedge accounting. The increase of approximately 7.4 million as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to increased borrowings, increases to our net effective interest rates, as well as increased amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately 0.9 million primarily due to increased debt issuance costs associated with the 2024 Credit Facility. The increase in net effective interest rates as compared to the same period in the prior year is attributable to two beneficial interest rate hedges which capped SOFR at 1.75 and 2.0 for 125 million of our debt, each, which expired on June 30, 2023 and June 28, 2024, respectively. We expect interest expense to fluctuate in future periods commensurate with our future debt levels and fluctuations in net effective interest rates. 
 74 

Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
 Loss on debt extinguishment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 0.5 million, and none, respectively. Loss on debt extinguishment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to certain unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2021 Credit Facility which were expensed in connection with the execution of the new 2024 Credit Facility. Please see Note 5 Debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report for additional information. 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
 Income tax (expense) benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 1.1 million of expense and 0.9 million of benefit, respectively. Income tax consists primarily of state, federal, and Canadian income tax. The change is primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 on certain of our deferred tax assets related to our non-capital losses at some of our Canadian properties, resulting in a net income tax benefit for such period. We expect our income tax expense to increase in future periods primarily related to our operations in Canada. 
 Same-Store Facility Results - nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 We consider the data below to be meaningful as this allows for the comparison of results without the effects of acquisition, lease up, or development activity. The following table sets forth operating data for our same-store facilities (stabilized and comparable properties that have been included in the consolidated results of operations since January 1, 2023, excluding five other properties) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands unless otherwise noted).

(3) Of the total rentable square feet, parking represented approximately 1,040,000 square feet as of September 30, 2024 and approximately 1,017,000 square feet as 2023, respectively. On a same-store basis, parking represented approximately 960,000 square feet. Amount not in thousands. 

(4) Determined by dividing the sum of the month-end occupied square feet for the applicable group of facilities for each applicable period by the sum of their month-end rentable square feet for the period. 

(5) Determined by dividing the aggregate realized rental income for each applicable period by the aggregate of the month-end occupied square feet for the period. Properties are included in the respective calculations in their first full month of operations, as appropriate. We have excluded the realized rental revenue and occupied square feet related to parking herein for the purpose of calculating annualized rent per occupied square foot. Amount not in thousands.

Our same-store revenue decreased by approximately 0.4 million, or approximately 0.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an approximately 0.7 decrease in average occupancy, partially offset by an approximately 0.5 increase in annualized rent per occupied square foot. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to increased property insurance costs, payroll costs, repairs and maintenance expenses, and advertising expenses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Funds from Operations 
 Funds from operations FFO ), is a non-GAAP financial metric promulgated by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) that we believe is an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect our operating performance. We define FFO consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the board of governors of NAREIT, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related asset impairment write downs, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Additionally, gains and losses from change in control are excluded from the determination of FFO. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above. 
 FFO, as Adjusted 
 We use FFO, as adjusted, as an additional non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our operating performance. FFO, as adjusted, provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management. In addition, FFO, as adjusted, is a measure used among our peer group, which includes publicly traded REITs. Further, we believe FFO, as adjusted, is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies. 
 In determining FFO, as adjusted, we make further adjustments to the NAREIT computation of FFO to exclude the effects of non-real estate related asset impairments and intangible amortization, acquisition related costs, other write-offs incurred in connection with acquisitions, contingent earnout expenses, accretion of fair value of debt adjustments, amortization of debt issuance costs, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt, adjustments of deferred tax assets and liabilities, realized and unrealized gains/losses on foreign exchange transactions, gains/losses on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives not designated for hedge accounting, and other select non-recurring income or expense items which we believe are not indicative of our overall long-term operating performance. We exclude these items from GAAP net income (loss) to arrive at FFO, as adjusted, as they are not the primary drivers in our decision-making process and excluding these items provides investors a view of our continuing operating portfolio performance over time, which in any respective period may experience fluctuations in such acquisition, merger or other similar activities that are not of a long-term operating performance nature. FFO, as adjusted, also reflects adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments. We use FFO, as adjusted, as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals and evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies. 
 Presentation of FFO and FFO, as adjusted, is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs. However, not all REITs calculate FFO and FFO, as adjusted, the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and FFO, as adjusted, are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and FFO, as adjusted, should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance.

(2) These items represent the amortization, accretion, or adjustment of intangible assets, debt issuance costs, or deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 
 (3) This represents acquisition expenses associated with investments in real estate that were incurred prior to the acquisitions becoming probable and therefore not capitalized in accordance with our capitalization policy. 

(4) This represents the mark-to-market adjustment for our derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting and the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives recognized in earnings, as well as changes in foreign currency related to our foreign equity investments not classified as long term. 
 
 (5) Such costs relate to our filing of a registration statement on Form S-11 and our pursuit of a potential offering of our common stock. As this item is non-recurring and not a primary driver in our decision-making process, FFO is adjusted for its effect to arrive at FFO, as adjusted, as a means of determining a comparable sustainable operating performance metric. 
 
 (6) Pursuant to the Sponsor Funding Agreement, SmartStop funds certain costs of SST VI's share sales, and in return 
 receives Series C Units in Strategic Storage Operating Partnership VI, L.P. The excess of the funding over the value of the Series C Units received is accounted for as a reduction of Managed REIT Platform revenues from SST VI over the remaining estimated term of the management contracts with SST VI. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FFO is adjusted for its effect to arrive at FFO, as adjusted, as a means of determining a comparable sustainable operating performance metric. 
 
 (7) The net loss associated with the extinguishment of debt includes prepayment penalties, defeasance costs, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, and other fees incurred. 
 
 (8) Such losses related to Hurricane Helene, which occurred in September 2024. 
 
 (9) Our calculation of FFO, as adjusted was modified beginning in the period ended March 31, 2024, to add back the amortization of debt issuance costs. Accordingly, the prior periods have been presented here based on the current calculation, which differs from what was previously reported for such periods. This modification was made to reflect what management believes is a more appropriate calculation in light of recently completed debt refinancings. 

FFO, as adjusted declined compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the effects of increased interest expense on net income, and to a lesser extent, a reduction in property net operating income. 
 Cash Flows 
 A comparison of cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended 

September 30, 2024 

September 30, 2023

3,488 

(83,789) 

Financing activities 

19,112 

(74,212) 

93,324 

Cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 53.4 million and 68.7 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately 15.3 million. The decrease in cash provided by our operating activities is primarily the result of a decrease of approximately 9.7 million in net income when excluding the impact of non-cash items and unfavorable changes in working capital of approximately 5.6 million as compared to the same period in the prior year. The change in net income was primarily as a result of increased property operating expenses and interest expense. The change in working capital was primarily a result of an increase in Managed REIT receivables, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 79 

Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 80.3 million and cash flows provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately 3.5 million, respectively, a change of approximately 83.8 million. The net increase in cash used in investing activities primarily relates to a net change of approximately 41.5 million in cash flows related to our debt investments in the Managed REITs and a net change of approximately 38.7 million in cash flows related to acquisitions and additions to real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 19.1 million, and cash flows used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately 74.2 million, respectively, a change of approximately 93.3 million. The change in cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to net debt proceeds, inclusive of debt issuance costs, received of approximately 83.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net debt cash outflows of approximately 14.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Short-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity needs consist primarily of our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, Managed REIT Platform expenses, debt service payments, capital expenditures, property acquisitions, property developments and improvements, investments in our Managed REITs, required payments pursuant to our Sponsor Funding Agreement, and distributions to our Series A Convertible Preferred stockholder, limited partners in our Operating Partnership, and our stockholders, as necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. We generally expect that we will meet our short-term liquidity requirements from the combination of existing cash balances and net cash provided from property operations and the Managed REIT Platform and further supported by our 2024 Credit Facility. Alternatively, we may issue additional secured or unsecured financing from banks or other lenders, or we may enter into various other forms of financing. 
 
 In April 2022, we received our initial investment grade credit rating of BBB- from Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. In accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement, we intend to maintain a credit rating on an annual basis. This rating was reaffirmed by Kroll in April 2024. 
 
 Our 2024 Credit Facility contains a borrowing base requirement, which is impacted by treasury yields. Increases to treasury yields could negatively impact our borrowing base calculation and limit our ability to borrow pursuant to the 2024 Credit Facility. Volatility in the debt and equity markets and continued and/or further impact of rising treasury yields, interest rates, inflation and other economic events will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Such events may have an impact on our current liquidity in the short-term. If such events were to occur in the short-term we would expect to take certain steps, including but not limited to refinancing certain of our current loans, and adding additional properties onto our 2024 Credit Facility, each of which we expect would increase our borrowing availability. Moreover, continued uncertainty or deterioration in the debt and equity markets, or continued increases in treasury yields and interest rates, over an extended period of time, could also potentially impact our liquidity over the long-term. If such events were to occur in the long-term, we would expect to take other additional steps, including but not limited to other sources of capital such as proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, issuance of equity instruments, and additional public or private offerings. 
 Distribution Policy and Distributions 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 The shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock rank senior to all other shares of our capital stock, including our common stock, with respect to rights to receive dividends and to participate in distributions or payments upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Dividends payable on each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock accrue daily but are payable quarterly in arrears. Such dividends accrued at a rate equal to 6.25 per annum until October 29, 2024, and accrued at a rate of 7.0 per annum thereafter. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was not redeemed on or prior to the fifth anniversary date of the Initial Closing (October 29, 2024). As such, the dividend rate will continue to increase at an additional 0.75 per annum each year thereafter to a maximum of 9.0 per annum until the tenth anniversary of the Initial Closing, at which time the dividend rate shall increase 0.75 per annum each year thereafter until the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is either converted or repurchased in full. 
 80 

Common Stock Distributions 
 On September 27, 2024, our board of directors declared a distribution rate for the month of October 2024 of approximately 0.0508 per share on the outstanding shares of common stock payable to Class A and Class T stockholders of record of such shares as shown on our books at the close of business on October 31, 2024. Such distributions payable to each stockholder of record will be paid the following month. 
 On October 25, 2024, our board of directors declared a distribution rate for the month of November 2024 of approximately 0.0492 per share on the outstanding shares of common stock payable to Class A and Class T stockholders of record of such shares as shown on our books at the close of business on November 30, 2024. Such distributions payable to each stockholder of record will be paid the following month. 
 Background and History of Common Stock Distributions 
 Since substantially all of our operations are performed indirectly through our Operating Partnership, our ability to pay distributions depends in large part on our Operating Partnership s ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. In the event we do not have enough cash from operations to fund cash distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to fund the distributions. The terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock place certain restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to our common stockholders. In general, we are prohibited from paying distributions to our common stockholders other than regular cash dividends on a basis consistent with past practice and dividends payable in shares of common stock in connection with an initial listing of such shares. Accordingly, we are presently only permitted to pay cash distributions, which may be reinvested in stock pursuant to our DRP, unless otherwise approved by the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Absent the foregoing restrictions, our charter allows our board of directors to authorize payments to stockholders in cash or other assets of the Company or in stock, including in stock of one class payable to holders of stock of another class. 
 We may not be able to pay distributions from our cash flows from operations, in which case distributions may be paid in part from debt or other financing sources. 
 Distributions are paid to our common stockholders based on the record date selected by our board of directors. Such distributions are based on monthly declaration. We expect to continue to regularly pay distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions, or other factors inhibit us from doing so. Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors, which are directed, in substantial part, by its obligation to cause us to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code. Absent the restrictions noted above, our board of directors may increase, decrease or eliminate the distribution rate that is being paid on our common stock at any time. Distributions are made on all classes of our common stock at the same time. The funds that are available for distribution may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: 
 our operating and interest expenses; 

our ability to keep our properties occupied; 

our ability to maintain or increase rental rates; 

increases to our property operating expenses 

construction defects or capital improvements; 

capital expenditures and reserves for such expenditures; 

the issuance of additional shares; 

financings and refinancings; and 

dividends with respect to the outstanding shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

From our inception through September 30, 2024, we paid cumulative distributions of approximately 460.1 million, of which approximately 362.3 million were paid to common stockholders, as compared to cumulative FFO (attributable to common stockholders) of approximately 142.5 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid distributions of approximately 59.9 million, of which approximately 43.7 million were paid to common stockholders, as compared to FFO (attributable to common stockholders) of approximately 22.6 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid distributions of approximately 59.9 million, of which approximately 43.8 million were paid to common stockholders, as compared to FFO (attributable to common stockholders) of approximately 39.3 million. 
 The payment of distributions from sources other than FFO may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
 We must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year in order to meet the requirements for being treated as a REIT under the Code. Our directors may authorize distributions in excess of this percentage as they deem appropriate. Because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our income earned in that particular distribution period, but may be made in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and may be made in advance of actual receipt of funds in an attempt to make distributions relatively uniform. To allow for such differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses, and the effect of required debt payments, among other things, we could be required to borrow funds from third parties on a short-term basis, issue new securities, or sell assets to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We are not prohibited from undertaking such activities by our charter, bylaws or investment policies, and we may use an unlimited amount from any source to pay our distributions. These methods of obtaining funding could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs and decreasing available cash, which could reduce the value of our stockholders investment in our shares. In addition, such distributions may constitute a return of investors capital. 
 We may not be able to pay distributions from our cash flows from operations, in which case distributions may be paid in part from available funds or from debt financing and pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The payment of distributions from sources other than cash flows from operations may reduce the amount of proceeds available for investment and operations or cause us to incur additional interest expense as a result of borrowed funds. 
 Over the long-term, we expect that a greater percentage of our distributions will be paid from cash flows from operations. However, our operating performance cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including our ability to raise and invest capital at favorable yields, the financial performance of our investments in the current real estate and financial environment and the types and mix of investments in our portfolio. As a result, future distributions declared and paid may exceed cash flow from operations. 
 82 

Indebtedness 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net debt was approximately 1,180 million, which included approximately 519 million in fixed rate debt and approximately 664 million in variable rate debt, less approximately 3.3 million in net debt issuance costs. See Note 5 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our indebtedness. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 70.0 million CAD or approximately 51.8 million in USD, was outstanding on the RBC JV Term Loan, approximately 46.0 million CAD or approximately 34.0 million in USD, was outstanding on the RBC JV Term Loan II, and approximately 17.3 million CAD or approximately 12.8 million in USD was outstanding on the SmartCentres Financing. See Note 4 Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for additional information. 
 Long-Term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 On a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, Managed REIT Platform expenses, debt service payments, capital expenditures, property acquisitions, investments in our Managed REITs, required payments pursuant to the Sponsor Funding Agreement, and distributions to our Series A Convertible Preferred stockholder, limited partners in our Operating Partnership, and our stockholders, as necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. 
 Long-term potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, issuance of equity instruments, undistributed funds from operations, and additional public or private offerings. To the extent we are not able to secure requisite financing in the form of a credit facility or other debt, we will be dependent upon proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and cash flows from operating activities in order to meet our long-term liquidity requirements and to fund our distributions. 
 Our material cash requirements from contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our debt obligations. The expected timing of those outstanding principal payments are shown in the table below. The information in this section should be read in conjunction with Note 5 Debt, and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this report.

 Through September 30, 2024, we have incurred approximately 8.7 million in connection with the Sponsor Funding Agreement, representing approximately 928,000 subordinated units. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred approximately 0.6 million and 1.8 million, respectively, of which approximately 0.2 million was accrued as a payable pursuant to the Sponsor Funding Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the maximum remaining commitment of SRA pursuant to the Sponsor Funding Agreement is approximately 61.9 million if SST VI were to sell the maximum amount under its current offering of 1.0 billion. 
 See Note 10 Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our obligations under these agreements. 
 For cash requirements related to potential acquisitions currently under contract, please see Note 3 Real Estate Facilities and Note 4 Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subsequent Events 
 Please see Note 14 Subsequent Events of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
 Seasonality 
 We believe that we will experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of our facilities, which we believe will be slightly higher over the summer months due to increased moving activity. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk and to a lesser extent, foreign currency risk. We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and fund acquisition, expansion, and financing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives will be to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net debt was approximately 1,180 million, which included approximately 519 million in fixed rate debt and approximately 664 million in variable rate debt, less approximately 3.3 million in net debt issuance costs. See Note 5 Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our indebtedness. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our net debt was approximately 1,087 million, which included approximately 523 million in fixed rate debt, approximately 569 million in variable rate debt and approximately 0.1 million in net debt discount, and approximately 4.3 million in net debt issuance costs. Our debt instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes. 
 Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable debt. A change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts its fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on variable debt could impact the interest incurred and cash flows and its fair value. If the underlying rate of the related index on our variable rate debt were to increase by 100 basis points, the increase in interest as of September 30, 2024, net of our interest rate derivatives, would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 2.6 million annually. 
 Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure. 
 The following table summarizes annual debt maturities and average interest rates, excluding the impact of our interest rate hedges, on our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

(1) Interest expense for fixed rate debt was calculated based upon the contractual rate and the interest expense on variable rate debt was calculated based on the rate in effect on September 30, 2024, excluding the impact of interest rate derivatives. (See Note 5 Debt for additional information.) Debt denominated in foreign currency has been converted based on the rate in effect as of September 30, 2024. 
 Currently, our only foreign exchange rate risk comes from our Canadian properties and CAD. Our existing foreign currency hedges mitigate most of our foreign currency exposure of our net CAD denominated investments; however, we generate all of our revenues and expend essentially all of our operating expenses and third party CAD-denominated debt

service costs related to our Canadian Properties in CAD. As a result of fluctuations in currency exchange, our cash flows and results of operations could be affected.
