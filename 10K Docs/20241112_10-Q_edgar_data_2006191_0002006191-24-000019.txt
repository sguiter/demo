million for a members interest in a newly formed limited liability company, CP LG Library Holdings, LLC CP LG ), with the Company designated as the managing member of CP LG. CP LG used the funds received from the Company, along with funds invested by the member, to acquire a library of films for approximately million. Also on June 5, 2024, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with CP LG to distribute the titles in the acquired library. The purchase included the film library (of which million of the purchase price was allocated to investment in film and television programs for the film library), accounts receivable and certain liabilities associated with the film library, most notably participations and residuals liabilities. 
 The Company determined that CP LG is a variable interest entity VIE for which it is the primary beneficiary and is consolidated under the applicable accounting guidance as the Company has the power to direct the significant activities and the right to receive benefits and obligation to absorb losses of CP LG. The Company concluded that the acquired library and related assets and liabilities was not a business and therefore, accounted for the acquisition as an initial consolidation of a VIE that is not a business under the applicable accounting guidance. There was gain or loss recognized upon initial consolidation of the VIE as the sum of the fair value of the consideration paid and noncontrolling interest equaled the fair value of the net assets on the acquisition date. See Note 10 for the noncontrolling interest recorded related to CP LG. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of CP LG totaling million (which is primarily comprised of investment in film and television programs) and million, respectively. The assets and liabilities of CP LG primarily consist of accounts receivable, investment in film and television programs, and participations and residuals. 
 
 eOne Acquisition 
 On December 27, 2023, Lionsgate and its subsidiaries, Lions Gate Entertainment Inc., a Delaware corporation LGEI ), and Lions Gate International Motion Pictures S. .r.l., a Luxembourg soci t responsabilit limit e LGIMP and, with the Company and LGEI, collectively the Buyers ), completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the companies constituting the Entertainment One television and film eOne business from Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation Hasbro ), pursuant to that certain Equity Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement dated August 3, 2023. The aggregate cash purchase price was initially approximately million and subsequently adjusted to million upon the settlement of certain working capital items pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The final purchase price is subject to further adjustment based on the settlement of certain amounts held back pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The acquisition of eOne, a film and television production and distribution company, builds the Company's film and television library, strengthens the Company's scripted and unscripted television business, and continues to expand the Company's presence in Canada and the U.K. 
 The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with the financial results of eOne included in the Company's consolidated results from December 27, 2023. 
 Allocation of Purchase Consideration. The Company has made a preliminary estimate of the allocation of the preliminary purchase price of eOne to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value. The Company is still evaluating the fair value of film and television programs and libraries, accounts receivable, participations and residuals liabilities and income taxes, in addition to ensuring all other assets and liabilities have been identified and recorded. The Company has estimated the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information currently available and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information pertaining to events or circumstances present at December 27, 2023 becomes available and final appraisals and analysis are completed. The Company will reflect measurement period adjustments, in the period in which the adjustments occur, and the Company will finalize its accounting for the acquisition within one year from December 27, 2023 (see Note 6 for measurement period adjustments recorded through September 30, 2024). A change in the fair value of the net assets may change the amount recognized to goodwill. If the final fair value estimates and tax adjustments related to the net assets acquired decrease from their preliminary estimates, the amount of goodwill will increase and if the final fair value estimates and tax adjustments related to the net assets acquired increase from their preliminary estimates, the amount of goodwill will decrease and may result in a gain on purchase. In addition, the final fair value estimates related to the net assets acquired could impact the amount of amortization expense recorded associated with amounts allocated to film and television programs and other intangible assets. The preliminary goodwill amount is reflected in the table below, and arises from the opportunity for strengthening our global distribution infrastructure and enhanced positioning for motion picture and television projects and selling opportunities. The goodwill will not be amortized for financial reporting purposes, and will not be deductible for federal tax purposes. The fair value measurements were primarily based on

 Investment in films and television programs includes the preliminary fair value of completed films and television programs which have been produced by eOne or for which eOne has acquired distribution rights, as well as the preliminary fair value of films and television programs in production, pre-production and development. For investment in films and television programs, the fair value was preliminarily estimated based on forecasted cash flows discounted to present value at a rate commensurate with the risk of the assets. Titles that were released less than three years prior to the acquisition date (December 27, 2023) were valued individually and will be amortized using the individual film forecast method, based on the ratio of current period revenues to management s estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned ("ultimate revenue"). Titles released more than three years prior to the acquisition date were valued as part of a library and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of years to years. 
 The intangible assets acquired include trade names with a weighted average estimated useful life of years. The fair value of the trade names was preliminarily estimated based on the present value of the hypothetical cost savings that could be realized by the owner of the trade names as a result of not having to pay a stream of royalty payments to another party. These cost savings were calculated based on a DCF analysis of the hypothetical royalty payment that a licensee would be required to pay in exchange for use of the trade names, reduced by the tax effect realized by the licensee on the royalty payments. 
 Other preliminary fair value adjustments were made to property and equipment and right-of-use lease assets to reflect the fair value of certain assets upon acquisition. 
 Deferred taxes, net of any required valuation allowance, were preliminarily adjusted to record the deferred tax impact of acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to amounts allocated to film and television programs, other intangible assets, and certain property and equipment, right-of-use lease assets, and other liabilities. 
 The fair value of eOne's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, participations and residuals, film related obligations and other liabilities were estimated to approximate their book values.

 3 Arts Entertainment. During the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2024 (in January 2024), the Company closed on the acquisition of an additional of 3 Arts Entertainment representing approximately half of the noncontrolling interest for million. In addition, the Company purchased certain profit interests held by certain managers and entered into certain option rights agreements, which replaced the put and call rights under the previous arrangement by providing noncontrolling interest holders the right to sell to the Company and the Company the right to purchase their remaining interest beginning in January 2027. 
 
 At the completion of the purchase, a portion of the noncontrolling interest continued to be considered compensatory, as it was subject to forfeiture provisions upon termination of employment under certain circumstances, and the remaining portion represented the noncontrolling interest holders' fully vested equity interest. Under the new arrangement, the holders' right to sell their interest to the Company, and the Company's right to purchase the noncontrolling interest, are based on a formula-based amount (i.e., a fixed EBITDA multiple), subject to a minimum purchase price, rather than being based on fair value. Since the redemption features described above were based on a formula using a fixed multiple, the compensatory portion of the noncontrolling interest is now considered a liability award, and as a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, approximately million was reclassified from mezzanine equity to a liability, and is reflected in "other liabilities - non-current" in the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024. 
 
 The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance related to 3 Arts Entertainment reflects the fully vested equity portion of the noncontrolling interest, which remains classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of shareholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets due to the purchase and sale rights beginning in 2027 which were determined to be embedded in the noncontrolling interest, and are outside the control of the Company. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is being adjusted to its redemption value through accumulated deficit through the sale or purchase right date in January 2027. Subsequent to the January 2024 transactions noted above, changes in the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are reflected in the calculation of basic and diluted net income or loss per common share attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. shareholders, if dilutive, or to the extent the adjustments represent recoveries of amounts previously reflected in the computation of basic and diluted net income or loss per common share attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. shareholders (see Note 12).

Prior to the Company s acquisition of the remaining interest, the noncontrolling interest was presented as a redeemable noncontrolling interest outside shareholders equity on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, due to put and call options which were determined to be embedded in the noncontrolling interest, and because the put rights were outside the control of the Company.

 Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are presented net of a provision for doubtful accounts. The Company estimates provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience for the respective risk categories and current and future expected economic conditions. To assess collectability, the Company analyzes market trends, economic conditions, the aging of receivables and customer specific risks, and records a provision for estimated credit losses expected over the lifetime of the receivables in direct operating expense. 
 The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations and monitors its credit exposure through active review of customers financial condition, aging of receivable balances, historical collection trends, and expectations about relevant future events that may significantly affect collectability. The Company generally does not require collateral for its trade accounts receivable.

 The Company s primary measure of segment performance is segment profit. Segment profit is defined as gross contribution (revenues, less direct operating and distribution and marketing expense) less segment general and administration expenses. Segment profit excludes, when applicable, corporate and allocated general and administrative expense, restructuring and other costs, share-based compensation, certain charges related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and purchase accounting and related adjustments. The Company believes the presentation of segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company s management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company s businesses.

 Interest Rate Swaps 
 The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, primarily through its borrowing activities. The Company s objective is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. The Company primarily uses pay-fixed interest rate swaps to facilitate its interest rate risk management activities, which the Company generally designates as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these designated cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in interest expense as the interest payments occur. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedges are recorded in interest expense (see further explanation below). 
 Cash settlements related to interest rate contracts are generally classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 In connection with the Separation, Business Combination and Intercompany Note described in Note 7, the Company assumed the rights, obligations, costs and benefits associated with and provided under the terms of Lionsgate s floating-to-fixed swap contracts.

 million to be allocated annually to Lionsgate. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of Lionsgate corporate general and administrative expenses, excluding amounts related to share-based compensation discussed below, were allocated to the Company. Of the total amount allocated to the Company during three and six months ended September 30, 2024, million and million was allocated to the Company after the Separation pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement. Prior to the Separation, during the six months ended September 30, 2024, million of corporate expenses were allocated to the Company (three and six months ended September 30, 2023 - million and million, respectively). 
 Share- based compensation: The Separation Agreement and the Shared Services Agreement provide that officers, employees and directors of LG Studios will continue to receive awards of equity and equity-based compensation pursuant to the existing equity incentive plans of Lionsgate. Such awards are treated as a capital contribution by Lionsgate to LG Studios, and the share-based compensation expense for such awards is allocated to LG Studios. 
 Prior to the Separation, Lionsgate provided share-based compensation related to the Studio Business employees and as part of its corporate expense allocations a proportionate amount of the share-based compensation related to those corporate functions is allocated to the Studio Business. 
 Licensing of content to the Starz Business: The Company licenses motion pictures and television programming (including Starz original productions) to the Starz Business. The license fees generally are due upon delivery or due at a point in time following the first showing. Prior to the Separation, license fee amounts due were settled with the Starz Business through parent net investment. License fees receivable, not yet due from the Starz Business, are reflected in due from the Starz Business on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The consideration to which the Company is entitled under the license agreements with the Starz Business is included in revenue from contracts with customers and presented separately in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations (see Note 11). 
 Operating expense reimbursement: As previously described in Note 1, the Company pays certain expenses on behalf of the Starz Business such as certain rent expense, employee benefits, insurance and other administrative operating costs. The Starz Business also pays certain expenses on behalf of the Company such as legal expenses, software development costs and severance. See Transactions with Lionsgate below for further discussion of the settlement of these transactions. These expenditures are reflected in the financial statements of the Studio Business and the Starz Business as applicable. 
 Monetization of certain accounts receivables: The Company had an agreement with Starz for Starz to transfer certain accounts receivables to the Company to participate in the Company s pooled monetization arrangement, which matured on October 1, 2023. The Company purchased the transferred receivables at fair value and recorded them at the purchased amount on its balance sheet and classified the purchase price paid in parent net investment (see Note 19). The accounts receivables purchased from the Starz Business were historically pledged as collateral under this agreement. Any discount on the purchase of the receivable from the Starz Business was accreted to interest income over the period to collection of the accounts receivable. The accounts receivable purchased from the Starz Business and subsequent collections were reflected as investing activities in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 Transactions with Lionsgate 
 Prior to the Separation, Lionsgate utilized a centralized approach to cash management. Cash generated by the Studio Business was managed by Lionsgate s centralized treasury function and cash was routinely transferred to the Company or to the Starz Business to fund operating activities when needed. Payables to and receivables from Lionsgate, primarily related to the Starz Business, were often settled through movement to the intercompany accounts between Lionsgate, the Starz Business and the Studio Business. Other than certain specific balances related to unsettled payables or receivables, the intercompany balances between the Studio Business and Lionsgate were accounted for as parent net investment. 
 Because of this centralized approach to cash management, financial transactions for cash movement and the settlement of payables and receivables when due with Lionsgate were generally accounted for through the parent net investment account. Settlements of amounts payable and receivable when due through the parent net investment account were reflected as cash

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 
 Lionsgate Studios Corp. (the Company, Lionsgate Studios, we, us, or our is a subsidiary of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp Lionsgate or Parent which encompasses the motion picture and television studio operations (collectively referred to as the Studio Business of Lionsgate. 
 The Studio Business consists of the Motion Picture and Television Production reportable segments, together with substantially all of Lionsgate s corporate general and administrative costs. The Motion Picture segment consists of the development and production of feature films, acquisition of North American and worldwide distribution rights, North American theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution of feature films produced and acquired, and worldwide licensing of distribution rights to feature films produced and acquired. The Television Production segment consists of the development, production and worldwide distribution of television productions including television series, television movies and mini-series, and non-fiction programming. The Motion Picture segment includes the licensing of motion pictures and the Television Production segment includes the licensing of Starz original productions to the STARZ-branded premium global subscription platforms (the Starz Business ). The Television Production segment also includes the ancillary market distribution of Starz original productions and licensed product. Additionally, the Television Production segment includes the results of operations of 3 Arts Entertainment, a talent management company. 
 Separation and Business Combination 
 On May 13, 2024, Lionsgate consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain business combination agreement (the Business Combination Agreement ), with Screaming Eagle Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company SEAC ), SEAC II Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEAC New SEAC ), LG Sirius Holdings ULC, a British Columbia unlimited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lionsgate Studio HoldCo ), LG Orion Holdings ULC, a British Columbia unlimited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Lionsgate StudioCo ), and other affiliates of SEAC. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, the Studio Business was combined with SEAC through a series of transactions, including an amalgamation of StudioCo and New SEAC under a Canadian plan of arrangement (the Business Combination ). In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, New SEAC changed its name to Lionsgate Studios Corp. and continues the existing business operations of the Studio Business of Lionsgate. The Company became a separate publicly traded company and its common shares, without par value LG Studios Common Shares ), commenced trading on Nasdaq under the symbol LION on May 14, 2024. 
 In connection with and prior to the Business Combination, Lionsgate and StudioCo entered into a separation agreement pursuant to which the assets and liabilities of the Studio Business were transferred to StudioCo such that StudioCo held, directly or indirectly, all of the assets and liabilities of the Studio Business (the Separation ). 
 The Business Combination has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with United States U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Under this method of accounting, SEAC was treated as the acquired company and the Studio Business was treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the financial statements of Lionsgate Studios will represent a continuation of the financial statements of the Studio Business, with the Business Combination treated as the equivalent of the Studio Business issuing LG Studios Common Shares for the historical net assets of SEAC, substantially consisting of cash held in the trust account, accompanied by a recapitalization of the Studio Business equity. The historical net assets of SEAC were stated at fair value, which approximated historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of the Studio Business. 
 The Studio Business has been determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination because Lionsgate continues to hold a controlling financial interest. 
 As a result of the Business Combination and additional private investments in public equities PIPE financing discussed in Note 2, former SEAC public shareholders and founders and new common equity financing investors own approximately 12.2 of LG Studios Common Shares. In addition to establishing the Studio Business as a standalone publicly-traded entity, the transaction resulted in approximately 330.0 million of gross proceeds to Lionsgate received at closing, including 254.3 million in PIPE financing. See Note 2, for additional information related to the Business Combination. The net proceeds from the transaction were used by the Company to pay down the Intercompany Note, see Note 7. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 Upon the effective date of the Separation, the Company s financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis, as Lionsgate completed the contribution of the Studio Business on such date. The unaudited financial statements for all periods 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 presented, including the historical results of the Company prior to the Separation, are now referred to as the condensed consolidated financial statements . 
 For periods prior to the Separation, the Company operated as a segment of Lionsgate and not as a separate entity. The Company s financial statements prior to the Separation were prepared on a carve-out basis and were derived from Lionsgate s consolidated financial statements and accounting records and reflect Studio Business s combined historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows as they were historically managed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Prior to the Separation, a management approach was applied to determine the carve-out basis of presentation. In using the management approach, considerations over how the business operates were utilized to identify historical operations that should be presented within the carve-out financial statements. 
 For periods subsequent to the Separation, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lionsgate Studios and all of its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. 
 All revenues and costs as well as assets and liabilities directly associated with the business activity of the Studio Business were included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Separation, revenues and costs associated with the Studio Business were specifically identifiable in the accounting records maintained by Lionsgate and primarily represent the revenue and costs used for the determination of segment profit of the Motion Picture and Television Production segments of Lionsgate. In addition, the Studio Business costs included an allocation of corporate general and administrative expense (inclusive of share-based compensation) which was allocated to the Studio Business as further discussed below. Other costs excluded from the Motion Picture and Television Production segment profit but relating to the Studio Business were generally specifically identifiable as costs of the Studio Business in the accounting records of Lionsgate and were included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in periods prior to the Separation . 
 In connection with the Business Combination, on May 9, 2024, Lionsgate and StudioCo entered into a shared services and overhead sharing agreement (the Shared Services Agreement which took effect upon the closing of the Business Combination. The Shared Services Agreement facilitates the allocation to the Company of all corporate general and administrative expenses of Lionsgate, except for an amount of 10.0 million to be allocated annually to Lionsgate. The 10.0 million allocation of Lionsgate s corporate general and administrative expenses to the Starz Business pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement is designed to reflect the portion of corporate expenses expended and reflective of the level of effort and costs incurred related to management oversight and services provided for the Starz Business post Separation with consideration of the anticipated separation of the Starz Business. 
 The corporate general and administrative expenses that are allocated to the Company pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement include salaries and wages for certain executives and other corporate officers related to executive oversight, investor relations costs, costs for the maintenance of corporate facilities, and other common administrative support functions, including corporate accounting, finance and financial reporting, audit and tax costs, corporate and other legal support functions, and certain information technology and human resources. In addition, the Separation Agreement and the Shared Services Agreement provide that officers, employees and directors of the Company will continue to receive awards of equity and equity-based compensation pursuant to the existing plans of Lionsgate. Such awards will be treated as a capital contribution by Lionsgate to the Company, with the associated stock based compensation expense for such awards allocated to the Company, see Note 13. 
 For periods prior to the Separation, the unaudited condensed combined financial statements of the Studio Business included allocations of corporate general and administrative expenses (inclusive of share-based compensation) from Lionsgate related to the corporate and shared service functions historically provided by Lionsgate. These expenses were allocated to the Company on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of consolidated Lionsgate revenue, payroll expense or other measures considered to be a reasonable reflection of the historical utilization levels of these services. 
 Management believes the assumptions underlying these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding the allocation of general and administrative expenses from Lionsgate to the Studio Business prior to the Separation, are reasonable. See Note 20 for further detail of the allocations included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 In connection with the Business Combination, the Company entered into certain intercompany note arrangements, which mirrored the terms and amounts outstanding under Lionsgate s credit facilities as previously reflected in the historical financial statements of the Studio Business prior to the Separation, see Note 7. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues are derived from the Motion Picture and Television Production segments, as described below. As mentioned above, we refer to our Motion Picture and Television Production segments collectively as our Studio Business. Our revenues 
 48 

Table of Contents 
 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 are derived from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries. None of the non-U.S. countries individually comprised greater than 10 of total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Motion Picture: Our Motion Picture segment includes revenues derived from the following: 
 Theatrical . Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the U.S. and through a sub-distributor in Canada). The revenues from Canada are reported net of distribution fees and release expenses of the Canadian sub-distributor. The financial terms that we negotiate with our theatrical exhibitors in the U.S. generally provide that we receive a percentage of the box office results. 
 Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms (including pay-per-view and video-on-demand platforms, electronic sell through, and digital rental). In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis. 
 Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets. In addition, when a license in our traditional pay television window is made to a subscription video-on-demand SVOD or other digital platform, the revenues are included here. 
 International. International revenues are derived from (1) licensing of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis; and (2) the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom. 
 Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, the licensing of our film and television and related content (games, music, location-based entertainment royalties, etc.) to other ancillary markets. 
 Television Production: Our Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following: 
 Television. Television revenues are derived from the licensing to domestic markets (linear pay, basic cable, free television and syndication) of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. Television revenues also include revenue from licenses to SVOD platforms in which the initial license of a television series is to an SVOD platform. Television revenues include fixed fee arrangements as well as arrangements in which we earn advertising revenue from the exploitation of certain content on television networks. 
 International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming. 
 Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series on packaged media and through digital media platforms. 
 Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, the licensing of our television programs to other ancillary markets, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from commissions and executive producer fees earned related to talent management. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include direct operating expenses, distribution and marketing expenses and general and administration expenses. 
 Direct operating expenses include amortization of film and television production or acquisition costs, participation and residual expenses, provision for doubtful accounts, and foreign exchange gains and losses. 
 Participation costs represent contingent consideration payable based on the performance of the film or television program to parties associated with the film or television program, including producers, writers, directors or actors. Residuals represent amounts payable to various unions or guilds such as the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America, based on the performance of the film or television program in certain ancillary markets or based on the individual s (i.e., actor, director, writer) salary level in the television market.

 Distribution and marketing expenses primarily include the costs of theatrical prints and advertising P A and premium video-on-demand Premium VOD expense and of DVD/Blu-ray duplication and marketing. Theatrical P A includes the costs of the theatrical prints delivered to theatrical exhibitors and the advertising and marketing cost associated with the theatrical release of the picture. Premium VOD expense represents the advertising and marketing cost associated with the Premium VOD release of the picture. DVD/Blu-ray duplication represents the cost of the DVD/Blu-ray product and the manufacturing costs associated with creating the physical products. DVD/Blu-ray marketing costs represent the cost of advertising the product at or near the time of its release or special promotional advertising. 
 General and administration expenses include salaries and other overhead. Following the Separation, the Shared Services Agreement facilitates the allocation of substantially all corporate general and administrative expenses to the Company, including salaries and wages for certain executives and other corporate officers related to executive oversight, investor relations costs, costs for the maintenance of corporate facilities, and other common administrative support functions, including corporate accounting, finance and financial reporting, audit and tax costs, corporate and other legal support functions, and certain information technology and human resources. Prior to the Separation, general and administrative expenses included allocations for certain general and administrative expenses from Lionsgate related to certain corporate and shared service functions historically provided by Lionsgate. See Basis of Presentation above, Note 1 and Note 20 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on the Shared Services Agreement and our methodology for allocating these costs for periods prior to the Separation. 
 For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, total Lionsgate corporate general and administrative expenses were 32.8 million and 63.1 million, respectively, of which 26.4 million and 51.0 million, respectively, was allocated to the Company. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. As described more fully below, these estimates bear the risk of change due to the inherent uncertainty of the estimate. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 to our audited combined financial statements as contained in Exhibit 99.1 of Amendment No. 2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 15, 2024. 
 Accounting for Films and Television Programs 
 Capitalized costs for films or television programs are predominantly monetized individually. 
 Amortization. Film cost amortization as well as participations and residuals expense are based on management s estimates. Costs of acquiring and producing films and television programs and of acquired libraries are amortized and estimated liabilities for participations and residuals costs are accrued using the individual-film-forecast method, based on the ratio of the current period s revenues to management s estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned ultimate revenue ). Management s judgment is required in estimating ultimate revenue and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each film or television program. 
 Management estimates ultimate revenues based on historical experience with similar titles or the title genre, the general public appeal of the cast, audience test results when available, actual performance (when available) at the box office or in markets currently being exploited, and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and which may change.

 For motion pictures, ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for a film intended for theatrical release is the film s theatrical performance, as subsequent revenues from the licensing and sale in other markets have historically been highly correlated to its theatrical performance. After a film s release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. 
 For an episodic television series, the period over which ultimate revenues are estimated cannot exceed ten years following the date of delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. The most sensitive factors affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for a television series is whether the series will be ordered for a subsequent season and estimates of revenue in secondary markets other than the initial license fee, which may depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the ratings or viewership the program achieves on the customers platforms. The initial estimate of ultimate revenue may include estimates of revenues outside of the initial license window (i.e., international, home entertainment and other distribution platforms) and are based on historical experience for similar programs (genre, duration, etc.) and the estimated number of seasons of the series. Ultimates of revenue beyond the initial license fee are generally higher for programs that have been or are expected to be ordered for multiple seasons. We regularly monitor the performance of each season, and evaluate whether impairment indicators are present (i.e., low ratings, cancellations or the season is not reordered), and based upon our review, we revise our estimates as needed and perform an impairment assessment if impairment indicators are present (see below). 
 For titles included in acquired libraries, ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed twenty years following the date of acquisition. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses, these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some films and titles are more successful or less successful than anticipated. Management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or a write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value (see below). 
 An increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, less film and television program amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film and television program amortization expense, and also periodically results in an impairment requiring a write-down of the film cost to the title s fair value. These write-downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. See further discussion below under Impairment Assessment . 
 Impairment Assessment. An individual film or television program is evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of an individual film is less than its unamortized cost. If the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. 
 Estimate of Fair Value. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title. For motion pictures intended for theatrical release, the discounted cash flow analysis used in the impairment evaluation prior to theatrical release is subjective and the key inputs include estimates of future anticipated revenues and estimates of box office performance, which may differ from future actual results. These estimates are based in part on the historical performance of similar films, test audience results when available, information regarding competing film releases, and critic reviews. For te levision programs, the discounted cash flow analysis used in the impairment evaluation includes key inputs such as estimates of future anticipated revenue, as discussed above. See further discussion of Valuation Assumptions below. 
 Valuation Assumptions. The discounted cash flow analysis includes cash flows estimates of ultimate revenue and costs as well as a discount rate (a Level 3 fair value measurement, see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). The discount rate utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the Company plus a risk premium representing the risk associated with producing a particular film or television program. Estimates of future revenue involve measurement uncertainty and it is therefore possible that reductions in the carrying value of investment in films and television programs may be required as a consequence of changes in management s future revenue estimates. 
 Revenue Recognition. Our Motion Picture and Television Production segments generate revenue principally from the licensing of content in domestic theatrical exhibition, home entertainment (e.g., digital media), television, and international market places. 
 51 

Table of Contents 
 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 Our content licensing arrangements include fixed fee and minimum guarantee arrangements, and sales or usage based royalties. Our fixed fee or minimum guarantee licensing arrangements in the television, digital media and international markets may, in some cases, include multiple titles, multiple license periods (windows) with a substantive period in between the windows, rights to exploitation in different media, or rights to exploitation in multiple territories, which may be considered distinct performance obligations. When these performance obligations are considered distinct, the fixed fee or minimum guarantee in the arrangement is allocated to the title, window, media right or territory as applicable, based on estimates of relative standalone selling prices. The amounts related to each performance obligation (i.e., title, window, media or territory) are recognized when the content has been delivered, and the window for the exploitation right in that territory has begun, which is the point in time at which the customer is able to begin to use and benefit from the content. 
 Sales or usage based royalties represent amounts due to us based on the sale or usage of our content by the customer, and revenues are recognized at the later of when the subsequent sale or usage occurs, or the performance obligation to which some or all the sales or usage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Generally, when we license completed content (with standalone functionality, such as a movie, or television show), our performance obligation will be satisfied prior to the sale or usage. When we license intellectual property that does not have stand-alone functionality (e.g., brands, themes, logos, etc.), our performance obligation is generally satisfied in the same period as the sale or usage. The actual amounts due to us under these arrangements are generally not reported to us until after the close of the reporting period. We record revenue under these arrangements for the amounts due and not yet reported to us based on estimates of the sales or usage of these customers and pursuant to the terms of the contracts. Such estimates are based on information from our customers, historical experience with similar titles in that market or territory, the performance of the title in other markets and/or available data in the industry. While we believe these estimates are reasonable estimates of the amounts due under these arrangements, such estimated amounts could differ from the actual amounts to be subsequently reported by the customer, which could be higher or lower than our estimates, and could result in an adjustment to revenues in future periods. 
 Revenue from the theatrical release of feature films are treated as sales or usage-based royalties and recognized starting at the exhibition date and based on our participation in box office receipts of the theatrical exhibitor . 
 Digital media revenue sharing arrangements are recognized as sales or usage based royalties. 
 Revenue from commissions are recognized as such services are provided. 
 Goodwill. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill was 806.5 million. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (component level). Reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether that information is regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, along with their respective goodwill balances at September 30, 2024, were Motion Picture (goodwill of 396 million), and our Television (goodwill of 317 million) and Talent Management (goodwill of 93 million) businesses, both of which are part of our Television Production segment. 
 Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test as of January 1 in each fiscal year. A goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An entity may perform a qualitative assessment of the likelihood of the existence of a goodwill impairment. The qualitative assessment is an evaluation, based on all identified events and circumstances which impact the fair value of the reporting unit of whether or not it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit. If we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required but may be performed at the option of the Company. A quantitative assessment requires determining the fair value of our reporting units. The determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and requires assumptions and estimates of many factors, including revenue and market growth, operating margins and cash flows, market multiples and discount rates. 
 In performing a quantitative assessment of goodwill, we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flow DCF analyses and market-based valuation methodologies. The models rely on significant judgments and assumptions surrounding general market and economic conditions, short-term and long-term growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and detailed management forecasts of future cash flow and operating margin projections, and other assumptions, all of which are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The market-based valuation method utilizes EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and a control premium. The results of these valuation methodologies are weighted as to their relative importance and a single fair value is determined. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying

 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessments: 
 Fiscal 2025. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, there were no events or circumstances that have changed that would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 
 Fiscal 2024 . For our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2024, we performed qualitative goodwill impairment assessments for all of our reporting units (Motion Picture, and our Television and Talent Management businesses, both of which are part of our Television Production segment). 
 Our qualitative assessments considered the recent performance of these reporting units, and updated forecasts of performance and cash flows, as well as the current micro and macroeconomic environments in relation to the current and expected performance of these reporting units, and industry considerations, and determined that since the date of the most recent quantitative assessment performed over these reporting units, there were no events or circumstances that rise to a level that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of those reporting units below their carrying values; therefore, a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was not required for these reporting units. 
 Management will continue to monitor all of its reporting units for further changes in the business environment that could impact the recoverability in future periods. The recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of revenue and cash flows from our business activities. Examples of events or circumstances that could result in changes to the underlying key assumptions and judgments used in our goodwill impairment tests, and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units may include the global economy; consumer consumption levels of our content; adverse macroeconomic conditions related to higher inflation and interest rates and currency rate fluctuations, and the impact on the global economy from wars, terrorism and multiple international conflicts, and future bank failures; volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in higher weighted-average cost of capital; capital market transactions; the duration and potential impact of strikes of unions, on our ability to produce, acquire and distribute our content; the commercial success of our television programming and motion pictures; our continual contractual relationships with our customers; and changes in consumer behavior. If our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that additional impairment charges may need to be recorded in the future. 
 Corporate expense allocation. For periods prior to the Separation, Lionsgate s corporate general and administrative functions and costs provided oversight over both the Starz Business and the Studio Business. These functions and costs include, but are not limited to, salaries and wages for certain executives and other corporate officers related to executive oversight, investor relations costs, costs for the maintenance of corporate facilities, and other common administrative support functions, including corporate accounting, finance and financial reporting, audit and tax costs, corporate and other legal support functions, and certain information technology and human resources. Accordingly, for periods prior to the Separation, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Studio Business include allocations of certain general and administrative expenses from Lionsgate of 14.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 26.4 million and 51.0 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to these corporate and shared service functions historically provided by Lionsgate. 
 The allocation of costs to the Studio Business were subjective and required considerable judgment. The allocations of general and administrative expenses to the Studio Business were on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of consolidated Lionsgate revenue, payroll expense or other measures management considered to be a reasonable reflection of the estimated historical utilization levels of these services. Following the Separation, 45.0 million of Lionsgate s corporate general and administrative costs were allocated to the Company pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement. In aggregate, allocations of Lionsgate s corporate general and administrative costs to the Company represent approximately 100.0 and 95.9 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 79.5 and 79.7 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, of total Lionsgate corporate general and administrative expense. See Components of Results of Operations-Expenses above for further information.

 Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and in several foreign jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences, net of applicable reserves in each jurisdiction. We recognize a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis; otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. In order to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in the future in each of the jurisdictions which have these deferred tax assets. However, the assessment as to whether there will be sufficient taxable income in a jurisdiction to realize our net deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction is an estimate which could change in the future depending primarily upon the actual performance of our Company. We will be required to continually evaluate the more likely than not assessment that our net deferred tax assets will be realized, and if operating results deteriorate in a particular jurisdiction, we may need to record a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets through a charge to our income tax benefit (provision). As of March 31, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance of 341.6 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis. 
 Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and is affected by many factors, including the overall level of income (loss) before taxes and its mix across the jurisdictions in which conduct operations, any changes in tax laws and regulations changes in valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, changes in unrecognized tax benefits, tax planning strategies available to us and other discrete items. 
 For periods prior to the Business Combination (including the period from April 1, 2024, through May 13, 2024), income taxes were calculated on a separate tax return basis. The separate tax return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if the Company was a separate taxpayer and standalone enterprise. The Company s U.S. operations, and certain of its non-U.S. operations historically were included in the income tax returns of Lionsgate or its subsidiaries that may not be part of the Company. Management believes the assumptions supporting the Company s allocation and presentation of income taxes on a separate tax return basis to be reasonable. 
 For periods following the Business Combination (including the period from May 14, 2024, through September 30, 2024), income taxes were calculated by applying an estimated effective income tax rate to the Company s ordinary income (loss), adjusted for the income tax effects of items that related discretely to the period, if any.

 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 Motion Picture revenue increased 11.2 million due to increased international revenue driven by Borderlands and the multi-platform release, The Killer s Game, partially offset by lower theatrical, and home entertainment revenue. Motion Picture revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 15.6 million of revenues from eOne. Motion Picture revenue included 72.1 million of revenue from licensing Motion Picture segment product to the Starz Business, representing an increase of 11.6 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Television Production revenue increased 22.7 million due to the inclusion of revenue from eOne of approximately 111.1 million, offset by lower home entertainment digital and international revenue. Television Production revenue included 149.9 million of revenue from licensing Television Production segment product to the Starz Business, representing an increase of 19.6 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses by segment were as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 of Revenues 2023 of Revenues Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) General and administrative expenses Motion Picture 22.8 26.7 (3.9) (14.6) Television Production 17.0 14.3 2.7 18.9 Corporate allocations from Lionsgate, excluding allocation of share-based compensation expense 28.1 26.5 1.6 6.0 Share-based compensation expense 15.3 17.4 (2.1) (12.1) Purchase accounting and related adjustments 1.7 2.2 (0.5) (22.7) Total general and administrative expenses 84.9 10.3 87.1 11.0 (2.2) (2.5) 
 General and administrative expenses decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from decreased Motion Picture general and administrative expenses, share-based compensation expense and purchase accounting and related adjustments, partially offset by increased Television Production general and administrative expenses and corporate expenses. Studio Business general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 6.0 million from eOne. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 As discussed in Components of Results of Operations , following the Separation, the Shared Services Agreement facilitates the allocation of substantially all corporate general and administrative expenses to the Company. For periods prior to the Separation, the Company has been allocated a portion of Lionsgate s total corporate expenses which are included in general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased approximately 1.6 million, or 6.0 , primarily due to approximately 3.0 million of corporate general and administrative expenses from eOne. 
 Certain of our employees participate in the share-based compensation plans sponsored by Lionsgate. For periods prior to the Separation, Lionsgate share-based compensation awards granted to employees of the Company were reflected in parent net investment within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of equity (deficit) at the time they are expensed in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents share-based compensation expense by financial statement line item: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Share-based compensation is comprised of: Studio employee share-based compensation expense 8.6 13.5 Allocation of Lionsgate corporate and shared employee share-based compensation expense 6.7 3.9 Total share-based compensation included in general and administrative expense 15.3 17.4 Restructuring and other (1)

 (1) Represents share-based compensation expense included in restructuring and other expenses reflecting the impact of the acceleration of vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements. 
 Purchase accounting and related adjustments include the expense associated with the noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment, and the non-cash charge for the amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price related to 3 Arts Entertainment, all of which are accounted for as compensation and are included in general and administrative expense. The noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings of 3 Arts Entertainment are reflected as an expense rather than noncontrolling interest in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations due

 to the relationship to continued employment. Purchase accounting and related adjustments decreased 0.5 million, or 22.7 , primarily due to lower noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment of 0.5 million associated with a lower noncontrolling interest ownership percentage as a result of our acquisition of an additional interest in 3 Arts Entertainment (see Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements).

 (1) Prior to the Separation, amounts reflect interest attributable to borrowings outstanding under Lionsgate s Credit Agreement (including the revolving credit facility, term loan A and term loan B). Subsequent to the Separation, amounts reflect interest attributable to borrowings outstanding under the Company s Intercompany Note with LGCH (see Note 7). 
 (2) IP credit facilities interest expense includes interest expense associated with the eOne IP Credit Facility and LG IP Credit Facility. 
 (3) Other interest expense includes payments associated with certain film related obligations (Production Tax Credit Facility, Film Library Facility, Backlog Facility and other, see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements), and payments and receipts associated with the Company s interest rate swaps (see Note 18 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements).

 Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income of 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to interest and other income of 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher interest income. 
 Other Expense. Other expense of 13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to other expense of 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to realized and unrealized foreign currency losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a decrease in the loss recorded related to our monetization of accounts receivable programs in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 19 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements).

 Loss on Investments, net. Loss on investments, net was nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Equity Interests Income (Loss). Equity interests loss of 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to equity interests income of 1.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower income generated by our equity method investees.

Our income tax expense and effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21 multiplied by income (loss) before taxes due to the mix of our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which our operations

 are conducted, changes in valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, certain minimum income and foreign withholding taxes, charges for interest on uncertain tax benefits, and benefits from the releases of reserves for uncertain tax benefits due to the close of audits or expirations of statutes of limitations.

 Segment Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Measures 
 The Company s primary measure of segment performance is segment profit. Segment profit is defined as segment revenues, less segment direct operating and segment distribution and marketing expense, less segment general and administration expenses. Total segment profit represents the sum of segment profit for our individual segments, net of eliminations for intersegment transactions. Segment profit and total segment profit excludes, when applicable, corporate general and administrative expense, restructuring and other costs, share-based compensation, certain programming and content charges as a result of changes in management and/or programming and content strategy, certain charges related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and purchase accounting and related adjustments. Segment profit when presented in accordance with ASC 280 within the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a GAAP financial measure and is disclosed in Note 16 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We also present below our total segment profit for all of our segments. Total segment profit, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in Note 16 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business. 
 The Company believes the presentation of total segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view total segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses before non-operating items. Total segment profit is considered an important measure of the Company s performance because it reflects the aggregate profit contribution from the Company's segments and represents a measure, consistent with our segment profit, that eliminates amounts that, in management s opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company s businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Not all companies calculate segment profit or total segment profit in the same manner, and segment profit and total segment profit as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items. 
 The following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating income (loss), to the non-GAAP measure, total segment profit, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, each of segment direct operating expense, distribution and marketing expense and general and administrative expense is reconciled to the respective line items presented in the GAAP-based statement of operations in the preceding section of the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which discusses consolidated results of operations.

 Theatrical revenue decreased 8.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 9.0 million from Lionsgate Original Releases due to greater revenue generated from the fiscal 2024 theatrical slate titles in the prior year as compared to the fiscal 2025 theatrical slate titles in the current year. 
 Home entertainment revenue decreased 54.8 million, or 30.1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower digital media revenue of 51.2 million primarily due to decreases from Lionsgate Original Releases. Digital media revenue from Lionsgate Original Releases declined 43.0 million due to digital media revenue in the prior year s quarter from our fiscal 2023 and prior theatrical slate titles, and in particular, John Wick: Chapter 4 and Jesus Revolution , which compared to lower revenue in the current quarter from our fiscal 2024 and prior theatrical slate titles. The decrease in digital media revenue was also due to a decrease from Other Film of 8.2 million from our acquired library titles. 
 Television revenue increased 7.9 million, or 7.8 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 6.4 million due to a greater number of television windows opening in the current quarter for our theatrical slate titles. 
 International revenue increased 68.3 million , or 85.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 63.5 million driven by higher revenue generated from our fiscal 2025 theatrical slate, and in particular, Borderlands , as compared to our fiscal 2024 theatrical slate, and increased revenue from multi-platform releases, and in particular, The Killer s Game . In addition, the increase in international revenue was also due to an increase from Other Film of 4.8 million from our acquired library titles. 
 Direct Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expenses is due to greater direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion picture revenue as compared to the prior year's quarter, driven by the change in the mix of titles and product categories generating revenue. In particular, the increase was driven by the performance and cost of the titles released in the quarter, including Borderlands, which had a higher amortization rate as compared to the titles released in the prior year's quarter. Investment in film write-downs included in Motion Picture segment direct operating expense were 18.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 26.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Distribution and Marketing Expense. The increase in distribution and marketing expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to higher theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense due to higher expense associated with the theatrical slate releases in the current quarter. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 15.4 million of theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense was incurred in advance for films to be released in subsequent quarters, compared to approximately 15.2 million in the prior year s quarter in the Motion Picture segment. 
 Gross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Motion Picture segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the negative contribution of the theatrical slate titles released in the quarter, including Borderlands , as a result of higher direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue, and higher theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense. These decreases in gross contribution were partially offset by increased Motion Picture revenue. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Picture segment decreased 3.9 million, or 14.6 , primarily due to a decrease in incentive based compensation.

 Six Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 of Revenues 2023 of Revenues Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) General and administrative expenses Motion Picture 51.3 56.1 (4.8) (8.6) Television Production 34.8 27.0 7.8 28.9 Corporate allocations from Lionsgate, excluding allocation of share-based compensation expense 59.2 51.0 8.2 16.1 Share-based compensation expense 27.9 29.0 (1.1) (3.8) Purchase accounting and related adjustments 3.8 12.4 (8.6) (69.4) Total general and administrative expenses 177.0 12.5 175.5 12.4 1.5 0.9 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased in the six months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from increased Television Production and corporate general and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreased purchase accounting and related adjustments, Motion Picture general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expense. Studio Business general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 13.0 million from eOne. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 As discussed in Components of Results of Operations , following the Separation, the Shared Services Agreement facilitates the allocation of substantially all corporate general and administrative expenses to the Company. For periods prior to the Separation, the Company has been allocated a portion of Lionsgate s total corporate expenses which are included in general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased approximately 8.2 million, or 16.1 , primarily due to approximately 6.0 million of corporate general and administrative expenses from eOne. 
 Certain of our employees participate in the share-based compensation plans sponsored by Lionsgate. For periods prior to the Separation, Lionsgate share-based compensation awards granted to employees of the Company were reflected in parent net investment within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of equity (deficit) at the time they are expensed in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents share-based compensation expense by financial statement line item: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Share-based compensation is comprised of: Studio employee share-based compensation expense 17.0 21.4 Allocation of Lionsgate corporate and shared employee share-based compensation expense 10.9 7.6 Total share-based compensation included in general and administrative expense 27.9 29.0 Restructuring and other (1) 
 4.6 0.5 Total share-based compensation expense 32.5 29.5 
 _______________________ 
 (1) Represents share-based compensation expense included in restructuring and other expenses reflecting the impact of the acceleration of vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements. 
 Purchase accounting and related adjustments include the expense associated with the noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment, and the non-cash charge for the amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price related to 3 Arts Entertainment, all of which are accounted for as compensation and are included in general and administrative expense. The noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings of 3 Arts Entertainment are reflected as an expense rather than noncontrolling interest in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations due to the relationship to continued employment. Purchase accounting and related adjustments decreased 8.6 million, or 69.4 ,

 primarily due to lower noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment of 7.1 million associated with a lower noncontrolling interest ownership percentage as a result of our acquisition of an additional interest in 3 Arts Entertainment (see Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). In addition, purchase accounting and related adjustments decreased due to lower amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price of 3 Arts Entertainment of 1.3 million, due to the amortization period ending in May 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization of 8.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.8 million from 8.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Restructuring and Other. Restructuring and other increased 25.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, and includes restructuring and severance costs and certain transaction and other costs, when applicable. Restructuring and other costs were as follows for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (see Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements):

 (2) Severance costs were primarily related to restructuring, acquisition integration activities and other cost-saving initiatives. 
 (3) Transaction and other costs in the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect transaction, integration and legal costs associated with certain strategic transactions, and restructuring activities and also include costs and benefits associated with legal and other matters. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense of 121.6 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 20.0 million from the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher average interest rates and balances on variable rate corporate debt and film related obligations, partially offset by a slightly larger benefit from the interest rate swaps.

 Other Expense. Other expense of 15.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to other expense of 13.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to realized and unrealized foreign currency losses in the six months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a decrease in the loss recorded related to our monetization of accounts receivable programs in the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 19 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements).

See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 There was no comparable loss on extinguishment of debt in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on Investments, net. Loss on investments, net was nil for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Equity Interests Income. Equity interests income of 0.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to equity interests income of 1.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower income generated by our equity method investees.

 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21 multiplied by income (loss) before taxes due to the mix of our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which our operations are conducted, changes in valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, certain minimum income and foreign withholding taxes, charges for interest on uncertain tax benefits, and benefits from the releases of reserves for uncertain tax benefits due to the close of audits or expirations of statutes of limitations. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Lionsgate Studios Corp. Shareholders Net loss attributable to our shareholders for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 156.8 million, or basic and diluted net loss per common share of 0.56 on 280.6 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to net loss attributable to our shareholders for the six months ended September 30, 2023 of 5.3 million, or basic and diluted net loss per common share of 0.02 on 253.4 million weighted average common shares outstanding. 
 Segment Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Measures 
 The Company s primary measure of segment performance is segment profit. Segment profit is defined as segment revenues, less segment direct operating and segment distribution and marketing expense, less segment general and administration expenses. Total segment profit represents the sum of segment profit for our individual segments, net of eliminations for intersegment transactions. Segment profit and total segment profit excludes, when applicable, corporate general and administrative expense, restructuring and other costs, share-based compensation, certain programming and content charges as a result of changes in management and/or programming and content strategy, certain charges related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and purchase accounting and related adjustments. Segment profit when presented in accordance with ASC 280 within the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a GAAP financial measure and is disclosed in Note 16 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We also present below our total segment profit for all of our segments. Total segment profit, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in Note 16 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business. 
 The Company believes the presentation of total segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view total segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses before non-operating items. Total segment profit is considered an important measure of the Company s performance because it reflects the aggregate profit contribution from the Company's segments and represents a measure, consistent with our segment profit, that eliminates amounts that, in management s opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company s businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Not all companies calculate segment profit or total segment profit in the same manner, and segment profit and total segment profit as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items. 
 The following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating income (loss), to the non-GAAP measure, total segment profit, for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, each of segment direct operating expense, distribution and marketing expense and general and administrative expense is reconciled to the respective line items presented in the GAAP-based statement of operations in the preceding section of the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which discusses consolidated results of operations.

 Theatrical revenue decreased 38.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 38.8 million from Lionsgate Original Releases due to revenue in the prior year s period from the fiscal 2023 theatrical slate release, John Wick:Chapter 4 , partially offset by increased revenue from multi-platform releases in the current period, and in particular, The Strangers: Chapter 1 . 
 Home entertainment revenue decreased 105.4 million, or 27.6 , in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower digital media revenue of 85.2 million primarily due to decreases from Lionsgate Original Releases. Digital media revenue from Lionsgate Original Releases declined 74.0 million due to revenue in the prior year's period from our fiscal 2023 and prior theatrical slate titles, and in particular, John Wick: Chapter 4 and Jesus Revolution, which compared to lower revenue in the current period from our fiscal 2024 and prior theatrical slate titles. This decrease in digital media revenue was partially offset by increased digital media revenue in the current period from our fiscal 2025 theatrical slate title, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. In addition, the decrease in home entertainment revenue was also due to lower packaged media revenue of 20.2 million primarily due to revenue in the prior year s period for John Wick:Chapter 4. 
 Television revenue increased 47.4 million, or 31.7 , in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 46.4 million due to a greater number of television windows opening in the current period for our theatrical slate titles, and higher revenue recognized for those titles, and in particular, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds Snakes. 
 International revenue increased 55.3 million , or 34.4 in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 37.1 million driven by higher revenue generated from our fiscal 2025 theatrical slate, and in particular, Borderlands , as compared to our fiscal 2024 theatrical slate, and increased revenue from multi-platform releases, and in particular, The Killer's Game, offset by revenue in the prior year's period for John Wick: Chapter 4. In addition, the increase in international revenue was also due to an increase from Other Film of 18.2 million from our acquired library titles. 
 Direct Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expenses is due to greater direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion picture revenue as compared to the prior year's period, driven by the change in the mix of titles and product categories generating revenue. In particular, the increase was driven by the performance and cost of the titles released in the period, including Borderlands , which had a higher amortization rate as compared to the titles released in the prior year's period. Investment in film write-downs included in Motion Picture segment direct operating expense were 18.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 27.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Distribution and Marketing Expens e. The decrease in distribution and marketing expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024 is due to lower theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense associated with the theatrical slate releases in the current period. In the six months ended September 30, 2024 approximately 20.9 million of P A and Premium VOD expense was incurred in advance for films to be released in subsequent quarters, compared to approximately 19.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 in the Motion Picture segment. 
 Gross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Motion Picture segment for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to the negative contribution of the theatrical slate titles released in the period, including Borderlands , as a result of higher direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue and lower Motion Picture revenue. These decreases in gross contribution were partially offset by lower Motion Picture distribution and marketing expense. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Picture segment in the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.8 million, or 8.6 , primarily due to a decrease in incentive based compensation.

 The primary component of Television Production revenue is domestic television revenue.

 International revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 20.1 million, or 19.0 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 26.8 million from revenues from the licensing of Starz original series to Starz Networks, partially offset by increased third-party revenue. 
 
 Home entertainment revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 42.2 million, or 43.6 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased digital media revenues, and in particular, digital media revenue in the prior year's period for The Continental, partially offset by increased revenues from the licensing of Starz original series to Starz Networks.

 Direct Operating Expense. Direct operating expense of the Television Production segment in the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 86.7 million, or 18.0 , due to the increase in Television Production revenues. Direct operating expenses as a percentage of television production revenue increased primarily due to the mix of titles generating revenue in the current period as compared to the prior year's period, and in particular, the prior year's period included significant revenue from The Continental which has a lower amortization rate as compared to the current period. There were no investment in film and television programs write-downs included in Television Production segment direct operating expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross Contribution.

 Intercompany Revolver: In connection with the Separation and Business Combination, on May 13, 2024, LGAC International LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company LGAC International and Lions Gate Capital Holdings 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of Lionsgate LGCH1 entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Intercompany Revolver ), pursuant to which LGAC International and LGCH1 agreed to make revolving loans to each other from time to time provided that the net amount owing by one party to the other at any particular time may not exceed 150.0 million. There was 80.4 million outstanding and due to LGCH1 at September 30, 2024. The Intercompany Revolver will, among other things, terminate in connection with a full separation of the entities. 
 eOne IP Credit Facility: In July 2024, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a senior secured amortizing term credit facility (the "eOne IP Credit Facility") based on and secured by the Company s intellectual property rights primarily associated with certain titles acquired as part of the eOne acquisition. The maximum principal amount of the eOne IP Credit Facility is 340.0 million, subject to the amount of collateral available, which is based on the valuation of unsold rights from the libraries, with 340.0 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The eOne IP Credit Facility matures on July 3, 2029. 
 LG IP Credit Facility: In September 2024, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a senior secured amortizing term credit facility (the "LG IP Credit Facility") based on and secured by the Company s intellectual property rights primarily associated with certain titles. The maximum principal amount of the LG IP Credit Facility is 455.0 million, subject to the amount of collateral available, which is based on the valuation of unsold rights from the libraries, with 455.0 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The LG IP Credit Facility matures on September 30, 2029. 
 Lionsgate Exchange Notes and Existing Notes: As discussed in Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, on May 8, 2024, LGCH1, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Lionsgate, which is not a consolidated subsidiary of Lionsgate Studios, issued 389.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.5 senior notes due 2029 (the Exchange Notes ). The Exchange Notes were exchanged by Lionsgate for an equivalent amount of Lionsgate s existing 5.5 senior notes due 2029 (the Existing Notes ). The Exchange Notes initially bear interest at 5.5 annually and mature April 15, 2029, with the interest rate increasing to 6.0 and the maturity date extending to April 15, 2030 effective upon completion of the separation of the Starz Business from the Studio Business. Lionsgate may redeem the Exchange Notes, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to or on and after the Separation Closing Date, as defined in the indenture governing the Exchange Notes, at certain specified redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Exchange Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 The Exchange Notes and Existing Notes and related interest expense are not reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are guarantors under the Exchange Notes and Existing Notes. Upon completion of the separation of the Starz Business from the Studio Business, the Exchange Notes will become obligations of the Company and will be reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our corporate debt. 
 
 Film Related Obligations 
 We utilize our film related obligations to fund our film and television productions. Our film related obligations at September 30, 2024 include the following: 
 Production Loans: Production loans represent individual and multi-title loans for the production of film and television programs that we produce. The majority of the Company s production loans have contractual repayment dates either at or near the expected completion or release dates, with the exception of certain loans containing repayment dates on a longer term basis. At September 30, 2024, there was 1,244.8 million outstanding of production loans. 
 Production Tax Credit Facility: We have a 260.0 million non-recourse senior secured revolving credit facility due January 2025 based on collateral consisting solely of certain of the Company s tax credit receivables (the Production Tax Credit Facility ). As of September 30, 2024, tax credit receivables amounting to 344.2 million represented collateral related to the Production Tax Credit Facility. Cash collections from the underlying collateral (tax credit receivables) are used to repay the Production Tax Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 there was 260.0 million outstanding under the Production Tax Credit Facility. 
 Film Library Facility: In July 2021, as amended in September 2022, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a senior secured amortizing term credit facility due July 2027 (the Film Library Facility based on the collateral consisting solely

Table of Contents 
 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 of certain of our rights in certain acquired library titles, including the Spyglass and other recently acquired libraries. The maximum principal amount of the Film Library Facility is 161.9 million, subject to the amount of collateral available, which is based on the valuation of cash flows from the libraries. At September 30, 2024 there was 94.2 million, outstanding under the Film Library Facility. 
 Backlog Facility and Other: 
 Backlog Facility. In March 2022, as amended in August 2022, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a committed secured revolving credit facility (the Backlog Facility based on collateral consisting solely of certain of the Company s fixed fee or minimum guarantee contracts where cash will be received in the future. The maximum principal amount of the Backlog Facility is 175.0 million, subject to the amount of eligible collateral contributed to the facility. The Backlog Facility revolving period finishes on May 16, 2025, at which point cash collections from the underlying collateral is used to repay the facility. The facility maturity date is up to two years and 90 days after the revolving period ends, currently August 14, 2027. As of September 30, 2024 there was 160.2 million outstanding under the Backlog Facility. 
 
 Other. The Company has other loans which are secured by accounts receivable and contracted receivables which are not yet recognized as revenue under certain licensing agreements. Outstanding loan balances under these other loans must be repaid with any cash collections from the underlying collateral if and when received by the Company, and may be voluntarily repaid at any time without prepayment penalty fees. As of September 30, 2024, there was 113.0 million outstanding under the "other" loans, of which 55.1 million has a contractual repayment date in July 2025 and 57.9 million has a contractual repayment date in April 2027. As of September 30, 2024, accounts receivable amounting to 72.7 million and contracted receivables not yet reflected as accounts receivable on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 amounting to 65.6 million represented collateral related to the other loans. 
 
 See Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our film related obligations. 
 
 Accounts Receivable Monetization and Governmental Incentives 
 Our accounts receivable monetization programs include individual agreements to monetize certain of our trade accounts receivable directly with third-party purchasers and previously have included a revolving agreement to monetize designated pools of trade accounts receivable with various financial institutions. 
 In addition, we utilize governmental incentives, programs and other structures from states and foreign countries (e.g., sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits, low interest loans, direct subsidies or cash rebates, calculated based on the amount of money spent in the particular jurisdiction in connection with the production) to fund our film and television productions and reduce financial risk. 
 See Note 19 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for our accounts receivable monetization programs and our tax credit receivables. 
 Uses of Cash 
 Our principal uses of cash in operations include the funding of film and television productions, film rights acquisitions, the distribution and marketing of films and television programs, and general and administrative expenses. We also use cash for debt service (i.e. principal and interest payments) requirements, equity method or other equity investments, capital expenditures, and acquisitions of or investment in businesses. 
 In addition, the Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest balance of 99.7 million as of September 30, 2024, related to its acquisition of a controlling interest, consisting of a limited liability company interest in 3 Arts Entertainment, which may require the use of cash in the event the holders of the noncontrolling interests require the Company to repurchase their interests (see Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase or refinance our outstanding debt through cash purchases, and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, refinancings, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges or refinancings, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, our assessment of opportunities to lower interest expense, contractual restrictions and other factors, and such repurchases or exchanges could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Anticipated Cash Requirements . The nature of our business is such that significant initial expenditures are required to produce, acquire, distribute and market films and television programs, while revenues from these films and television programs 
 79 

Table of Contents 
 LIONSGATE STUDIOS CORP. 

 are earned over an extended period of time after their completion or acquisition. In addition to the cash requirements of any potential future redemption of our noncontrolling interests as discussed above, which we may fund with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our line of credit and/ or new financing arrangements, we have other anticipated cash requirements outside of our normal operations. 
 In the short-term, we currently expect that our cash requirements for productions will increase and our marketing spend will decrease in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. 
 However, we currently believe that cash flow from operations, cash on hand, Intercompany Note availability, Intercompany Revolver availability, the monetization of trade accounts receivable, tax-efficient financing, the availability from other financing obligations and available production or intellectual property financing, will be adequate to meet known operational cash and debt service (i.e. principal and interest payments) requirements for the next 12 months and beyond, including the funding of future film and television production and theatrical and home entertainment release schedules, and future equity method or other investment funding requirements. We monitor our cash flow liquidity, availability, fixed charge coverage, capital base, film spending and leverage ratios with the long-term goal of maintaining our credit worthiness. 
 Our current financing strategy is to fund operations and to leverage investment in films and television programs in the short-term and long-term, through our cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility, eOne IP Credit Facility, LG IP Credit Facility, production loans, government incentive programs, the monetization of trade accounts receivable, our Production Tax Credit Facility, our Film Library Facility, our Backlog Facility, and other obligations. In addition, we may acquire businesses or assets, including individual films or libraries that are complementary to our business. Any such transaction could be financed through our cash flow from operations, credit facilities, equity or debt financing. If additional financing beyond our existing cash flows from operations and credit facilities cannot fund such transactions, there is no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us. Our ability to obtain any additional financing will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance, the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. Additionally, circumstances related to inflation and rising interest rates and bank failures has caused disruption in the capital markets, which could make financing more difficult and/or expensive, and we may not be able to obtain such financing. We may also dispose of businesses or assets, including individual films or libraries, and use the net proceeds from such dispositions to fund operations or such acquisitions, or to repay debt.

Post Completion of the Starz Separation of the Restructuring of Corporate Debt 
 In connection with Lionsgate s planned separation of Lionsgate Studios Corp. and the Starz Business (the Starz Separation ), we anticipate that the LGTV Revolver, LGTV Term Loan A and LGTV Term Loan B will be terminated. Additionally, upon completion of the Starz Separation, the Exchange Notes are expected to become obligations of the Company, while the Existing Notes, amounting to 325.1 million will remain obligations of the Starz Business. Our ability to fund our operations and capital needs depends upon our ability to generate ongoing cash from operations and our access to the capital markets. 
 We further anticipate the Company will enter into new revolving credit and asset backed facilities with an aggregate principal amount sufficient to repay the then current outstanding principal balances of the LGTV Revolver, LGTV Term Loan A and LGTV Term Loan B. Interest rates on borrowings are expected to be based on prevailing market interest rates for borrowers of a similar size and credit rating as us, which we currently estimate to be more than our current rates on the existing LGTV Revolver, LGTV Term Loan A and LGTV Term Loan B. However, there can be no assurance we can obtain financing at these rates which will depend on a number of factors including the market conditions at the time. The amounts to be refinanced prior to or at the time of the completion of the Starz Separation will differ from amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and depending on the market conditions and cash levels at the Company at the time of the completion of the Starz Separation, the Company could borrow more than or less than the amounts outstanding under our existing debt arrangements. 
 We expect the new facilities to include customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants as well as a maintenance covenants. 
 A final determination regarding our debt and capital structure and the debt and capital structure of the Starz Business has not yet been made. Our ability to obtain financing and the terms and amounts of such financing will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance, the condition of capital markets at the time we seek financing, and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. 
 
 Discussion of Operating, Investing, Financing Cash Flows 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 66.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased by 32.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, before foreign exchange effects on cash. Components of these changes are discussed below in more detail. 
 Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Change (Amounts in millions) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities (199.7) 273.5 (473.2) 
 
 Cash flows used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were 199.7 million compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 273.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due to greater cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities of 439.0 million. The decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven by higher cash used for investment in film and television programs, decreases in participations and residuals, and greater decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by greater proceeds from decreases in accounts receivable, net, and increases in deferred revenue.

 Cash flows used in investing activities were 33.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 8.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of a film library and related assets, partially offset by proceeds from the settlement of certain working capital items pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for eOne in the current period. 
 Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Financing Activities: Debt- borrowings 2,537.4 1,084.5 Debt- repurchases and repayments (2,448.8) (1,104.1) Net proceeds from (repayments and repurchases of) debt 88.6 (19.6) Film related obligations- borrowings 1,152.6 813.9 Film related obligations- repayments (1,236.0) (1,028.0) Net proceeds from (repayments of) film related obligations (83.4) (214.1) Net cash proceeds from the Business Combination and related transactions 283.1 Parent net investment (94.6) (63.2) Other financing activities (26.7) (1.2) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 167.0 (298.1)

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management 
 Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to interest rate risk results from the financial debt instruments that arise from transactions entered into during the normal course of business. As part of our overall risk management program, we evaluate and manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and currency exchange risks on an ongoing basis. Hedges and derivative financial instruments will continue to be used in the future in order to manage our interest rate and currency exposure. We have no intention of entering into financial derivative contracts, other than to hedge a specific financial risk. See Note 18 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financial instruments, and see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk found in our Prospectus. 
 Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our Intercompany Note, eOne IP Credit Facility, LG IP Credit Facility, and our film related obligations, are, and are expected to continue to be, at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. The applicable margin with respect to loans under the LGTV Revolver and LGTV Term Loan A is a percentage per annum equal to SOFR plus 0.10 plus 1.75 margin. The applicable margin with respect to loans under our LGTV Term Loan B is a percentage per annum equal to SOFR plus 0.10 plus 2.25 margin. Advances under the eOne Credit Facility and LG IP Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 2.25 per annum. Assuming the LGTV Revolver is drawn up to its maximum borrowing capacity of 1.1 billion, based on the applicable SOFR in effect as of September 30, 2024, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 1.3 million change in annual net interest expense on the LGTV Revolver, LGTV Term Loan A, LGTV Term Loan B, eOne IP Credit Facility, LG IP Credit Facility, and interest rate swap agreements. 
 The variable interest film related obligations (which includes our production loans, Production Tax Credit Facility, Film Library Facility, Backlog Facility and other) incur primarily SOFR-based interest, with applicable margins ranging from 0.25 to 3.25 per annum. A quarter point increase of the interest rates on the variable interest film related obligations would result in 3.1 million in additional costs capitalized to the respective film or television asset for production loans (based on the outstanding principal amount of such loans), and a 1.6 million change in annual net interest expense (based on the outstanding principal amount of such loans, and assuming the Production Tax Credit Facility and Backlog Facility are utilized up to their maximum capacity of 260.0 million and 175.0 million, respectively). 
 The following table presents information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table also presents the cash flows of the principal amounts of the financial instruments, or the cash flows associated with the notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments, and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity or required principal payment dates and the fair value of the instrument as of September 30, 2024:

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act ). These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 85 

As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 On December 27, 2023, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the companies constituting the Entertainment One television and film eOne business and, as a result, we have begun integrating the processes, systems and controls relating to eOne into our existing system of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with our integration plans. As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated whether any changes occurred to the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such control. Based on that evaluation, except for the processes, systems and controls relating to the integration of eOne, there has been no such change during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
