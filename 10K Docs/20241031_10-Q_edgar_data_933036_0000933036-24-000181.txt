 operating segments: Acima, Rent-A-Center, Mexico, and Franchising. 
 Our Acima segment, which primarily operates in the United States and Puerto Rico, includes the operations of Acima Holdings and certain locations previously operating under our Acceptance Now brand and generally offers consumers who do not qualify for traditional financing the lease-to-own transaction through staffed or unstaffed kiosks located within third-party retailer locations or other virtual options. In virtual locations, customers, either directly or with the assistance of a representative of the third-party retailer, initiate the lease-to-own transaction online in the retailers locations using our virtual solutions. 
 Our Rent-A-Center segment consists of company-owned lease-to-own stores in the United States and Puerto Rico that lease household durable goods to customers through lease purchase agreements. We also offer merchandise on an installment sales basis in certain of our stores under the names Get It Now and Home Choice in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Our Rent-A-Center segment operates through our company-owned stores and e-commerce platforms through rentacenter.com, getitnowstores.com and homechoicestores.com. 
 Our Mexico segment consists of our company-owned stores in Mexico that lease household durable goods to customers on a lease-to-own basis. 
 Rent-A-Center Franchising International, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Upbound Group, Inc., is a franchisor of lease-to-own stores. Our Franchising segment s primary source of revenue is the sale of rental merchandise to our franchisees, who in turn offer the merchandise to the general public for rent or purchase under a lease-to-own transaction. The balance of our Franchising segment s revenue is generated primarily from royalties based on franchisees monthly gross revenues.

 Lease Purchase Agreements 
 Rentals and Fees. Rental merchandise is leased to customers pursuant to lease-to-own agreements, which provide for weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly terms with non-refundable lease payments. At the expiration of each lease term, customers may renew the lease-to-own agreement for the next lease term. The customer has the right to acquire title of the merchandise either through an early purchase option or through payment of all optional lease renewal terms. Customers can terminate the lease-to-own agreement and return the product at the end of any lease term without penalty. Therefore, lease-to-own agreements are accounted for as operating leases. 
 Lease payments received at our Rent-A-Center stores, certain Acima locations formerly operating under the Acceptance Now brand, and Mexico stores must be prepaid in advance of the next lease renewal term. Under the Acima Holdings business model, in certain cases revenues may be earned prior to the lease payment due date, in which case revenue is accrued prior to receipt of the lease payment, net of estimated returns and uncollectible renewal payments. Under both models, rental revenue is recognized over the lease term. See Note 4 for additional information regarding accrued lease revenue. 
 Cash received for rental payments, including fees, prior to the period in which it should be recognized, is deferred and recognized according to the lease term. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, in deferred revenue included in accrued liabilities related to our lease-to-own agreements. Revenue related to various payment, reinstatement or late fees is recognized when paid by the customer at the point service is provided. Rental merchandise in our Rent-A-Center stores, certain Acima locations formerly operating under the Acceptance Now brand, and Mexico stores is depreciated using the income forecasting method and recognized in cost of rentals and fees in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations over the lease term. Lease merchandise under Acima Holdings is depreciated over the lease term using a straight-line depreciation method. Under the income forecasting method, the consumption of lease merchandise occurs during periods of rental and depreciation directly coincides with the receipt of rental revenue over the lease-to-own contract period. Depreciation under the straight-line method is recognized each period over the term of the lease-to-own contract irrespective of receipt of revenue payments from the customer. 
 We also offer additional optional product plans along with our lease-to-own agreements which provide customers with liability protection against significant damage or loss of a product, and club membership benefits, including various discount programs and product service and replacement benefits in the event merchandise is damaged or lost, and payment waivers in the event eligible customers become unemployed. Customers renew product plans in conjunction with their lease term renewals, and can cancel the plans at any time. Revenue for product plans is recognized over the term of the plan. Costs incurred related to product plans are primarily recognized in cost of revenues. 
 Revenue from contracts with customers 
 Merchandise Sales. Merchandise sales include payments received for the exercise of the early purchase options offered through our lease-to-own agreements or merchandise sold through point-of-sale transactions. Revenue for merchandise sales is recognized when payment is received and ownership of the merchandise passes to the customer. The remaining net value of merchandise sold is recorded to cost of merchandise sold at the time of the transaction. 
 Installment Sales. Revenue from the sale of merchandise in our retail installment stores is recognized when the installment note is signed and control of the merchandise has passed to the customer. The cost of merchandise sold through installment agreements is recognized in cost of installment sales at the time of the transaction. We offer optional extended service plans with our installment agreements which are administered by third parties and provide customers with product maintenance beyond the term of the installment agreement. Payments received for extended service plans are deferred and recognized, net of

 million and million, respectively, in deferred revenue included in accrued liabilities related to extended service plans. 
 Franchise Merchandise Sales. Revenue from the sale of rental merchandise is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the franchisee. 
 Royalty Income and Fees. Franchise royalties, including franchisee contributions to corporate advertising funds, represent sales-based royalties calculated as a percentage of gross rental payments and sales. Royalty revenue is accrued and recognized as rental payments and merchandise sales occur. Franchise fees are initial fees charged to franchisees for new or converted franchise stores. Franchise fee revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the franchise agreement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, in deferred revenue included in accrued liabilities related to franchise fees. 
 Other. Other revenue consists of revenue generated by other miscellaneous product plans offered to our rental and installment customers. Revenue for other product plans is recognized in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan agreement.

 million and million, respectively. 
 Trade and notes receivables consist of amounts due from our lease-to-own customers for lease renewal payments and past due uncollected lease payments, adjusted for the probability of collection based on our assessment of historical collection rates and length of time the receivable is past due; amounts owed from our franchisees for inventory purchases, earned royalties and other obligations; and other corporate related receivables. Credit is extended to franchisees based on an evaluation of each franchisee s financial condition and collateral is generally not required. Trade receivables are generally due within 30 days.

 (1) Trade and notes receivables includes accrued revenue, adjusted for the probability of collection, related to our lease-to-own agreements of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Lease receivables are accrued on a net basis, adjusted for the probability of collection based on our assessment of historical collection rates, as described above. Therefore, we do not maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts related to our lease receivables. 
 We have established an allowance for doubtful accounts for our installment notes receivable. Our policy for determining the allowance is primarily based on historical loss experience, as well as the results of management s review and analysis of the payment and collection of the installment notes receivable within the previous year. We believe our allowance is adequate to absorb all expected losses. Our policy is to charge off installment notes receivable that are 120 days or more past due. Charge-offs are applied as a reduction to the allowance for doubtful accounts and any recoveries of previously charged off balances are recognized as contra-bad debt expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The allowance for our Franchising trade and notes receivables is determined by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history, the franchisee s current ability to pay its obligation, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Trade receivables that are more than 90 days past due are either written-off or fully reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Payments subsequently received on such receivables are recognized as contra-bad debt expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a lower tax impact of stock compensation expense related to stock consideration issued to the former owners of Acima Holdings in the form of restricted stock awards, compared to the prior year period. Please reference Note 9 for additional information regarding the recognition of these restricted stock awards in our condensed consolidated financial statements. For tax purposes, restricted stock awards subject to restricted stock agreements issued to the former owners of Acima Holdings were recorded as goodwill and are amortized over a period of years from the date of acquisition.

Commitments under the ABL Credit Facility may be increased, at our option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional million in the aggregate. 
 Proceeds from the Term Loan Facility were net of original issue discount of million upon issuance from the lenders. In addition, in connection with the closing of the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Credit Facility, we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs, including third party legal and other professional fees, of which million was capitalized in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt and recorded as a reduction of our outstanding senior debt, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 On August 10, 2022, we entered into a First Amendment to the ABL Credit Facility, effective as of August 10, 2022. The amendment effected the replacement of LIBOR with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate Term SOFR as the benchmark rate of interest thereunder. 
 On June 15, 2023, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Term Loan Facility, effective as of June 15, 2023. The amendment effected the replacement of LIBOR with Term SOFR as the benchmark rate of interest. 
 On May 28, 2024 we entered into a Third Amendment to the Term Loan Facility, effective as of May 28, 2024. The amendment, in addition to certain other changes, effected a repricing of the applicable margin under the Term Loan Facility by reducing the applicable margin, with respect to any initial term loans, by basis points from to and removing the credit spread adjustment that was previously included in the calculation of the adjusted Term SOFR rate for term benchmark loans. 
 In connection with the execution of the Third Amendment to the Term Loan Facility, we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs, including third party arrangement and other professional fees, of which approximately million were expensed as debt refinance charges in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, and approximately million were capitalized and recorded as a reduction to our outstanding senior debt in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt , we recorded approximately million in write-offs of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount previously capitalized upon the issuance of the Term Loan Facility on February 17, 2021.

The write-offs were recorded as debt refinance charges in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining balance of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount related to our senior debt reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was approximately million and million, respectively.

 We had outstanding borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 and borrowing capacity of million, net of issued letters of credit of approximately million. The amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was million at September 30, 2024. 
 ABL Credit Facility 
 The ABL Credit Facility will mature on , (subject to certain springing maturity provisions). We may borrow only up to the lesser of the level of the then-current borrowing base and the aggregate amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility. The borrowing base is tied to the amount of eligible installment sales accounts, inventory and eligible lease contracts, reduced by certain reserves. 
 The ABL Credit Facility bears interest at a fluctuating rate determined by reference to an adjusted Term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of to .

A commitment fee equal to to of the unused portion of the ABL Credit Facility fluctuates dependent upon average utilization for the prior month as defined by a pricing grid included in the governing documents of the ABL Credit Facility. The commitment fee at September 30, 2024 was . We paid million of commitment fees during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until , at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The obligations under the ABL Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and certain of our material wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations under the ABL Credit Facility and such guarantees are secured on a first-priority basis by all of our and our subsidiary guarantors accounts, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts, cash and cash equivalents, rental agreements, general intangibles (other than equity interests in our subsidiaries), chattel paper, instruments, documents, letter of credit rights, commercial tort claims related to the foregoing and other related assets and all proceeds thereof related to the foregoing, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions (such assets, collectively, the ABL Priority Collateral and a second-priority basis in substantially all other present and future tangible and intangible personal property of ours and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The ABL Credit Facility contains covenants that are usual and customary for similar facilities and transactions and that, among other things, restrict our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to create certain liens and enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our and our restricted subsidiaries assets, to another person; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock or certain other debt; and make other restricted payments.

 The Term Loan Facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of our present and future tangible and intangible personal property, including our subsidiary guarantors, other than the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined below), and by a second-priority security interest in the ABL Priority Collateral, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by us and our material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that also guarantee the ABL Credit Facility. 
 The Term Loan Facility contains covenants that are usual and customary for similar facilities and transactions and that, among other things, restrict our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to create certain liens and enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee certain indebtedness; consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our and our restricted subsidiaries assets, to another person; pay dividends or make other distributions on, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock or certain other debt; and make other restricted payments. The Term Loan Facility also includes mandatory prepayment requirements related to asset sales (subject to reinvestment), debt incurrence (other than permitted debt) and excess cash flow, subject to certain limitations described therein. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the governing documents of the Term Loan Facility. 
 In the event our Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Term Loan Facility credit agreement) exceeds 1:1, we are required to prepay the loans under the Term Loan Facility by a percentage of annual excess cash flow, as more fully described in the Term Loan Facility credit agreement. We made mandatory excess cash flow prepayments of approximately million, including million in accrued interest, in March 2023, relating to results for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The Term Loan Facility provides for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, failure to pay principal and interest, failure to comply with covenants, agreements or conditions, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency involving us and our significant subsidiaries.

Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs, including bank financing fees and third party legal and other professional fees, which were capitalized in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt and recorded as a reduction of our outstanding Notes in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt issuance costs are amortized as interest expense over the term of the Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining balance of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our Notes reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was approximately million. 
 We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time for cash at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. If we experience specific kinds of change in control, we will be required to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In addition, for these regulatory matters we incurred litigation and defense expenses of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Internally Developed Software Depreciation.

Deployment of the new system across our lease-to-own store network began in the second quarter of 2024 and was completed in the third quarter of 2024, at which time our existing point-of-sale software was retired. Therefore, in the third quarter of 2023, we accelerated the remaining useful lives of our existing point-of-sale software assets to align with the deployment timeline of our new point-of-sale system, which resulted in the recognition of additional depreciation expense of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

These restricted stock agreements were fully vested during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

 million of a million initial holdback escrowed at the closing of the transaction remains available for fines, penalties or customer restitution paid in connection with a resolution of the CFPB matter, including an adverse litigation outcome. Although the CFPB s complaint does not contain a specific monetary demand, the CFPB s initial monetary settlement demand exceeded the remaining million holdback by a substantial amount. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the remaining escrowed amount will be sufficient to address all covered losses that may ultimately be incurred for this matter. In addition, Acima has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial legal and related expenses associated with this matter, which are not recoverable from the holdback amount. 
 Multi-State Attorneys General Investigation. In November 2021, Acima received a letter from the Nebraska Attorney General s office stating that the Attorney General of Nebraska, along with a coalition of thirty-eight state Attorneys General, initiated a multi-state investigation into the business acts and practices of Acima and that a civil investigative demand(s) and/or subpoena(s) pursuant to respective state consumer protection laws will be forthcoming. Since receiving the letter, we have held multiple discussions and attended meetings with officials at many of the applicable attorneys general offices including members of the Executive Committee, which is leading the negotiations on behalf of the multistate group (the Multistate ). Based on our engagement with the Multistate, it is our understanding that the investigation involves forty states and the District of Columbia. In April 2022, we received a request for information and documents, and we have produced various records in response to the request. In March 2024, the Multistate presented their findings and allegations from their investigation to Acima. In May 2024, Acima submitted its response to the Multistate s presentation. 
 In the second quarter 2024, Acima received a settlement proposal from the Multistate. Since then, the parties have continued to engage in conversations regarding a potential resolution and Acima has responded to the Multistate s initial settlement proposal and monetary demand. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, although we would not be willing to agree to the Multistate s monetary demand which we believe is unsupportable or agree to a number of the other terms presented by the Multistate, we expect to continue to discuss the potential resolution of this matter. We are currently unable to predict whether or on what terms, including the amount of a monetary payment and the nature of business practice changes, any settlement with the Multistate, or individual members of the group, can be achieved. If we are unable to reach agreement on terms acceptable to us and to the various states involved in the group, some or all of such states may commence legal proceedings against Acima. We cannot provide any assurance that any settlement or adverse result in litigation will not require a monetary payment and/or changes to Acima s business practices or operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

Our Business 
 We are a leading lease-to-own provider with operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico. We provide a critical service for underserved consumers by providing them with access to, and the opportunity to obtain ownership of, high-quality, name brand durable products under a flexible lease-purchase agreement with no long-term debt obligation. Our Acima segment offers lease-to-own solutions through retailers in stores and online enabling such retailers to grow sales by expanding their customer base utilizing our differentiated offering and allowing customers to access our flexible lease-to-own solutions at thousands of retailers and to lease a wide range of durable products. Through our Rent-A-Center segment, we provide a fully integrated customer experience through our e-commerce platform and brick and mortar presence in local communities around the country. We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986, and our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol UPBD. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is focused on achieving our mission to elevate financial opportunity for all and growing our business through emphasis on the following key initiatives: 
 Grow penetration with current Acima third-party retailers and build on our strength with small to medium size businesses while also adding new national and regional third-party retailers to our platform and expanding our direct-to-consumer channels; 
 At Rent-A-Center, accelerate the shift to e-commerce, improve the fully integrated omni-channel customer experience and expand product categories, which we expect will increase brand awareness and customer loyalty; 
 Leverage data analytics capabilities to attract new customers, approve more customers and mitigate risk across business segments; 
 Upgrade and integrate technology platforms to allow for a more simplified and seamless consumer experience, third-party retailer and waterfall integration and consumer transaction process and coworker efficiency; 
 Execute on market opportunities and enhance our competitive position across both traditional and virtual lease-to-own solutions, and implement complementary products and services that supplement our current offerings and provide our customers more financial alternatives; and 
 Develop centers of excellence that will be leveraged across the organization to support our various business segments, utilizing best practices to drive efficiency and growth. 
 As we pursue our strategy, we have taken, and may in the future take, advantage of joint venture, partnership, or merger and acquisition opportunities from time to time that advance our key initiatives and elevate the financial mobility of underserved consumers. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Dividend. On September 19, 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0.37 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. The dividend was paid on October 22, 2024 to our common stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 1, 2024. 
 Refranchise Sale. On September 9, 2024, we sold 55 Rent-A-Center stores in the states of New York and New Jersey to a franchisee. We received cash consideration of approximately 19.1 million, including approximately 0.6 million related to franchise fees. The sale included on rent and held for rent inventory of approximately 13.0 million, property assets of approximately 2.0 million, and prorated rent and other miscellaneous expenses of 0.4 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately 3.1 million. 
 
 Business and Operational Trends 
 Macroeconomic Conditions. In recent years, we have experienced significant change in our business and operational trends driven by macroeconomic conditions, which have directly impacted our customers as well as our operations, including significant changes in the U.S. consumer price index, changes in demand for certain consumer retail categories, changes in consumer payment behaviors, a condensed labor market, which has also contributed to wage inflation, rapid increases in interest rates, and global supply chain disruptions resulting in reduced product availability and rising product costs. 
 While the lease-to-own industry has historically remained a resilient business model throughout various economic cycles, the full extent to which our risk management strategy and these macroeconomic trends (including consumer spending and payment 
 
 24 

behavior) may impact our business in future periods is uncertain. The continuation of negative and volatile macroeconomic trends may have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, including our results of operations, operating cash flows, liquidity and capital resources. 
 See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional discussion of impacts to our business and additional risks associated with macroeconomic conditions. 
 Rent-A-Center e-commerce revenue. In recent years, e-commerce revenues increased as a percentage of total rentals and fees revenue in our Rent-A-Center segment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, e-commerce revenues represented approximately 26 of total lease-to-own revenues. Due to recent trends in consumer shopping behaviors and expectations, we believe e-commerce solutions are an important part of our lease-to-own offering. However, we are unable to quantify the extent to which e-commerce revenues are incremental compared to what our overall revenues would have been in the absence of those e-commerce transactions. In addition, the profitability of e-commerce transactions can be impacted by different merchandise loss factors compared to traditional store-based transactions in the Rent-A-Center segment. Therefore, we are unable to determine with certainty whether the continuation of this trend toward increased e-commerce transactions will have a significant impact to our financial statements in future periods or be favorable or unfavorable to our financial results. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion focuses on our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Key Metrics 
 Gross Merchandise Volume GMV ): The Company defines Gross Merchandise Volume as the retail value in U.S. dollars of merchandise acquired by the Acima segment that is leased to customers through a transaction that occurs within a defined period, net of estimated cancellations as of the measurement date. 
 Lease Portfolio Value: Represents the aggregate dollar value of the expected monthly rental income associated with current active lease agreements from our Rent-A-Center stores and e-commerce platform at the end of any given period. 
 Same Store Lease Portfolio Value : Represents the aggregate dollar value of the expected monthly rental income associated with current active lease agreements from our Rent-A-Center stores that were operated by us for 13 months or more at the end of any given period. The Company excludes from the same store base any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from closed stores or acquisitions. The receiving store will be eligible for inclusion in the same store base in the 30th full month following account transfer. 
 Same Store Sales: Same store sales generally represents revenue earned in Rent-A-Center stores that were operated by us for 13 months or more and are reported on a constant currency basis as a percentage of total revenue earned in stores of the segment during the indicated period. The Company excludes from the same store sales base any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from closed stores or acquisitions. The receiving store will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the 30th full month following account transfer. 
 Lease Charge-Offs LCOs (previously referred to as skip / stolen losses ): Represents charge-offs of the net book value of unrecoverable on-rent merchandise with lease-to-own customers who are past due. This is typically expressed as a percentage of revenues for the applicable period. For the Rent-A-Center segment, LCOs exclude Get It Now and Home Choice locations. 
 
 Overview 
 The following briefly summarizes certain of our financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenues. Revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in merchandise purchases by franchisees of 5.9 million and 9.6 million, respectively. 
 Gross Profit. Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 26.7 and 25.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 21.4 and 22.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to the changes in allocation of merchandise sales compared to royalty and fee revenue. 
 Operating Profit. Operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 17.4 and 15.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 11.6 and 14.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in operating profit as a percentage of segment revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the changes in allocation of merchandise sales compared to royalty and fee revenue. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is also due to an increase in segment operating expenses of 1.2 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 166.7 million in operating cash flow, used cash in the amount of 291.6 million for debt repayments, 62.0 million for dividends and 44.2 million for capital expenditures, and had cash proceeds from indebtedness of 215.0 million and proceeds from sale of property assets of 18.3 million. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 85.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding indebtedness of 1.3 billion.

Analysis of Cash Flow. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by 53.2 million to 166.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 219.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in our inventory purchases driven by increased consumer demand. 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased to 27.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 36.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to proceeds from sale of property assets of 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by an increase in investment in store-related assets in our Rent-A-Center segment. 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased to 145.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 223.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility of 215.0 million and a decrease in share repurchases of 24.0 million, partially offset by an increase in debt repayments of 157.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity Requirements . Our primary liquidity requirements are for rental merchandise purchases, which are impacted by consumer demand for our lease-to-own solutions. Other capital requirements include expenditures for technology and property assets, and debt service. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations. 
 We utilize our ABL Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the ABL Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities. We believe cash flow generated from operations and availability under our ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations during the next twelve months. At October 24, 2024, we had approximately 53.1 million in cash on hand, and 474.4 million available under our ABL Credit Facility. 
 
 Merchandise Losses . Merchandise losses consist of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Lease charge-offs 78,966 68,925 237,593 208,375 Other merchandise losses (1)

 (1) Other merchandise losses include unrepairable and missing merchandise, and loss/damage waiver claims. 
 Capital Expenditures . We make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations, acquire new capital assets in new and acquired stores and invest in information technology. We spent 44.2 million and 36.2 million on capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 8.0 million is primarily due to higher investment in store-related assets in our Rent-A-Center segment. 
 
 Acquisitions and New Location Openings. The table below summarizes the store location activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 for our Rent-A-Center, Mexico and Franchising operating segments.

 Senior Debt. On February 17, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and lenders party thereto, that provides for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility with commitments of 550 million and a letter of credit sublimit of 150 million, which commitments may be increased, at our option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional 125 million in the aggregate (as amended on June 7, 2024, the ABL Credit Facility ). Under the ABL Credit Facility, we may borrow only up to the lesser of the level of the then-current borrowing base and the aggregate amount of commitments under the ABL Credit Facility. The borrowing base is tied to the amount of eligible installment sales accounts, inventory and eligible lease contracts, reduced by certain reserves. The ABL Credit Facility bears 
 
 33 

interest at a fluctuating rate determined by reference to an adjusted Term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.50 to 2.00 , which, as of October 24, 2024, was 6.95 . A commitment fee equal to 0.250 to 0.375 of the unused portion of the ABL Credit Facility fluctuates dependent upon average utilization for the prior month as defined by a pricing grid included in the documentation governing the ABL Credit Facility. Loans under the ABL Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until June 7, 2029, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. 
 The obligations under the ABL Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and certain of our material wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations under the ABL Credit Facility and such guarantees are secured on a first-priority basis by all of our and our subsidiary guarantors accounts, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts, cash and cash equivalents, rental agreements, general intangibles (other than equity interests in our subsidiaries), chattel paper, instruments, documents, letter of credit rights, commercial tort claims related to the foregoing and other related assets and all proceeds thereof related to the foregoing, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions (such assets, collectively, the ABL Priority Collateral and a second-priority basis in substantially all other present and future tangible and intangible personal property of ours and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. 
 On February 17, 2021, we also entered into a term loan credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and lenders party thereto, that provides for a seven-year 875 million senior secured term loan facility (as amended on May 28, 2024, the Term Loan Facility ). Subject in each case to certain restrictions and conditions, we may add up to 500 million of incremental term loan facilities to the Term Loan Facility or utilize incremental capacity under the Term Loan Facility at any time by issuing or incurring incremental equivalent term debt. Interest on borrowings under the Term Loan Facility is payable at a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the Term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 , subject to a 0.50 Term SOFR floor, which, as of October 24, 2024 was 8.00 . 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1.000 per annum of the original aggregate principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. The Term Loan Facility is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of present and future tangible and intangible personal property of us and our subsidiary guarantors, other than the ABL Priority Collateral, and by a second-priority security interest in the ABL Priority Collateral, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by us and our material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that also guarantee the ABL Credit Facility. 
 At October 24, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 804.5 million under the Term Loan Facility and available commitments of 474.4 million under our ABL Credit Facility, net of letters of credit. 
 See Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our senior debt. 
 Senior Notes . On February 17, 2021, we issued 450 million in senior unsecured notes due February 15, 2029, at par value, bearing interest at 6.375 (the Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2021. We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time for cash at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. If we experience specific kinds of change in control, we will be required to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. See Note 7 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our senior notes. 
 
 Operating Leases . We lease space for all of our Rent-A-Center and Mexico stores under operating leases expiring at various times through 2034. In addition, we lease space for certain support facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2032. Most of our store leases are five year leases and contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years at rental rates adjusted according to agreed-upon formulas. As of September 30, 2024, our total remaining obligation for existing store lease contracts was approximately 321.1 million. 
 We lease vehicles for all of our Rent-A-Center stores under operating leases with lease terms expiring twelve months after the start date of the lease. We classify these leases as short-term and have elected the short-term lease exemption for our vehicle leases, and have therefore excluded them from our operating lease right-of-use assets within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024, our total remaining minimum obligation for existing Rent-A-Center vehicle lease contracts was approximately 4.2 million. 
 We also lease vehicles for all of our Mexico stores which have terms expiring at various times through 2027 with rental rates adjusted periodically for inflation. As of September 30, 2024, our total remaining obligation for existing Mexico vehicle lease contracts was approximately 3.7 million. 
 
 Uncertain Tax Position. As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded 0.5 million in uncertain tax positions. Although these positions represent a potential future cash liability to us, the amounts and timing of such payments are uncertain. 
 
 34 

Seasonality. Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease purchase agreements in our Acima and Rent-A-Center segments or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor in our Rent-A-Center segment during the first quarter of each fiscal year, primarily due to the receipt of federal income tax refunds. In contrast, our cash expenditures for our merchandise purchases for the fiscal year are generally the highest beginning in the latter part of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of holiday promotions that lead to increased demand for our lease-to-own offerings. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which is intended to improve the transparency of the annual income tax disclosures by requiring specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation and disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 will be required for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We do not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. As of September 30, 2024, unless otherwise discussed (including with respect to ASU 2023-07), we believe the impact of any other recently issued standards that are not yet effective are either not applicable to us at this time, or will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposure is fluctuations in interest rates. Monitoring and managing this risk is a continual process carried out by our senior management. We manage our market risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments, giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings. As a result of such assessment, we may enter into swap contracts or other interest rate protection agreements from time to time to mitigate this risk. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 450 million in Notes outstanding at a fixed interest rate of 6.375 . We also had 804.5 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility at an interest rate indexed to the Term SOFR rate. Carrying value of the Term Loan Facility approximates fair value for such indebtedness. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 1.0 increase or decrease in market interest rates would have the effect of causing an additional 8.0 million annualized pre-tax charge or credit to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 We are also exposed to market risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of our stores in Mexico are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures . In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting . For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that, in the aggregate, have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We, along with our subsidiaries, are party to various legal proceedings and governmental inquiries and investigations given the nature of our business. We regularly monitor developments related to these matters, determine whether a reserve is appropriate if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, and review the adequacy of our reserves for such matters on a quarterly basis. As a result, we do not have reserves for all matters with respect to which we may or will have future liability, and no assurance can be given that our reserves, when recorded, will be adequate to cover the full amount of any loss we may ultimately incur. In addition, certain of the matters described herein involve demands for monetary relief and changes to our business practices that could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations were we to agree to them as part of a settlement or be subject to them following an adverse result in litigation. We cannot predict the ultimate resolution of our pending legal proceedings and governmental inquiries and investigations or other similar matters that may arise in the future given the nature of our business and the inherent uncertainty associated with legal proceedings and governmental inquiries and investigations. Please see Note 12 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion of certain of our legal proceedings and governmental inquiries.
