 shares of Class A common stock, par value per share (the Old Atlas Class A Common Stock at a price of per share. The IPO generated million of gross proceeds and net proceeds of approximately million. The gross proceeds were offset by million of underwriting discounts and commissions, million of current offering costs in 2023, and million in offering costs paid in 2022. Reorganization In connection with the IPO and pursuant to a master reorganization agreement dated March 8, 2023, by and among Old Atlas, Atlas Sand Management Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ASMC ), Atlas LLC, Atlas Sand Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Holdings ), Atlas Sand Operating, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Atlas Operating ), Atlas Sand Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Holdings II ), Atlas Sand Management Company II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ASMC II ), and Atlas Sand Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Merger Sub ), Old Atlas and the parties thereto completed certain restructuring transactions (the Reorganization ). As part of the Reorganization: Merger Sub merged with and into Atlas LLC, with Atlas LLC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlas Operating; 

 Holdings, Holdings II and ASMC II were formed (collectively with ASMC, the HoldCos ), through which certain holders who previously held membership interests in Atlas LLC (the Legacy Owners were issued the membership interests in Atlas Operating, as represented by a single class of common units Operating Units 

 certain Legacy Owners, through the HoldCos, transferred all or a portion of their Operating Units and voting rights, as applicable, in Atlas Operating to Old Atlas in exchange for an aggregate of shares of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock and, in the case of Legacy Owners that continued to hold Operating Units through the HoldCos, an aggregate of shares of Class B Common Stock, par value per share, of Old Atlas (the Old Atlas Class B Common Stock, and together with the Old Atlas Class A Common Stock, the Old Atlas Common Stock ), so that such Legacy Owners that continued to hold Operating Units also held, through the HoldCos, one share of Old Atlas Class B Common Stock for each Operating Unit held by them immediately following the Reorganization; 

 the shares of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock issued to Atlas LLC at the formation of Old Atlas were redeemed and canceled for nominal consideration; and 

 Old Atlas contributed all of the net proceeds received by it in the IPO to Atlas Operating in exchange for a number of Operating Units equal to the number of shares of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock outstanding after the IPO, and Atlas Operating further contributed the net proceeds received to Atlas LLC. 

5 

shares of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock, collectively representing of the voting power and of the economic interest of Old Atlas (and 82.0 of the economic interest of Atlas LLC, including both direct and indirect ownership interests) at the closing of the IPO and Reorganization; 

 Old Atlas owned an approximate interest in Atlas Operating; and 

 the Legacy Owners that continued to hold Operating Units collectively owned an approximate interest in Atlas Operating. 

 On March 13, 2023, the date on which Old Atlas closed the IPO, a corresponding deferred tax liability of approximately million was recorded associated with the differences between the tax and book basis of the investment in Atlas LLC. The offset of the deferred tax liability was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As there was no change in control of Atlas Operating, Atlas LLC, or the businesses or subsidiaries held by Atlas LLC as a result of the Reorganization, purchase accounting was not required and the Legacy Owners interests in Operating Units were recognized as a noncontrolling interest in Atlas Operating. On September 13, 2023, we distributed the Operating Units and shares of Old Atlas Common Stock previously held by the HoldCos to the Legacy Owners in accordance with the distribution provisions of each respective HoldCo operating agreement. Immediately following the distribution, the Legacy Owners held shares of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock or Old Atlas Class B Common Stock (and corresponding Operating Units) directly. Up-C Simplification On October 2, 2023, Old Atlas and the Company completed the Up-C Simplification (as defined below) contemplated by the Master Reorganization Agreement (the Master Reorganization Agreement ), dated as of July 31, 2023, by and among the Company, Old Atlas, Atlas Operating, AESI Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation PubCo Merger Sub ), Atlas Operating Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Opco Merger Sub and, together with PubCo Merger Sub, the Merger Subs ), and Holdings, in order to, among other things, reorganize under a new public holding company (the Up-C Simplification ). Pursuant to the Master Reorganization Agreement, (a) PubCo Merger Sub merged with and into Old Atlas (the PubCo Merger ), as a result of which (i) each share of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock then issued and outstanding was exchanged for one share of Common Stock of New Atlas, par value per share (the New Atlas Common Stock or the Common Stock ), (ii) all of the shares of Old Atlas Class B Common Stock then issued and outstanding were surrendered and cancelled for no consideration and (iii) Old Atlas survived the PubCo Merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; and (b) Opco Merger Sub merged with and into Atlas Operating (the Opco Merger and, together with the PubCo Merger, the Mergers ), as a result of which (i) each Operating Unit then issued and outstanding, other than those Operating Units held by Old Atlas, was exchanged for one share of New Atlas Common Stock and (ii) Atlas Operating became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Atlas. In connection with the Up-C Simplification: each share of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers (the Effective Time was exchanged for one share of New Atlas Common Stock and the holders of Old Atlas Class A Common Stock became stockholders of New Atlas; 

 all of the Old Atlas Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was surrendered and cancelled for no consideration; 

 each Operating Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Operating Units held by Old Atlas, was exchanged for one share of New Atlas Common Stock, and the holders of such Operating Units became stockholders of New Atlas; 

 Old Atlas continues to hold all of the issued and outstanding Operating Units it held as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Operating Units were otherwise unaffected by the Up-C Simplification (including the Opco Merger), and such Operating Units, together with the Operating Units received by New Atlas in connection with the Opco Merger, constitute all of the Operating Units currently issued and outstanding; 

 Old Atlas became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New Atlas, and all of the Old Atlas Class A Common Stock then held by New Atlas was recapitalized into a single share; 

6 

million was recorded associated with the exchange of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Old Atlas for shares of New Atlas Common Stock. The offset of the deferred tax liability was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As there was no change in control of Old Atlas, or the businesses or subsidiaries held by Old Atlas as a result of the Up-C Simplification, purchase accounting was not required and the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was removed to reflect the change in the Company s ownership interest. Hi-Crush Transaction On March 5, 2024 Closing Date ), the Company completed the acquisition of the Permian Basin proppant production and logistics businesses and operations of Hi-Crush Inc., a Delaware corporation Hi-Crush ), in excha nge for mixed consideration totaling million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments (the Hi-Crush Transaction ), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 26, 2024 (the Merger Agreement ), by and among the Company, Atlas LLC, Wyatt Merger Sub 1 Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlas LLC, Wyatt Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlas LLC, Hi-Crush, each stockholder that had executed the Merger Agreement or a joinder thereto (each a Hi-Crush Stockholder and, collectively, the Hi-Crush Stockholders ), Clearlake Capital Partners V Finance, L.P., solely in its capacity as the Hi-Crush Stockholders representative and HC Minerals Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, the Parties ).

Mine development project costs are capitalized once the deposit is classified as a proven and probable reserve. Mine development costs include engineering, mineralogical studies, drilling and other related costs to develop the mine and remove the overburden to initially expose the mineral and allow for the construction of an access way. Exploration costs are expensed as incurred and classified as exploration expense. Mining property and development costs are amortized using the units of production method on estimated recoverable tonnage, which equals estimated proven and probable reserves. The impact to reserve estimates is recognized on a prospective basis. Drilling and related costs are capitalized for deposits where proven and probable reserves exist. These activities are directed at obtaining additional information on the deposit or converting non-reserve minerals to proven and probable reserves, with the benefit being realized over a period greater than one year. Impairment or Disposal of Property, Plant and Equipment The Company periodically evaluates whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company estimates future undiscounted net cash flows using estimates, including but not limited to estimates of proven and probable sand reserves, estimated future sales prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors), operating costs and anticipated capital expenditures. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets.

Our 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility (defined in Note 7 - Leases with Stonebriar Commercial Finance LLC Stonebriar ), pursuant to which Stonebriar extended a million single advance seven-year term loan credit facility bears interest at a fixed rate of , where its fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and credit quality. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of long-term debt has been determined by discounting the future cash flows using current market interest rates for similar financial instruments. These inputs are not quoted prices in active markets, but they are either directly or indirectly observable; therefore, they are classified as Level 2 inputs. 

 Our ADDT Loan (defined in Note 8 - Debt with Stonebriar in the aggregate principal amount of million, payable in 76 consecutive monthly installments, bears interest at a fixed rate of , where its fair value will fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and credit quality. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of long-term debt has been determined by discounting the future cash flows using current market interest rates for similar financial instruments. These inputs are not quoted prices in active markets, but they are either directly or indirectly observable; therefore, they are classified as Level 2 inputs. 

 The carrying amount of the Company s 2023 ABL Credit Facility (defined in Note 8- Debt approximated fair value as it bears interest at variable rates over the term of the loan. Therefore, we have classified this long-term debt as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 

 The Deferred Cash Consideration Note (defined in Note 8- Debt entered into in connection with the Hi-Crush Transaction was determined to not be at market. Therefore, in order to record the debt at fair value as of the acquisition date, the Company calculated a discount of million. With the adjustment, the fair value of the Deferred Cash Consideration Note approximates the carrying value. We considered the implied debt rating of the Company and the associated interest rates available in the public debt market. There fore we have classified this long-term debt as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

 We believe the fair value of our other indebtedness approximates the carrying value. This balance is comprised of equipment financing agreements. We considered the rates entered into for 2024 equipment financing agreements for the same equipment. Therefore we have classified this long-term debt as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s revenue was generated in Texas and New Mexico. Revenue is disaggregated by product and service sales, no further disaggregation of revenue information is provided. The Company has elected to use the ASC 606 practical expedients, pursuant to which it has excluded disclosures of transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations and when it expects to recognize such revenue. The remaining performance obligations are primarily comprised of unfulfilled contracts to deliver product, most of which hold a remaining duration of less than one year, and of which ultimate transaction prices will be allocated entirely to the unfulfilled contracts. The Company s transaction prices under these contracts may be impacted by market conditions and potential contract negotiations, which have not yet been determined, and are therefore variable in nature. Deferred Revenues The Company occasionally receives prepayments from customers for future deliveries of product or contributions in aid of construction. Amounts received from customers in advance of product deliveries are recorded as contract liabilities referred to as deferred revenues and are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the produc t. Certain prepayments are secured by collateral interest in certain property, plant and equipment. In connection with the Hi-Crush Transaction, the Company acquired customer prepayments and recorded million of deferred revenue as of March 5, 2024. The Company recognized revenue of million and million from deferred revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to further refinement and may require significant adjustments to arrive at the final purchase price allocation. The above fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and are based on the information that was available as of the reporting date. The Company retained an independent appraiser to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price of Hi-Crush has been allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their preliminary estimated acquisition date fair values. The fair value estimates were based on income, market, and cost valuation methods. The excess of the total consideration over the estimated fair value of the amounts initially assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill. In many cases, the determination of the fair values required estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows and other future events that are based on the Company's best judgment from the information available. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities will be completed as soon as the necessary information becomes available but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the valuation of deferred income taxes. The Company expects to continue to obtain information for the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date throughout the remainder of the measurement period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a purchase price adjustment of million in net assets acquired and reclassifications within property, plant, and equipment that resulted in an increase of million in depreciation, depletion and accretion expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we had purchase price adjustments of million in net assets acquired and reclassifications within property, plant, and equipment. This resulted in an increase of million in depreciation, depletion and accretion expense, an increase of million in amortization expense, and an increase of million in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The preliminary estimate of the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined primarily using the income approach, which requires a forecast of all of the expected future cash flows either through the with or without method or the relief-from-royalty RFR method. Customer relationships were valued using the with or without method. The with or without method is an approach that considers the hypothetical impact to the projected cash flows of the business if the intangibles asset were not put in place. 

 Trade name was valued using the RFR method. The RFR method of valuation suggests that in lieu of ownership, the acquirer can obtain comparable rights to use the subject asset via a license from a hypothetical third-party owner. The asset s fair value is the present value of license fees avoided by owning it (i.e., the royalty savings). 

 Reserves The preliminary estimate of the fair value of the reserves were valued at million using the income approach. Reserves are recorded in property, plant and equipment, net on the Company's condensed consolidated balan ce sheets. Reserves were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method MPEEM ). The MPEEM is an approach where the net earnings attributable to the asset being measured are isolated from other contributory assets over the intangible asset s remaining economic life. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table summarizes, on an unaudited pro forma basis, the condensed combined results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, assuming the Hi-Crush Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2023 (in thousands).

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company concluded it had a triggering event requiring an assessment for impairment as a result of the fire at one of the Kermit facilities that caused damage to the physical condition of the Kermit asset group. The Company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluates the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis. The Company performed a recoverability test and determined there was no impairment of the associated asset group for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded a million loss from the disposal, which is recorded as a loss on disposal of assets on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company disposed of a dredge asset that was damaged during commissioning at one of the Kermit facilities.

shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to awards under the LTIP.

The LTIP will be administered by the Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee of the Board. We had shares of the Company's Common Stock available for future grants as of September 30, 2024.

Restricted Stock Unit s RSUs represent the right to receive shares of New Atlas Common Stock at the end of the vesting period in an amount equal to the number of RSUs that vest.

The RSUs are subject to restrictions on transfer and are generally subject to a risk of forfeiture if the award recipient ceases providing services to the Company prior to the date the award vests. If the participant s employment with or service to the Company is terminated for cause or without good reason prior to the vesting of all of the RSUs, and unless such termination is a Qualifying Termination or due to a Change in Control as defined in the applicable RSU agreement, any unvested RSUs will generally terminate automatically and be forfeited without further notice and at no cost to the Company.

to of the Target PSUs (as defined in the Performance Share Unit Grant Agreement governing the PSUs (the PSU Agreement )), subject to the Compensation Committee s discretion to increase the ultimate number of vested PSUs above the foregoing maximum level. Each PSU also includes a tandem dividend equivalent right, which is a right to receive an amount equal to the cash dividends made with respect to a share of Common Stock during the Performance Period (as defined in the PSU Agreement), which will be adjusted to correlate to the number of PSUs that ultimately become vested pursuant to the PSU Agreement. PSUs (b ased on target) were granted in 2024 (the 2024 PSUs ). The Performance Goals (as defined in the PSU Agreement) for the 2024 PSUs are based on a combination of Return on Capital Employed ROCE and Relative TSR (each, as defined in the PSU Agreement), with 25 weight applied to ROCE and 75 weight applied to Relative TSR, each as measured during the three-year Performance Period ending December 31, 2026. The vesting level is calculated based on the actual total stockholder return achieved during the Performance Period. The fair value of such PSUs was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and will be recognized over the applicable Performance Period. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award to calculate the fair value of the award. Expected volatilities in the model were estimated using a historical period consistent with the Performance Period of approximately three years. The risk-free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury rate for a term commensurate with the expected life of the grant. We recognized stock-based compensation related to PSUs of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 The ABL Amendment requires that if Availability (as defined in the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of (i) 12.50 of the Borrowing Base and (ii) 12.5 million, Atlas LLC must maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement) of at least 1.00 to 1.00 while a Covenant Trigger Period (as defined in the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement) is in effect. 
 Under the ABL Amendment, Atlas LLC is permitted to make payments of dividends and distributions pursuant to certain limited exceptions and baskets set forth therein and otherwise generally subject to certain restrictions described therein, including that (i) no Event of Default (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) no loans and no more than 7.5 million in letters of credit that have not been cash collateralized are outstanding, and liquidity exceeds 30.0 million at all times during the 30 days prior to the date of the dividend or distribution; provided that if any loans are outstanding or outstanding letters of credit exceed 7.5 million and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then Atlas LLC is permitted to make payments of dividends and distributions if, (i) Specified Availability (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement) is higher than the greater of (a) 20.0 million and (b) 20 of the pro forma Borrowing Base (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement) then in effect and during the 30 days prior to the date of the dividend or distribution as if such dividend or distribution had been made at the beginning of such period, or if (ii) (a) Specified Availability is higher than the greater of (x) 15.0 million and (y) 15 of the pro forma Borrowing Base then in effect and during the 30 days prior to the date of the dividend or distributions as if such dividend or distribution had been made at the beginning of such period and (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement), as calculated on a pro forma basis, is greater than 1.00 to 1.00, as provided under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement. Additionally, Atlas LLC may make additional payments of dividends and distributions in qualified equity interests and may make Permitted Tax Distributions (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement). 
 On March 5, 2024, the Company drew down 50.0 million under the 2023 ABL Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. The draw included 0.3 million in debt issuance costs and 0.3 million in deferred financing costs. These costs are recorded under other long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement.

 Recent Trends and Outlook 
 The price for West Texas Intermediate WTI crude oil ended the third quarter of 2024 at 70.24 per barrel Bbl ), as compared to 82.69 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of approximately 15 . Global oil demand decelerated during the period on the heels of fluttering Chinese demand coupled with a heightened risk of future global economic headwinds. However, OPEC+ countries reiterated plans for a continued delay to production hikes. This, coupled with continued heightened geopolitical tensions across Europe and the Middle East have supported a higher oil price environment as conflicts in both Ukraine and across the Middle East persist. 
 As a result, oilfield activity levels during the period were relatively muted. The Permian Basin drilling rig count declined by two active rigs quarter-over-quarter, ending the period at 306 active rigs. While we are seeing efficiencies drive overall shale production, fewer drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing crews are required for the equivalent production output. 
 However, notwithstanding the volatility in the oil and gas markets, there remain three potential positive long-term trends that benefit us: 
 First, E P companies continue to drill longer lateral wells, which drives up proppant demand for each well completed in the Permian Basin. Longer laterals increase the number of frac stages required to frac as well. As lateral lengths continue to increase, the aggregate amount of proppant per well increases. 

Second, frac sand demand continues to increase due to improved completion efficiencies, driven by steady improvement in the average tons of sand pumped per frac crew per month. As frac crews become more efficient, they are able to increase their monthly sand consumption. 

Third, E P companies continue to adopt Simul- and Trimul-frac completions designs which can consume up to 30 more proppant than typical legacy completion designs. 

We believe our increase in size and enhanced scale and reliability, in part resulting from the acquisition of Hi-Crush, will allow us to meet the growing scale of E P companies as they continue to consolidate. While the available Permian Basin proppant supply continues to grow, we believe the market has the potential to remain stable during the second half of 2024, and potential to tighten in 2025 as we believe activity levels could increase in the event commodity prices move higher. 
 How We Generate Revenue 
 We generate revenue by mining, processing and distributing proppant that our customers use in connection with their operations. We sell proppant to our customers under supply agreements or as spot sales at prevailing market rates, which is dependent upon the cost of producing proppant, the proppant volumes sold and the desired margin and prevailing market conditions. 
 Revenues also include charges for sand logistics services provided to our customers. Our logistics service revenue fluctuates based on several factors, including the volume of proppant transported, the distance between our facilities and our customers, and prevailing freight rates. Revenue is generally recognized as products are delivered in accordance with the contract. 
 Some of our contracts contain shortfall provisions that calculate agreed upon fees that are billed when the customer does not satisfy the minimum purchases over a period of time defined in each contract. 
 36 

Costs of Conducting Our Business 
 We incur operating costs primarily from direct and indirect labor, freight charges, utility costs, fuel and maintenance costs and royalties. We incur labor costs associated with employees at our proppant production facilities, which represent the most significant cost of converting proppant to finished product. Our proppant production facilities undergo maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and ensure the ongoing quality of our proppant and ability to meet customer demands. We may incur variable utility costs in connection with the operation of our processing facilities, primarily natural gas and electricity, which are both susceptible to market fluctuations. We lease equipment in many areas of our operations, including our proppant production hauling equipment. We incur variable royalty expense and/or delay rentals related to our agreements with the owners of our reserves. In addition, other costs including overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion are capitalized as a component of inventory and are reflected in cost of sales when inventory is sold. Our logistics services incur operating costs primarily composed of variable freight charges from trucking companies' delivery of sand to customer wellsites, equipment leases, direct and indirect labor, fuel and maintenance costs and royalties. 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion, Contribution Margin, Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Net Debt are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures used by our management and by external users of our Financial Statements such as investors, research analysts and others, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, to assess our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of development activities, provide views on capital resources available to organically fund growth projects and, in the case of Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, assess the financial performance of our assets and their ability to sustain dividends or reinvest to organically fund growth projects over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before depreciation, depletion and accretion expense, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, interest expense, income tax expense, stock and unit-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposal of assets, insurance recovery (gain), unrealized commodity derivative gain (loss), other acquisition related costs, and other non-recurring costs. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Certain prior period non-recurring costs of goods sold are now included as an add-back to adjusted EBITDA in order to conform to the current period presentation and to more accurately describe the Company s operating performance and results period-over-period. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total sales. 
 We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Maintenance Capital Expenditures. We define Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash used in investing activities. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures are useful to investors as they provide measures of the ability of our business to generate cash. 
 We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by total sales. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Margin as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures divided by total sales. 
 We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We define Contribution Margin as gross profit plus depreciation, depletion and accretion expense. 
 We define Maintenance Capital Expenditures as capital expenditures excluding growth capital expenditures and reconstruction of previously incurred growth capital expenditures. 
 We define Net Debt as total debt, net of discount and deferred financing costs, plus right-of-use lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion, Contribution Margin, Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Net Debt do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, income from operations, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP as measures of our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion, Contribution Margin, Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Net Debt may differ from computations of similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin, Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Margin, Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion, Contribution Margin, Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Net Debt to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated.

Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations 
 M A Activity 
 On March 5, 2024, the Company completed the Hi-Crush Transaction, in which the Company acquired substantially all of Hi-Crush s Permian Basin proppant production and logistics businesses and operations in exchange for (i) cash consideration of 140.1 million, (ii) 9.7 million shares of Common Stock issued at the closing of the transaction, and (iii) the Deferred Cash Consideration Note in an initial aggregate principle amount of 111.8 million. This history impacts the comparability of our operational results from year to year. Additional information on these transactions can be found in Note 3 - Hi-Crush Transaction of the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Public Company Expenses 
 As a result of the IPO, we incurred direct, incremental selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company, including, but not limited to, costs associated with hiring new personnel, implementation of compensation programs that are competitive with our public company peer group, including stock-based compensation, preparing quarterly reports to stockholders, tax return preparation, independent and internal auditor fees, investor relations activities, registrar and transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation. These direct, incremental selling, general and administrative expenses are not included in our results of operations prior to the IPO. 
 Income Taxes 
 Atlas Inc. is a corporation subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Although Atlas Predecessor is subject to margin tax in the State of Texas (at less than 1 of modified pre-tax earnings), it is and historically has been treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, and as such generally is and was not subject to U.S. federal, state or local income taxes. Rather, the tax liability with respect to the taxable income of Atlas Predecessor is and was passed through to its owners. Accordingly, the financial data attributable to Atlas Predecessor contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality (other than margin tax in the State of Texas). Atlas Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes at a blended statutory rate of approximately 22 . 
 We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. 
 On March 13, 2023 (the closing date of the IPO), a corresponding deferred tax liability of approximately 27.5 million associated with the differences between the tax and book basis of the investment in Atlas LLC was recorded. The offset of the deferred tax liability was recorded to additional paid-in capital. 
 On October 2, 2023, the date on which the Company completed the Up-C Simplification, a corresponding deferred tax liability of approximately 62.7 million was recorded associated with the exchange of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Old Atlas for shares of the Company's Common Stock. The offset of the deferred tax liability was recorded to additional paid-in capital.

 Service Sales. Services sales, which includes freight for last-mile logistics services, increased by 116.3 million to 159.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in logistics revenue was due to higher sales volumes shipped to last-mile logistics customers as well as a full quarter of contribution from Hi-Crush.

This was partially offset by a decrease in utility and royalty expense over the period. 
 Cost of sales (excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion expense) related to services increased by 98.9 million to 136.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 37.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity to date have been capital contributions from our owners, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our previous term loan credit facilities, and our previous asset-based loan credit facilities. Going forward, we expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flows from operations, availability under our 2023 ABL Credit Facility as amended (as defined below under Debt Agreements ), borrowings under our 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility as amended (as defined below under Debt Agreements ), or any other credit facility we enter into in the future and proceeds from any future issuances of debt or equity securities. We expect our primary use of capital will be for payment of any dividends to our stockholders and for investing in our business, specifically for construction of the Dune Express, and acquisition of fit-for-purpose equipment for our trucking fleet used in our logistics platform. In addition, we have routine facility upgrades and additional ancillary capital expenditures associated with, among other things, contractual obligations and working capital obligations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of 58.3 million, 74.8 million of availability under the 2023 ABL Credit Facility, and 100.0 million of DDT Loans (as defined below under Debt Agreements). Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 78.6 million.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 185.6 million and 213.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily attributable to increased cost of sales (excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion expense) of 340.4 million as well as an increase in selling, general and administrative expense of 45.7 million. The increase was partially offset by a 311.8 million increase in revenues. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was 429.8 million and 245.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to 142.2 million spent on the Hi-Crush Transaction as well as capital spending at the Kermit and Monahans facilities, Dune Express and logistics assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was 112.6 million and 214.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This decrease is primarily related to 303.4 million of initial IPO proceeds raised in September 30, 2023 as compared to September 30, 2024. This was offset by an increase of 198.5 million of net proceeds from borrowing related to our acquisition financing during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Capital Requirements 
 Our primary growth and technology initiatives include continued construction of the Dune Express and acquisition of fit-for-purpose equipment for our trucking fleet. Outside of our growth and technology initiatives, our business is not presently capital intensive in nature and only requires the maintenance of our facilities. In addition to capital expenditures, we have certain contractual long-term capital requirements associated with our lease, royalty payments and debt. See Note 7 - Leases , Note 8 - Debt and Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. Our current level of maintenance capital expenditures is expected to remain within our cash on hand and internally generated cash flow. 
 We intend to fund our capital requirements through our primary sources of liquidity, which include cash on hand and cash flows from operations and, if needed, availability under our 2023 ABL Credit Facility and borrowings under our 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility. 
 At any time that our Board declares a dividend to holders of our Common Stock, we currently expect such dividend to be paid from cash provided by operating activities. We do not expect to borrow funds to finance dividends on our Common Stock. The timing and amount of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board from time to time. 
 Debt Agreements 
 Deferred Cash Consideration Note

The ABL Amendment also added a new lender with a 25.0 million commitment, thus creating a new debt arrangement under ASC 470, Debt. The deferred financing costs and debt issuance cost will be amortized on a prospective basis over the term of the agreement. The maturity date of the ABL Credit Agreement was extended from February 22, 2028 to the earliest of (a) February 26, 2029; (b) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date for any portion of the Term Loan Debt; or (c) any date on which the aggregate Commitments terminate hereunder. 
 The ABL Amendment requires that if Availability is less than the greater of (i) 12.50 of the Borrowing Base and (ii) 12.5 million, Atlas LLC must maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 while a Covenant Trigger Period is in effect. 
 Under the ABL Amendment, Atlas LLC is permitted to make payments of dividends and distributions pursuant to certain limited exceptions and baskets set forth therein and otherwise generally subject to certain restrictions described therein, including that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) no loans and no more than 7.5 million in letters of credit that have not been cash collateralized are outstanding, and liquidity exceeds 30.0 million at all times during the 30 days prior to the date of the dividend or distribution; provided that if any loans are outstanding or outstanding letters of credit exceed 7.5 million and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then Atlas LLC is permitted to make payments of dividends and distributions if, (i) Specified Availability (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement) is higher than the greater of (a) 20.0 million and (b) 20 of the pro forma Borrowing Base then in effect and during the 30 days prior to the date of the dividend or distribution as if such dividend or distribution had been made at the beginning of such period, or if (ii) (a) Specified Availability is higher than the greater of (x) 15.0 million and (y) 15 of the pro forma Borrowing Base then in effect and during the 30 days prior to the date of the dividend or distributions as if such dividend or distribution had been made at the beginning of such period and (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement), as calculated on a pro forma basis, is greater than 1.00 to 1.00, as provided under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement. Additionally, Atlas LLC may make additional payments of dividends and distributions in qualified equity interests and may make Permitted Tax Distributions (as defined under the 2023 ABL Credit Agreement). 
 Other Indebtedness 
 The Company has other indebtedness of 4.7 million of equipment finance notes as of September 30, 2024. There was de minimis interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These equipment finance notes have terms ending in November 2024 through August 2026 and interest rates ranging from 1.99 to 8.45 . 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and related estimates previously disclosed in our Annual Report, except in connection with the recently completed Hi-Crush Transaction (described below under Business Combination and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. Refer to the accounting policies discussed in the notes to our Financial Statements under Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Property, Plant and Equipment, Including Depreciation and Depletion 
 In order to calculate depreciation of our fixed assets, other than plant facilities and mine development costs, we use the best estimated useful lives at the time the asset is placed into service. 
 Mining property and development costs, including plant facilities directly associated with mining properties, are amortized using the units of production method on estimated measures of tons of in-place reserves. The impact to reserve estimates is recognized on a prospective basis. Drilling and related costs are capitalized for deposits where proven and probable reserves exist. These activities are directed at obtaining additional information on the deposit or converting non-reserve minerals to proven and probable reserves, with the benefit being realized over a period greater than one year. At a minimum, we will assess the useful lives and residual values of all long-lived assets on an annual basis to determine if adjustments are required. The actual reserve life may differ from the assumptions we have made about the estimated reserve life. 
 We review property, plant and equipment for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If such a review should indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the Company will reduce the carrying amount of such assets to fair value.

Emerging Growth Company Status 
 Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), we meet the definition of an emerging growth company, which allows us to have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. We have elected to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. 
 Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our Financial Statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods under Section 107 of the JOBS Act and that will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act. 
 Business Combinations 
 We allocate the purchase price of any business we acquire to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows, relief-from-royalty method, with or without method, or multi-period excess earnings method. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets, as well as any contingent consideration that provides for additional consideration to be paid to the seller if certain future conditions are met. These estimates are reviewed during the 12-month measurement period and adjusted as soon as the necessary information becomes available but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. The purchase price in the Hi-Crush Transaction includes a holdback, which is measured at fair value. The holdback is subject to increases or reductions based on changes in the estimated net working capital amounts compared to the final settlement of the net working capital and other customary purchase price adjustments. The holdback amount is based on management's best estimate as of September 30, 2024 and may be subject to further adjustments. This amount is recorded in other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion on our recently completed acquisition of Hi-Crush, see Note 3 - Hi-Crush Transaction , to the accompanying Financial Statements. 
 Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets 
 We assess our goodwill and acquired intangible assets for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or acquired intangible assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment charge that reduces our earnings. We perform our qualitative assessments of the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic, industry, market or any other factors that have a significant bearing on fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on subjective, judgmental assessments of projected revenue growth, pricing, gross profit rates, SG A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates. For further discussion on our recently completed acquisition, see Note 4 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets and Note 6 - Property, Plant, and Equipment , to the accompanying Financial Statements.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our business is subject to various types of market risks that include interest rate risks, market demand risks, commodity pricing risks, credit risks and inflation risks. Our risk exposure related to these items has not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 As disclosed in Note 3 - Hi Crush Transaction in the notes to the accompanying Financial Statements, we acquired Hi-Crush and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries on March 5, 2024, and its total revenues constituted approximately 53 and 47 of total revenues as shown on our Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The total assets of Hi-Crush acquired in the Hi-Crush Transaction constituted approximately 31 of total assets as shown on our Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024. We excluded Hi-Crush s disclosure controls and procedures that are subsumed by its internal control over financial reporting from the scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. This exclusion is in accordance with the guidance issued by the Staff of the SEC that an assessment of a recently acquired business s internal controls may be omitted from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. As part of the Company s ongoing integration activities, the Company s financial reporting controls and procedures are in the process of being implemented with respect to the acquired operations. Atlas and Hi-Crush used separate accounting systems through September 30, 2024. The Financial Statements presented in this Report were prepared using information obtained from these separate accounting systems. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting .

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 On July 2, 2024, Patrick Ayers, a purported shareholder (the Plaintiff), filed a derivative and class action complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain current and former directors of the Company and certain of the Company s affiliates. The complaint asserts claims of breach of fiduciary duty related to the corporate reorganization that changed the Company s Up-C structure to a customary C corporation. The complaint seeks unspecified damages from the defendants for the plaintiff individually and on behalf of the Company and other former Class A common stockholders as well as an award of attorneys fees and costs. We dispute these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against these claims. 
 In addition to the matter above, we are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, audits, and governmental investigations incidental to our business, including putative class actions, collective actions, employment, commercial claims and other matters. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable, based on currently available facts and our current insurance coverages, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are not aware of any material legal proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report.

Exhibit 95.1 
 Mine Safety Disclosures 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). 
 Mine Safety Information. Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation that describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining operator must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, may be reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the applicable MSHA District or the MSHA inspector(s) assigned. 
 The following table details the total number of, and the proposed dollar assessment for, violations, citations and orders issued by MSHA during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 upon periodic inspection of our mine facilities in accordance with the referenced sections of the Mine Act:

(1) Citations received from MSHA under Section 104 of the Mine Act for violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard. 

(2) Orders issued by MSHA under Section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 

(3) Citations and orders issued by MSHA under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act for an unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. 

(4) Violations deemed by MSHA to be flagrant under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 

(5) Orders issued by MSHA under Section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger (as defined by MSHA) existed. 

(6) Amounts included are the total dollar value of proposed assessments received from MSHA from July 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024, regardless of whether the assessment has been challenged or appealed. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are sometimes reduced in severity and amount, and sometimes dismissed.
