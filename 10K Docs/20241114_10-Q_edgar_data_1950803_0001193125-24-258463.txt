 investments as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). The 1940 Act classifies investments based on the level of control that the Company maintains in a particular portfolio company.

 of its limited liability company interests Shares in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the Private Offering, the Company has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, subscription agreements with investors (each, a Subscription Agreement ). 
 The organizational meeting of the Board of Directors (the Board of the Company was held on January 11, 2023. On January 4, 2023, the Advisor contributed of capital to the Company in exchange for shares of the Company s Shares. There were no operations prior to April 3, 2023 (commencement of operations). 

in the foregoing fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company may have investments that contain payment-in-kind

 PIK provisions. PIK income, computed at the contractual rate specified in the Company investment agreement, is added to the principal balance of the investment and collected upon repayment of the outstanding principal, and recorded as interest income on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company prospectively ceases recognition of PIK income and the associated principal balance if such amounts and balances are deemed to be doubtful of collection. For investments with PIK income, the Company calculates interest income accruals based on the principal balance including any PIK. 

 When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual
 status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest is reversed through interest income. To maintain the Company s status as a RIC, this non-cash
 source of income must be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected cash. 

 For the Company s secured borrowings, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within interest income and the interest earned by the counterparty is recorded within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 

million in gross proceeds from the issuance and sale of Shares, excluding Shares purchased by the Advisor and by the Company s directors and officers. Following such time, such organizational cost payments shall be subject to recoupment by the Advisor to the extent that such recoupment would not cause the Company to exceed the expense cap as outlined in the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement. During 2023, the Company received over million in gross proceeds from the issuance and sale of Shares. Any Expense Payments (as defined below) will be subject to recoupment by the Advisor in accordance with the below-described limitations and provisions to the extent that such recoupment would not cause the Company to exceed the Expense Cap. 
 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

of its gross income for such year from certain types of qualifying income, and distribute to its shareholders at least of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the Code (which includes, among other things, dividends, taxable interest and the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as reduced by certain deductible expenses). 
 In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year
 period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t incur any excise tax. 
 The Company s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to continue qualifying for treatment as a RIC and can limit the Company s ability to continue qualifying as such. An adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS or a change in law might affect the Company s ability to qualify or be eligible for such treatment. 
 If, in any year, the Company were to fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the Code and were ineligible to or did not otherwise cure such failure, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal corporate tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and, when such income is distributed, shareholders would be subject to further tax on such distributions to the extent of the Company s current or accumulated earnings and profits. 

The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes 
 ASC Topic 740 ). ASC Topic 740 provides
 guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not 
 to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not
 threshold that would result in a tax benefit or expense to the Company would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. There were no material unrecognized tax benefits or unrecognized tax liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions through September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t incur any interest or penalties. 
 The Company s federal tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three fiscal years after they are filed. Tax year 2023 is open to examination. 

million of gross proceeds, along with borrowings under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, as defined below, to purchase the Initial Portfolio. SPV Facility I purchased the Initial Portfolio pursuant to the terms of a Participation and Assignment Agreement by and between SPV Facility I and the Seller (the Initial Portfolio Transfer Agreement ). 
 The Initial Portfolio was comprised of U.S. dollar-denominated investments that the Company believes reflected attractive spreads and fundamentals as compared to the broader direct lending market and provided the Company with a sound foundation for the start of its business. The investments and unfunded obligations in the Initial Portfolio were consistent with the Company s investment objectives and the investment requirements set forth under the 1940 Act. 
 The aggregate purchase price (the Purchase Price for the Initial Portfolio was million, which was equal to the sum of the fair values of each asset and unfunded commitment in the Initial Portfolio as of the time immediately prior to closing under the Initial Portfolio Transfer Agreement. For purposes of determining the Purchase Price, the assets and unfunded commitments in the Initial Portfolio were valued as of February 28, 2023 by an independent third-party valuation firm. In connection with the closing under the Initial Portfolio Transfer Agreement and the acquisition of the Initial Portfolio, the Advisor conducted certain valuation procedures to confirm whether there had been any material changes to the fair value of the investments and obligations in the Initial Portfolio since February 28, 2023 and adjusted the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of the Initial Portfolio Transfer Agreement to reflect the fair value of the investments and obligations in the Initial Portfolio as of the time immediately prior to closing under the Initial Portfolio Transfer Agreement. 
 Advisory Agreement 

Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor manages the Company s day-to-day

 operations and provides the Company with investment advisory and management services. The Advisor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of StepStone Group Private Debt AG (f/k/a Swiss Capital Alternative Investments AG), which is a member of the StepStone Group LP StepStone Group ). StepStone Group makes certain personnel and resources available to the Advisor pursuant to the terms of a resource sharing agreement (the Resource Sharing Agreement ). 

 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Advisor fees for investment management services consisting of a base management fee (the Base Management Fee and an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee ). 
 Any of the fees payable to the Advisor under the Advisory Agreement for any partial month or calendar quarter is appropriately prorated. The Advisor may agree to temporarily defer or permanently waive, in whole or in part, the Base Management Fee and/or the Incentive Fee. Any portion of a deferred fee payable to the Advisor and not paid over to the Advisor with respect to any month, calendar quarter or year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid over in any such other month prior to the termination of Advisory Agreement, as the Advisor may determine upon written notice to the Company. 
 The Base Management Fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Company s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month, commencing with the first calendar day of the first full calendar month following the date of the Company s election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, the value of the Company s net assets means the Company s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a Base Management Fee of and , respectively. For the period from April 3, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, the Advisor permanently waived the Base Management Fee. 

annualized) (the Hurdle Rate ), subject to a catch up feature (as described below). 
 For this purpose, Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance) such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company (or its wholly-owned subsidiaries) receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s and its subsidiaries operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses and fees paid to the Advisor under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee and any shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees), net of any expense waivers or expense payments by the Advisor. Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments with payment-in-kind

 interest and zero-coupon
 securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 The calculation of the Income Incentive Fee for each quarter is as follows: 

No Income Incentive Fee will be payable to the Advisor in any calendar quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Hurdle Rate; 

of the dollar amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than or equal to in any calendar quarter annualized) will be payable to the Advisor. This portion of the Company s Income Incentive Fee that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than or equal to is referred to as the catch up and is intended to provide the Advisor with an Incentive Fee of on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income when the Company s Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income reaches annualized) on net assets in any calendar quarter; and 

of the dollar amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds annualized) on net assets in any calendar quarter will be payable to the Advisor once the Hurdle Rate and catch-up
 have been achieved of the Company s Pre-Incentive
 Fee Net Investment Income thereafter will be allocated to the Advisor). 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred Income Incentive Fee of and , respectively. For the period from April 3, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, the Advisor permanently waived the Income Incentive Fee. 
 The second part of the Incentive Fee, referred to as the Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee, is an incentive fee on capital gains and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement). This fee will equal of the Company s incentive fee capital gains, which will equal the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from the effective date of the Advisory Agreement, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from effective date of the Advisory Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee. 
 The Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee is subject to calculation under the Advisory Agreement and under U.S. GAAP (i.e., assuming hypothetical liquidation). The U.S. GAAP calculation is computed based on realized gains and unrealized gains, net of realized and unrealized losses. 
 Each year, the fee paid for the Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee for all prior periods. The Company will accrue, but will not pay, a Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee would be owed to the Advisor if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued a Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee of and , respectively, under U.S. GAAP. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from April 3, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, no Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee was accrued. 

on an annualized basis of the Company s net assets. The Administration Fee is calculated based on the Company s month-end
 net NAV (as of the close of business on the last calendar day of the applicable month) and is payable monthly in arrears. The Administration Fee is an expense paid out of the Company s net assets. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an Administration Fee of and , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from April 3, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, the Company incurred an Administration Fee of and , respectively. 
 Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement 

The Company entered into an Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Limitation Agreement with the Advisor for an initial one-year
 term beginning on the initial closing date for subscriptions, April 3, 2023, for Shares and ending on the 
 anniversary thereof (the Limitation Period subject to annual renewal by the mutual agreement of the Advisor and the Company. On November 8, 2023, the Company and the Advisor amended and restated the Expense Limitation Agreement (the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement ). Under the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement, which is in effect for the same Limitation Period, unless extended by the Company and the Advisor pursuant to its terms, the Advisor agrees that it will pay, absorb or reimburse the Company s aggregate monthly Other Operating Expenses (as defined below) on the Company s behalf (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include any Other Operating Expenses incurred prior to the effective date of the Advisory Agreement) (each such payment, absorption or reimbursement, a Required Expense Payment ), such that the aggregate monthly Other Operating Expenses borne by the Company during the Limitation Period shall not exceed , on an annualized basis, of the Company s month-end
 net assets (the Expense Cap ). For any month in which the Company s aggregate monthly Other Operating Expenses exceed the Expense Cap, the Advisor shall make a Required Expense Payment to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess. The Advisor may also directly pay expenses on behalf of the Company and waive reimbursement under the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement. Other Operating Expenses shall include all of the Company s operating expenses, including O O Expenses, but shall exclude Specified Expenses (as defined below). O O Expenses shall include all of the fees, costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and obligations incurred in relation to or in connection with the establishment of the Company, the marketing and offering of the Shares (including, among other things, legal, accounting, subscription processing and filing fees and expenses and other expenses pertaining to this offering), and the establishment, organization and creation of the operational structure of the Company and its special purpose vehicle subsidiaries, including travel, lodging, meals, entertainment, legal, accounting, regulatory compliance, fees of professional advisors, printing, postage, regulatory and tax filing fees, and other costs of establishment. 
 Voluntary Expense Support

At such times as the Advisor determines, the Advisor may also elect to pay or reimburse certain additional fees and expenses of the Company on the Company s behalf, including all or any portion of a Specified Expense (each such payment or reimbursement, a Voluntary Expense Payment and, together with a Required Expense Payment, the Expense Payments provided that no portion of a Voluntary Expense Payment will be used to pay any interest expense or shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees of the Company. In making a Voluntary Expense Payment, the Advisor will designate, as it deems necessary or advisable, what type of expense it is paying. 
 Company Obligation
. The Company had no obligation to reimburse or pay the Advisor for any Expense Payment until the Company received at least million in gross proceeds from the sale of Shares in the agreement (the Offering Proceeds Threshold ), following which time, such Expense Payments were subject to recoupment by the Advisor in accordance with Excess Expenses below to the extent that such recoupment would not cause the Company to exceed the Expense Cap. Calculation of the Offering Proceeds Threshold shall exclude gross proceeds from Shares in the agreement purchased by the Advisor and by the Company s directors and officers. 
 Specified Expenses
. The Expense Cap applies only to the Company s aggregate monthly Other Operating Expenses, which excludes Specified Expenses. Specified Expenses include: (i) the base management fee under the Advisory Agreement; (ii) all fees and expenses charged by the non-affiliated
 investment managers of the Underlying Funds and other investments in which the Company invests (including management fees, performance or incentive fees and redemption or withdrawal fees, however titled or structured); (iii) the incentive fee under the Advisory Agreement; (iv) transactional costs and expenses associated with the acquisition and disposition of the Company s investments (whether or not consummated), including due diligence costs, legal costs and brokerage commissions, and sourcing and servicing or related fees incurred by the Company in connection with the servicing by non-affiliated
 third parties of, and other related administrative services provided by non-affiliated
 third parties with respect to, the Company s investments; (v) interest payments incurred on borrowings by the Company or its subsidiaries; (vi) fees and expenses incurred in connection with any credit facility obtained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including any expenses for acquiring ratings related to the credit facilities; (vii) distribution and shareholder servicing fees, as applicable; (viii) taxes; and (ix) extraordinary expenses resulting from events and transactions that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence, including, without limitation, costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or similar proceeding, indemnification expenses, and expenses in connection with holding and/or soliciting proxies for all annual and other meetings of the Company s shareholders.

 or less of the portfolio company s voting securities and controlled when the Company owns more than of the portfolio company s voting securities and/or has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. The 1940 Act also classifies investments further based on the level of ownership that the Company maintains in a particular portfolio company. As defined in the 1940 Act, a company is generally deemed as non-affiliated 
 when the Company owns less than of a portfolio company s voting securities and affiliated when the Company owns or more of a portfolio company s voting securities (and is not otherwise controlled ). Under the 1940 Act, non-affiliated
 investments are defined as investments that are neither controlled investments nor affiliated investments. Detailed information with respect to the Company s non-controlled,
 non-affiliated;
 non-controlled,
 affiliated; and controlled investments is contained in the consolidated financial statements, including the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. The information in the tables below is presented on an aggregate portfolio basis, without regard to whether they are non-controlled,
 non-affiliated;
 non-controlled,
 affiliated; or controlled investments. 
 Direct Loans 

The Company s direct loans primarily include secured debt (including first lien senior secured and second lien senior secured), but may also include unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt) and mezzanine loans, as well as broadly syndicated loans and club deals (generally investments made by a small group of investment firms). First lien senior secured debt has first claim to any underlying collateral of a loan, second lien senior secured debt is secured but subordinated in payment and/or lower in lien priority to first lien holders, and unitranche loans are secured loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt into one tranche of debt, generally in a first lien position. In connection with a direct loan, the Company may receive non-cash
 income features, including PIK interest and OID. 

 Collateralized Loan Obligation Warehouses 

A Collateralized Loan Obligation Warehouse CLO Warehouse is an entity organized for the purpose of holding syndicated bank loans, also known as leveraged loans, prior to the issuance of securities from that same vehicle. During the warehouse period, a CLO Warehouse will secure investments and build a portfolio of primarily leveraged loans and other debt obligations. The warehouse period terminates when the collateralized loan obligation vehicle issues various tranches of securities to the market. At this time, financing through the issuance of debt and equity securities is used to repay the bank financing. 
 The fair value of a CLO Warehouse is determined by adding the excess spread (accrued interest plus interest received less financing cost) to the CLO Warehouse equity contribution made by the Company, discounted to present value, unless the Advisor determines that the securitization will not be achieved, in which case, the fair value of a CLO Warehouse will be established based on the fair value of the underlying bank loan positions which are valued in a manner consistent with the Advisor s valuation policy and procedures. CLO warehouses can be exposed to credit events, mark to market changes, rating agency downgrades and financing cost changes. Changes in the fair value of a CLO Warehouse are reported in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers in the consolidated statements of operations.

Private Credit Funds 

Private credit funds are investment funds that primarily invest in or acquire non-marketable
 private credit investments. Investments in private credit funds are reported in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities generally equal to the Company s proportionate share of the net assets of the private credit funds, as represented by its reported capital account balance provided by the general partner or investment manager of the private credit funds. 

 Private credit funds normally do not have readily available market prices and therefore will be fair valued according to the Valuation Procedures at each determination date. Ordinarily, the fair value of the Company s investment in a private credit fund is based on the NAV of the investment reported by its investment manager Investment Manager ). If the Advisor determines that the most recent NAV reported by the Investment Manager does not represent fair value or if the Investment Manager fails to report a NAV to the Company, a fair value determination is made by the Advisor in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. In making that determination, the Advisor will consider whether it is appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value such investment at the NAV last reported by its Investment Manager, or whether to adjust such NAV to reflect a premium or discount (adjusted NAV). The NAVs or adjusted NAVs are net of management fees and performance/incentive fees (carried interest) payable by the private credit fund investees pursuant to their respective organizational documents. 

and 
 , respectively, to private credit funds.

Distributions received from private credit funds occur at irregular intervals and the exact timing of the distributions cannot be determined. The classification of distributions received in cash or in-kind, including return of capital, realized gains, interest income and dividend income, is based on information received from the Investment Manager of the private credit funds. Dividend income and interest income are recorded on a trade date and accrual basis.

 Discretionary Share Repurchase Program 

 Beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company commenced a share repurchase program, in which the Company intends, subject to market conditions and the discretion of the Board, to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to of the Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest the Company s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect the Company s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. In the event the amount of Shares tendered exceeds the repurchase offer amount, Shares will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4
 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and the 1940 Act. All Shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Shares. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase Shares in any particular quarter, the Company expects to repurchase Shares using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter (the Valuation Date ). If shareholders tender Shares in a tender offer with a Valuation Date that is within the 12-month
 period following the initial issue date of their tendered Shares, the Company may repurchase such Shares subject to an early repurchase deduction of of the aggregate NAV of the Shares repurchased (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. 
Shares may be sold to certain feeder vehicles primarily created to hold the Shares that in turn offer interests in such feeder vehicles to non-U.S. persons. For such feeder vehicles and similar arrangements in certain markets, the Company may not apply the Early Repurchase Deduction to the feeder vehicles or underlying investors, often because of administrative or systems limitations. 

In the event that any shareholder fails to maintain a minimum balance of of the Company s Shares, the Company may repurchase all of the Shares held by that shareholder at the repurchase price in effect on the date the Company determines that the shareholder has failed to meet the minimum balance, less any Early Repurchase Deduction. In the alternative, the Company reserves the right to reduce the number of Shares requested to be repurchased from a shareholder so that the required account balance is maintained. Minimum account repurchases will apply even in the event that the failure to meet the minimum balance is caused solely by a decline in the Company s NAV. Minimum account repurchases are subject to an Early Repurchase Deduction. 
 On February 1, 2024, the Company offered to purchase up to shares of its Shares at a purchase price equal to the NAV per Share as of March 31, 2024 (the February 2024 Tender Offer ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase for the February 2024 Tender Offer. The February 2024 Tender Offer expired on February 29, 2024 and Shares were tendered by the shareholders in connection with the February 2024 Tender Offer. 
 On May 1, 2024, the Company offered to purchase up to shares of its Shares at a purchase price equal to the NAV per Share as of June 30, 2024 (the May 2024 Tender Offer ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase for the May 2024 Tender Offer. The May 2024 Tender Offer expired on May 29, 2024 and Shares were validly tendered by the shareholders in connection with the May 2024 Tender Offer. On July 26, 2024, the Company determined that, as of June 30, 2024, the NAV per Share was per Share. Based on such NAV per Share, the aggregate purchase price for the Shares accepted for re
purchase by the Company in the May 2024 Tender Offer equaled . 
 On August 1, 2024, the Company offered to re
purchase up to Shares at a purchase price equal to the NAV per Share as of September 30, 2024 (the August 2024 
Tender Offer ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase for the August 2024 Tender Offer. The August 2024 Tender Offer expired on August 30, 2024 and Shares were validly tendered by the shareholders in connection with the August 2024 Tender Offer. On October 25, 2024, the Company determined that, as of September 30, 2024, the NAV per Share was per Share. Based on such NAV per Share, the aggregate purchase price for the Shares accepted for re
purchase by the Company in the August 2024 Tender Offer equaled .

Table of Contents 

Overview The Company is a non-diversified, externally managed closed-end management investment company that was organized to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns mainly by investing in various credit-related strategies. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. We are a non-exchange traded, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. We use the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration, whose shares are intended to be sold by the BDC monthly on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to the BDC s monthly NAV per share. In our perpetual-life structure, we may offer investors an opportunity to repurchase their shares on a quarterly basis at NAV, but we are not obligated to offer to repurchase any Shares in any particular quarter. We believe that our perpetual nature enables us to execute a patient and opportunistic strategy and be able to invest across different market environments. This may reduce the risk of the Company being a forced seller of assets in market downturns compared to non-perpetual funds. While we may consider a liquidity event at any time in the future, we currently do not intend to undertake a liquidity event, and we are not obligated by our Limited Liability Company Agreement or otherwise to effect a liquidity event at any time. The Company s investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation, mainly by investing in various credit-related strategies. The Company intends to primarily use a multi-lender approach to achieve its investment objectives, whereby the Advisor utilizes a variety of non-bank or corporate lenders Lending Sources to source investment opportunities for the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its investment objectives. Under normal circumstances, we will invest at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in Private Credit, primarily through our lending strategy and underlying funds strategy, each as more fully discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as otherwise disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we may modify or waive our investment objectives and any of our investment policies, restrictions, strategies, and techniques without prior notice and without shareholder approval. However, absent requisite shareholder approval under the 1940 Act, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. If we change our 80 Private Credit test, we will provide shareholders with at least 60 days advance notice of such change. The Company s investments in underlying funds are primarily made on a fund-of-funds basis in private investment funds and investment vehicles that are excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which are managed by non-affiliated third-party managers that operate various Private Credit-related strategies. Some of these underlying funds may from time to time sell seasoned loans to the Company or other third parties. The managers or general partners of the underlying funds may impose management fees or performance-based fees, a proportionate share of which will be borne by the Company and, indirectly, its shareholders. With respect to investments approved by the Advisor that are sourced by Lending Sources or through underlying funds, the Company may be required to pay an origination or similar fee in connection with making such investment, as well as any ongoing fees for administrative services provided by the Lending Sources to the Company with respect to such investments, which fees will be indirectly borne by the Company s shareholders and are in addition to the fees charged to the underlying funds by their managers or general partners. The Advisor expects that the direct loans to which we will have exposure will generally be made to middle-market companies, which we define as companies with an annual EBITDA of approximately 10 million to 100 million. The loans in which we expect to invest will generally pay floating interest rates based on a variable base rate. The secured debt (including first lien senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) in which we will invest generally have stated terms of five to eight years, and the mezzanine, unsecured or subordinated debt investments that we may make will generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and five years. However, there is no limit on the maturity or duration of any security we may hold in our portfolio. Loans and securities purchased in the secondary market will generally have shorter remaining terms to maturity than newly issued investments. We expect most of our debt investments will be unrated. Our debt investments may also be rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and, in such case, generally will carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or lower than BBB by Standard Poor s Ratings Services). We expect that our unrated debt investments will generally have credit quality consistent with below investment grade securities. The Company generates revenues primarily in the form of interest income from debt investments it holds. In addition, the Company generates income from dividends or distributions of income on any direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of loans and equity securities and various other loan origination and other fees, including commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. As a BDC regulated under the 1940 Act, the Company is subject to certain limitations relating to co-investments and joint transactions with affiliates, which, in certain circumstances, likely may limit the Company s ability to make investments or enter into other transactions alongside other clients. The Advisor intends to apply for an exemptive order from the SEC that will permit the Company, 
 63 

Table of Contents 

among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Advisor and certain funds managed and controlled by the Advisor and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. There is no assurance that the co-investment exemptive order will be granted by the SEC. Please refer to Item 1. Business in our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 for more information on the Company and its investment objectives and strategy. We are externally managed by the Advisor, which manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and administrative services pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. We are not a subsidiary of, or consolidated with, the Advisor. The Advisor oversees (subject to the oversight of the Board) the management of our operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. Under the Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor a management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. The Advisor has also entered into the Resource Sharing Agreement with StepStone Group, under which certain designated employees of StepStone Group will provide services, including investment advisory, portfolio management and other services, to the Advisor. The Resource Sharing Agreement (i) provides the Company with access to deal flow generated by StepStone Group in the ordinary course of its business; and (ii) provides the Advisor with access to StepStone Group s investment professionals and non-investment employees. The Advisor is responsible for determining if the Company will participate in deal flow generated by StepStone Group. StepStone Group will also make available its premises, facilities and systems to the Advisor in order for the Advisor to conduct its daily operations. In return for personnel provided and services rendered under the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Advisor will pay StepStone Group on a cost-plus basis. By virtue of the Resource Sharing Agreement, our Advisor is served by experienced investment professionals within StepStone Group, including the members of the Investment Committee, which has primary responsibility for portfolio management regarding the Company s investment portfolio. The Advisor also serves as the Company s administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement and performs certain administrative, accounting and other services for the Company. In consideration of these administrative services, the Company pays the Advisor the Administration Fee in an amount up to 0.30 on an annualized basis of the Company s net assets. The Administration Fee is calculated based on the Company s month-end NAV (as of the close of business on the last calendar day of the applicable month) and payable monthly in arrears. The Administration Fee is an expense paid out of the Company s net assets. The Advisor may delegate or sub-contract certain of its services under the Administration Agreement to other entities, including a sub-administrator, and has done so as described below. From the proceeds of the Administration Fee, the Advisor pays the Sub-Administrator a sub-administration fee to provide certain outsourced administration and outsourced accounting services for the Company. The Advisor has engaged SGEAIL to act as our sub-advisor pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement to provide certain ongoing, non-discretionary investment advice and services to the Advisor in regard to the Advisor s management of the Company. Private Offering We are conducting the continuous Private Offering of Shares in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and/or pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, in connection with which we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, Subscription Agreements with investors. Investors whose subscriptions for Shares are accepted by the Company will be admitted as members of the Company following payment of their capital contribution to the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Limited Liability Company Agreement. The Initial Closing of the Private Offering occurred on April 3, 2023, in connection with which we sold 741,800 Shares in exchange for gross proceeds of 18.5 million. We used the proceeds from the Initial Closing, along with borrowings under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, to purchase the Initial Portfolio on April 3, 2023, shortly prior to our election to be regulated as a BDC. As of September 30, 2024, we had sold an aggregate of 25,366,192 Shares in the Private Offering for total consideration of approximately 657.2 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had sold an aggregate of 12,701,718 Shares in the Private Offering for total consideration of approximately 327.3 million. These figures do not include any Shares issued in connection with the DRIP. Initial Portfolio Acquisition On April 3, 2023, shortly prior to our election to be regulated as a BDC, and in order to avoid the blind pool-aspects typically associated with the launch of a new fund, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, SPV Facility I, acquired the Initial Portfolio from the Seller, which comprised of a select portfolio of first lien, senior secured Private Credit investments in, and funding obligations to, well-established middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries. We used the proceeds from the Initial Closing, in 
 64

connection with which we received approximately 18.5 million of gross proceeds, along with borrowings under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, to purchase the Initial Portfolio. SPV Facility I purchased the Initial Portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Initial Portfolio Transfer Agreement. Key Components of Our Results of Operations Investments The Company s level of investment activity can, does, and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments the Company makes. Revenue The Company generates revenue primarily in the form of interest income, including PIK interest and OID, on debt investments it holds. In addition, the Company generates income from dividends or distributions of income on any direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. The secured debt (including first lien senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) in which the Company invests generally has stated terms of five to eight years, and the mezzanine, unsecured or subordinated debt investments that the Company may make will generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and five years. The Company s debt investments typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR. Interest on these debt investments is paid quarterly. In some instances, the Company receives payments on its debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, the Company may receive repayments of some of its debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments is expected to fluctuate significantly from period to period. The Company s portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. The Company may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Distributions received from private credit funds occur at irregular intervals and the exact timing of the distributions cannot be determined. The classification of distributions received in cash or in-kind, including return of capital, realized gains, interest income and dividend income, is based on information received from the Investment Manager of the private credit funds. Dividend income and interest income are recorded on a trade date and accrual basis. Expenses The Advisor bears all of its own costs incurred in providing investment advisory services to the Company. As described below, however, the Company bears all other expenses related to its investment program. The Advisor provides or arranges for certain administrative services to be provided to the Company. Among those services are: providing office space, adequate personnel, and communications and other facilities necessary for administration of the Company, performing certain administrative functions to support the Company and its service providers, supporting the Board and providing it with information, providing accounting and legal services in support of the Company, compliance testing services (not including any compliance services performed by an outsourced Chief Compliance Officer) analyzing the value of the Company s assets, and reviewing and arranging for payment of the Company s expenses and other support services. Such administrative services are included in the Administration Fee. In addition to the services above, the Advisor is responsible for overseeing the Sub-Administrator.

The Company will also bear certain administrative costs. We reimburse the Advisor, subject to the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement, for amounts paid or costs borne that properly constitute Company expenses as set forth in the Administration Agreement and Advisory Agreement or otherwise. We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. Portfolio and Investment Activity As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 530 investments in 272 portfolio companies across 69 industries. Based on fair value as of September 30, 2024, 100 of the Company s debt portfolio was invested in debt bearing a floating interest rate. The weighted average interest rate across the Company s portfolio investments was approximately 11.3 as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 231 investments in 150 portfolio companies across 55 industries. Based on fair value as of December 31, 2023, 100 of the Company s debt portfolio was invested in debt bearing a floating interest rate. The weighted average interest rate across the Company s portfolio investments was approximately 11.1 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio median EBITDA was 53.0 million. The portfolio median EBITDA is based on the most recently reported trailing twelve-month EBITDA received from the portfolio company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s median loan-to-value LTV was 43.0 . LTV is calculated as net debt through each respective investment tranche in which the Company holds an investment divided by value of underlying collateral of the portfolio company. Portfolio Asset Quality We utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each portfolio company and to monitor our expected level of returns on each of our investments in relation to our expectations for the portfolio company. The investment rating system takes into consideration various factors, including each investment s expected level of returns, the collectability of our debt investments and the ability to receive a return of the invested capital in our equity investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants, the portfolio company s future outlook and other factors that are deemed to be significant to the portfolio company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio had no investments on non-accrual status. The operating results of our portfolio companies are impacted by changes in the broader fundamentals of the United States economy. In periods during which the United States economy contracts, it is likely that the financial results of small to mid-sized companies, like those in which we invest, could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements, to an increase in defaults on our debt investments or in realized losses on our investments and to difficulty in maintaining historical dividend payment rates and unrealized appreciation on our equity investments. Consequently, we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by future economic cycles or other conditions, which could also have a negative impact on our future results.

Net increases (decreases) in net assets resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, comparisons of net changes in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. The unrealized gains for three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 were largely due to increases in NAV on private credit fund investments.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income was driven by the Company s deployment of capital and increasing invested balance of investments. The size of the Company s investment portfolio at fair value was 1,205 million as of September 30, 2024 and, as of such date, all of the Company s debt investments were income-producing. For the period from April 3, 2023 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2023, total investment income was driven by the Company s deployment of capital and increasing invested balance of investments. The size of the Company s investment portfolio at fair value was 448.0 million as of September 30, 2023 and, as of such date, all of the Company s debt investments were income-producing. Interest income on the Company s debt investments is dependent on the composition and credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, the Company expects the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Company s debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments.

Expense support payments include operating expenses and organizational costs. Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and intends each year to qualify and be eligible to be treated as such, so that it generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its net investment income or net short-term or long-term capital gains, that are distributed (or deemed distributed, as described below) to shareholders. In order to qualify and be eligible for such treatment, the Company must meet certain asset diversification tests, derive at least 90 of its gross income for such year from certain types of qualifying income, and distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the Code (which includes, among other things, dividends, taxable interest and the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as reduced by certain deductible expenses). In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not incur any excise tax. The Company s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to continue qualifying for treatment as a RIC and can limit the Company s ability to continue qualifying as such. The tax treatment of certain of the Company s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to RICs is uncertain. An adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS or a change in law might affect the Company s ability to qualify or be eligible for such treatment. If, in any year, the Company were to fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the Code and were ineligible to or did not otherwise cure such failure, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal corporate tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and, when such income is distributed, shareholders would be subject to further tax on such distributions to the extent of the Company s current or accumulated earnings and profits. The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ). ASC Topic 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in consolidated financial statements. ASC Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense or tax benefit in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. There were no material unrecognized tax benefits or unrecognized tax liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s federal tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three fiscal years after they are filed. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company generates cash from the net proceeds from the Private Offering and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from its investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of its investments. The Company also funds a portion of its investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, and intends to continue to do so during times prior to when the Company has fully invested the proceeds of any closing on Shares in the Private Offering. The Company s primary use of cash will be to make investments in portfolio companies, payments of Company expenses, payments of cash distributions to shareholders and repurchases of Shares under the Company s discretionary share repurchase program. We believe that our available borrowing capacity under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, the BMO SPV II Credit Facility and the Wells Fargo SPV III Credit Facility, our anticipated cash flows from the net proceeds from the Private Offering, our anticipated cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations, including to fund our unfunded commitment obligations. Cash Flows As of September 30, 2024 we had 25.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used (576.9) million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding of portfolio investments of (792.0) million, partially offset by repayment of portfolio investments of 166.0 million, and other operating activities of 49.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 583.2 million during the period, which was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of Shares in the Private Offering of 330.0 million and borrowings of 669.4 million under our financing arrangements, partially offset by distributions paid, including repurchase of shares of (13.1) million and repayments of borrowings, including debt issuance costs paid of (403.1) million.

As of December 31, 2023 we had 18.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. During the period from April 3, 2023 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2023, we used (548.4) million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding of portfolio investments of (600.5) million, partially offset by repayment of portfolio investments of 35.3 million, and other operating activities of 16.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 567.3 million during the period, which was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of Shares in the Private Offering of 333.7 million and borrowings of 312.1 million under our financing arrangements, partially offset by distributions paid of (7.0) million and repayments of borrowings of (71.5) million. Financing Transactions The Company intends to utilize leverage (including through the establishment of wholly-owned financing subsidiaries), to finance its investments and operations. The amount of leverage that the Company employs will be subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act and the supervision of the Board. At the time of any proposed borrowing, the amount of leverage the Company employs will also depend on the Advisor s assessment of market and other factors. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, following approval from our initial shareholder of the reduced asset coverage requirements under Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, which approval became effective on January 21, 2023, we are currently permitted to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. For purposes of the 1940 Act, asset coverage means the ratio of (1) the total assets of a BDC, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to (2) the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness (plus, in the case of senior securities represented by preferred stock, the aggregate involuntary liquidation preference of such BDC s preferred stock). Under the 1940 Act, any shares of preferred stock that we may issue will constitute a senior security for purposes of the 150 asset coverage test. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio, as defined under the 1940 Act, was 232.2 and 231.2 , respectively. The Company intends to use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from certain financial institutions and the issuance of debt, as well as debt securitizations, and may form one or more wholly-owned financing subsidiaries in the future in connection therewith. The Company may also use leverage in the form of the issuance of preferred shares, but does not currently intend to do so, or by using reverse repurchase agreements or similar transactions and derivatives. The Company may use leverage for investments, working capital, expenses and general corporate purposes (including to pay dividends or distributions). In determining whether to borrow money or issue debt on behalf of the Company, the Advisor will analyze, as applicable, the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to the Company s investment outlook. Any such leverage, if incurred, would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings of 516,670,535 and 248,370,535, respectively. The Company may also from time to time enter into new credit facilities, increase the size of existing credit facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. MassMutual SPV I Facility On April 3, 2023, in connection with the acquisition of the Initial Portfolio, the Company, through SPV Facility I as borrower, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the MassMutual SPV I Facility with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company MassMutual ), as the administrative agent and facility servicer, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, the lenders made initial commitments of 200,000,000. On September 26, 2023, SPV Facility I and MassMutual amended the MassMutual SPV I Facility (the MassMutual First Amendment ). The MassMutual First Amendment, among other things, increased the aggregate commitments by the lenders to 250,000,000. Borrowings under the MassMutual SPV I Facility will generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 3-Month Term SOFR plus a margin of 3.25 , with a 1.0 floor on Term SOFR. The MassMutual SPV I Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of SPV Facility I and a pledge over 100 of the Company s equity interest in SPV Facility I. The MassMutual SPV I Facility requires payment of (a) a non-use fee during the 18-month availability period of 0.40 on the difference between the average daily outstanding balance under the facility relative to the maximum amount of commitments at such time, and (b) after the 18-month availability period until the stated maturity date, a utilization fee equal to the positive difference, if any, in respect of any period between (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued under the MassMutual SPV I Facility if the principal outstanding thereunder were equal to 75 of the maximum 
 69 

Table of Contents 

commitment amount in that period, and (ii) the amount of interest that actually accrued under the MassMutual SPV I Facility for such period on the loans advanced thereunder. The Advisor paid, on the Company s behalf, a customary upfront 1.25 commitment fee in connection with the MassMutual SPV I Facility, which amount was subject to reimbursement by the Company under the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement. The MassMutual SPV I Facility matures on March 31, 2033, unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an outstanding principal balance under the MassMutual SPV I Facility of 206,000,000 and 154,500,000, respectively.

BMO had made an initial commitment of 81,250,000 under the BMO SPV II Credit Facility, with an accordion provision to permit increases to the total facility amount up to 100,000,000, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. On July 3, 2023, SPV Facility II and BMO entered into an amendment (the BMO First Amendment to the BMO Loan and Security Agreement.

Atalaya Capital Management LP Effective April 19, 2024, the Company, through its subsidiary SPV Facility IV, may from time-to-time purchase or originate loans and sell a participation in all or a portion of such loans to Macquarie Bank Limited and its affiliates Macquarie ), and concurrently with entering into such participation arrangement, agree to repurchase, or otherwise pay for the termination of, within 90 days, such participation arrangement. SPV Facility IV may have obligations to repurchase assets arising from such transactions that collectively have an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of up to 100,000,000. In connection therewith, for repurchase transactions entered into by the Company, certain affiliates of Atalaya Capital Management LP will guarantee such repurchase transactions in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed 100,000,000 subject to certain terms and conditions. The agreement to guarantee such repurchases has a term of one year that can be extended on the consent of both parties. SPV Facility IV will pay the guarantors any accrued interest, whether in the form of cash or payment in kind in accordance with the underlying payment terms for each loan during the guaranty period, less any interest, fees, expenses, indemnification payments and other similar compensation or reimbursements paid, or accrued and unpaid, to Macquarie as required under the participation documents for such loan. The amounts paid to Macquarie are determined at the time of the transaction and there is no obligation of Macquarie or the Company to utilize this arrangement in any way. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into one secured borrowing in the amount of 6,435,000 with Macquarie. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s aggregate weighted average interest rate under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, the BMO SPV II Credit Facility and the Wells Fargo SPV III Credit Facility (the Lines of Credit amounted to 8.24 and 8.29 , respectively. The Company s aggregate daily average amount of borrowings under the Lines of Credit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 413,849,883 and 370,070,170, respectively. The Lines of Credit each include customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a minimum shareholders equity and asset coverage ratio, and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature. Distributions and Distribution Reinvestment We expect to pay regular quarterly distributions. Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Board, considering factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition and the requirements of Delaware law. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time. On March 14, 2024, the Board declared a distribution on the Shares payable on April 30, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2024 (the Q1 2024 Distribution ). The amount of the Q1 2024 Distribution equaled 0.65 per Share and was paid in cash or reinvested in additional Shares for shareholders participating in the Company s DRIP. 259,187 Shares were issued on January 1, 2024 in connection with the Company s DRIP for the Q4 2023 Distribution. On May 7, 2024, the Board declared a distribution on the Shares payable on July 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 28, 2024 (the Q2 2024 Distribution ). The amount of the Q2 2024 Distribution equaled 0.65 per Share and was paid in cash or reinvested in additional Shares for shareholders participating in the Company s DRIP. 283,784 Shares were issued on April 1, 2024 in connection with the Company s DRIP for the Q1 2024 Distribution. On August 8, 2024, the Board declared a distribution on the Shares payable on October 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2024 (the Q3 2024 Distribution ). The amount of the Q3 2024 Distribution equaled 0.65 per

Share and was paid in cash or reinvested in additional Shares for shareholders participating in the Company s DRIP. 298,382 Shares were issued on July 1, 2024 in connection with the Company s DRIP for the Q2 2024 Distribution. Our Board s discretion as to the payment of distributions will be directed, in substantial part, by its determination to cause us to comply with the RIC requirements. To maintain our treatment as a RIC, we generally are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our shareholders of at least 90 of our investment company taxable income. There is no assurance we will pay distributions in any particular amount, if at all. We may fund any distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, such as borrowings, return of capital or offering proceeds, and although we generally expect to fund distributions from cash flow from operations, we have not established limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. The extent to which we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations will depend on various factors, including the level of participation in our distribution reinvestment plan, how quickly we invest the proceeds from this and any future offering and the performance of our investments. Funding distributions from borrowings, return of capital or proceeds of the Private Offering will result in us having less funds available to acquire investments. As a result, the return investors realize on their investment may be reduced. Doing so may also negatively impact our ability to generate cash flows. Likewise, funding distributions from offering proceeds will dilute investors interest in us on a percentage basis and may impact the value of their investment especially if we sell these securities at prices less than the price an investor paid for their Shares. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from any available sources to make distributions. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the performance necessary to sustain our distributions or that we will be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all. The Advisor and its affiliates have no obligation to waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods. Consistent with the Code, shareholders will be notified of the source of our distributions. Our distributions may exceed our earnings and profits, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from the Private Offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes. The tax basis of Shares must be reduced by the amount of any return of capital distributions, which will result in an increase in the amount of any taxable gain (or a reduction in any deductible loss) on the sale of Shares. For a period of time following commencement of the Private Offering, which time period may be significant, we expect substantial portions of our distributions may be funded indirectly through the reimbursement of certain expenses by the Advisor and its affiliates, including through the waiver of management and incentive fees by the Advisor, that are subject to conditional reimbursement by us within three years. Any such distributions funded through expense reimbursements or waivers of management and incentive fees are not based on our investment performance, and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Advisor or its affiliates continues to advance such expenses or waive such fees. Our future reimbursement of amounts advanced or waived by the Advisor and its affiliates will reduce the distributions that you would otherwise receive in the future. Other than as set forth in this Report, the Advisor and its affiliates have no obligation to advance expenses or waive advisory fees. We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all dividends declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Shares will be issued pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan at their NAV per Share for such Shares at the time the distribution is payable. There is no sales load or other charge for reinvestment, but shareholder servicing fees and distribution fees will be charged where applicable. The Company may terminate the distribution reinvestment plan at any time upon 30 days notice to shareholders. Any expenses of the distribution reinvestment plan will be borne by the Company. The reinvestment of dividends and distributions pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan will increase the Company s assets on which the Base Management Fee is payable to the Advisor. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shareholders receiving Shares under the distribution reinvestment plan will be treated as having received a distribution equal to the amount payable to them in cash as a distribution had the shareholder not participated in the distribution reinvestment plan. Discretionary Share Repurchase Program We do not intend to list our Shares on a securities exchange and we do not expect there to be a public market for our shares. As a result, if you purchase our Shares, your ability to sell your shares will be limited. We have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase in each quarter, subject to market conditions and the discretion of the Board, up to 5 of our Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All Shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Shares.

Table of Contents 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 84,438 and 148,778 Shares, respectively, pursuant to our discretionary share repurchase program. See Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II of this Report for more information. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management will utilize available information, which includes our history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We will evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified the valuation of portfolio investments, specifically the valuation of Level 3 investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. We have also identified revenue recognition as a critical accounting policy. See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in Item 1. Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for more information regarding the Company s most significant accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of its investment portfolio and revenue recognition. These significant accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1. Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I of this Report, Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with the Board-approved valuation policies, represented approximately 175.5 and 169.6 , respectively, of our total net assets. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into certain contracts under which we may have material future commitments. We have entered into each of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement with the Advisor to provide us with investment advisory services and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the Advisory Agreement and payment of the Administration Fee under the Administration Agreement are described in Note 3. Related Party Transactions in Item 1. Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements . Under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Advisor has engaged SGEAIL to provide certain ongoing, non-discretionary investment advice and services to the Advisor in regard to the Advisor s management of the Company, in exchange for which the Sub-Advisor will receive from the Advisor 20 of the Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee payable to the Advisor by the Company. In addition, we have entered into the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement with the Advisor which was most recently extended in March 2024 for an additional one-year term, ending on April 3, 2025, and which may be extended for additional one-year periods on an annual basis. Under the Amended Expense Limitation Agreement, any Expense Payments will be subject to recoupment by the Advisor to the extent that such recoupment would not cause the Company to exceed the Expense Cap. See Note 3. Related Party Transactions in Item 1. Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for more information. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 1,649,015 and 2,372,090, respectively, in expenses subject to recoupment by the Advisor. Recoupment must occur within three years from the end of the month in which such fees and expenses were waived, reimbursed or paid by the Advisor. If any of our contractual obligations are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we receive under the Advisory Agreement, the Sub-Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our balance sheet. Our investment portfolio may contain debt investments that are in the form of revolving lines of credit and unfunded delayed draw commitments and limited partnership interests, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan agreements and subscription agreements, respectively. Unfunded commitments on debt investments are presented on our consolidated schedule of investments at fair value. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation, if any, is included in our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities and consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the following outstanding commitments to fund investments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we believe we have adequate financial resources to satisfy such commitments.

Recent Developments The Company s management has evaluated events subsequent to September 30, 2024 through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. The Company has concluded that there are no events requiring adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements other than as set forth below. As of October 1, 2024, the Company sold 3,685,269 Shares in the Private Offering pursuant to Subscription Agreements entered into with the participating investors for aggregate consideration of 95.7 million. On November 1, 2024, the Company offered to purchase up to 1,315,366 Shares at a purchase price equal to the NAV per Share as of December 30, 2024 (the November 2024 Tender Offer ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to purchase for the November 2024 Tender Offer. The November 2024 Tender Offer is set to expire on December 2, 2024. On November 11, 2024, the Board declared a distribution on the Shares equal to an aggregate amount up to the (i) Company s taxable earnings, including net investment income (if positive) and capital gains, for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and (ii) such other amounts as may be required to allow the Company to qualify for taxation as a RIC under the Code and eliminate any income and excise tax imposed on the Company (the Q4 2024 Distribution ). The Q4 2024 Distribution is payable on January 30, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2024. The final amount of the Q4 2024 Distribution will be determined by the Company s management at a later date, in accordance with the Board s authorization. The Q4 2024 Distribution will be paid in cash or reinvested in additional Shares for shareholders participating in the Company s DRIP. The Company received approximately 71.9 million of subscriptions effective November 1, 2024 in connection with its monthly closing for the Private Offering. On October 31, 2024, the Company amended the Wells Fargo SPV III Credit Facility (the Wells Fargo First Amendment ). The Wells Fargo First Amendment, among other things, (1) increased the aggregate commitments by the lenders under the Wells Fargo SPV III Credit Facility to 400,000,000, and (2) decreased the applicable margin on borrowings to 2.25 under the Wells Fargo SPV III Credit Facility.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. To the extent that we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to the variable rate investments we may hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. A rise in interest rates would also be expected to lead to higher cost on our floating rate borrowings, including under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, the BMO SPV II Credit Facility and the Wells Fargo SPV III Credit Facility, which may reduce our net investment income. We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We invest primarily in illiquid debt securities of private middle-market companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures adopted by the Advisor and overseen by the Board in accordance with the Advisor s valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. Because most of our investments bear interest at floating rates, we anticipate that an increase in interest rates would have a corresponding increase in our interest income that would likely offset any increase in our cost of funds and, thus, net investment income would not be reduced. A prolonged reduction in interest rates could reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in interest rates are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over the applicable interest rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have an adverse effect on our net investment income. Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that the Company took no actions to alter its existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates.

 This analysis is indicative of the potential impact on our net investment income as of September 30, 2024, assuming an immediate and sustained change in interest rates as noted. It should be noted that we anticipate growth in our portfolio funded in part with additional borrowings under the MassMutual SPV I Facility, the BMO SPV II Credit Facility and the Wells Fargo SPV III Credit Facility, and potentially other borrowings, and such borrowings, to the extent they are floating rate borrowings, all else being equal, will increase our sensitivity to interest rates, and such changes could be material. In addition, this analysis does not adjust for potential changes in our portfolio or our borrowing facilities after September 30, 2024, nor does it take into account any changes in the credit performance of our loans that might occur should interest rates change. Because it is our intention to hold loans to maturity, the fluctuating relative value of these loans that may occur due to changes in interest rates may have an impact on unrealized gains and losses during quarterly reporting periods. Based on our assessment of the interest rate risk, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no hedging transactions in place as we deemed the risk acceptable, and we did not believe it was necessary to mitigate this risk at that time. From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each such investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future fair values and cash

flows, as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We may use derivative instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we may have the ability to borrow in foreign currencies under any credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rate differences. We expect to typically be a net receiver of these foreign currencies as related for our international investment positions, and, as a result, our investments denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent not hedged, are expected to benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has not identified any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

The outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and there can be no assurance whether any legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s or the Advisor s financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Before making a decision to transact in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks referenced below and all other information contained in this Report, including our interim financial statements and the related notes thereto, which could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results, as well as the value of the Company s securities.
