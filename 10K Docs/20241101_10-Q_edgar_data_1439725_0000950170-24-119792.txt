SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those set forth under the caption Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those discussed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on March 1, 2024. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, as well as statements regarding industry trends, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potentially, predict, should, will or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. 
 We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, factors, and assumptions described under the section titled Risk Factors in this Report and in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, regarding, among other things: 
 our inability to achieve or sustain profitability; 

our unaudited financial statements include a statement that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and a continuation of negative financial trends could result in our inability to continue as a going concern; 

our ability to attain significant market acceptance among payers, providers, clinics, patients, and biopharmaceutical companies for our diagnostic tests; 

difficulties managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations; 

failure to retain sales and marketing personnel, and failure to increase our sales and marketing capabilities or develop broad awareness of our diagnostic tests to generate revenue growth; 

failure to maintain our current relationships, or enter into new relationships, with biopharmaceutical companies; 

significant fluctuation in our operating results, causing our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we provide; 

product performance and reliability to maintain and grow our business; 

third-party suppliers, including courier services, contract manufacturers and single source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations; 

the impact of a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States (U.S.) or worldwide, including the COVID-19 pandemic on our business; 

natural or man-made disasters and other similar events negatively impacting our business, financial condition, and results of operations; 

failure to offer high-quality support for our diagnostic tests, which may adversely affect our relationships with providers and negatively impact our reputation among patients and providers; 

our inability to continue to innovate and improve our diagnostic tests and services we offer; 

security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access; 

significant disruptions in our information technology systems; 

the incurrence of substantial liabilities and limiting or halting the marketing and sale of our diagnostic tests due to product liability lawsuits; 

our inability to compete successfully with competition from many sources, including larger companies; 

performance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers; 

cost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups and integrated delivery networks having a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability; 

potential effects of litigation and other proceedings; 

ii 

general economic and financial market conditions; 

our ability to attract and retain key personnel; 

current and future debt financing placing restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility; 

our need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, develop our platform, commercialize new diagnostic tests, or expand our operations; 

the acquisition of other businesses, which could require significant management attention; 

the uncertainty of the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved diagnostic tests; 

future healthcare reform measures that could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our diagnostic tests; 

compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws; 

compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws; 

our ability to develop, receive regulatory clearance or approval or certification for, and introduce new diagnostic tests or enhancements to existing diagnostic tests that will be accepted by the market in a timely manner; 

failure to comply with ongoing FDA or other domestic and foreign regulatory authority requirements, or unanticipated problems with our diagnostic tests, causing them to be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market; 

future product recalls; 

legal proceedings initiated by third parties alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain; 

the volatility of the trading price of our common stock; 

inaccurate estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors; and 

other risks, uncertainties and factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors". 

These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include additional factors that could harm our business and financial performance. New risk factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference and have filed as exhibits with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

 Medicare-covered blood-based lung cancer tests across the lung cancer continuum of care to support treatment decisions across all stages of lung cancer: Diagnosis Nodify CDT and Nodify XL2 tests, marketed as Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment, assess a suspicious lung nodule's risk of lung cancer to help identify the most appropriate treatment pathway. The Nodify CDT and XL2 tests have an established average turnaround time of one and five business days, respectively, from receipt of the blood sample, providing physicians with timely results to guide diagnostic planning. The Nodify CDT test is a blood-based test that detects the presence of seven autoantibodies associated with the presence of tumors. Elevated levels of the autoantibodies in patients with lung nodules indicate an increased risk of lung cancer to help identify patients that may benefit from timely intervention. The Nodify XL2 test is a blood-based proteomic test that evaluates the likelihood that a lung nodule is benign to help identify patients that may benefit from surveillance imaging. We believe we are the only company to offer commercial blood-based tests to help physicians reclassify risk of malignancy in patients with suspicious lung nodules. 

 Treatment Monitoring GeneStrat ddPCR, GeneStrat NGS and VeriStrat tests, marketed as part of our IQLung testing strategy, are used following diagnosis of lung cancer to detect the presence of mutations in the tumor and the state of the patient s immune system to help guide treatment decisions. The GeneStrat ddPCR tumor genomic profiling test and the VeriStrat immune profiling test have established an average turnaround time of two business days from receipt of the blood sample, and the GeneStrat NGS test has an established average turnaround time of three business days from receipt of the blood sample, providing physicians with timely results to facilitate treatment decisions. The GeneStrat ddPCR test evaluates the presence of actionable mutations in lung cancer. The test is covered independent of stage and can be used multiple times per patient to monitor changes in mutation status. The GeneStrat NGS test is a broad 52 gene panel, including guideline recommended mutations that help identify advanced stage patients eligible for targeted therapy or clinical trial enrollment. The VeriStrat test is a blood-based proteomic test that provides a personalized view of each patient s immune response to their lung cancer. 

 In developing the Company's products, we have developed or designed a regulatory strategy resulting in approvals, product development and clinical acumen, biorepositories, proprietary and patented technologies, specimen collection kit manufacturing capabilities, and bioinformatics methods that it believes are important to the development of new targeted therapies, determining clinical trial eligibility, and guiding treatment selection. The Company s testing services are made available through its clinical laboratories.

 million and we have million in outstanding aggregate principal amount on our Perceptive Term Loan Facility (see Note 6 Debt ). We have incurred significant losses since inception and, as a result, we have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock, the sale of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of notes payable, and from our two primary revenue sources: (i) diagnostic testing, which includes lung diagnostic testing and (ii) providing biopharmaceutical companies with development and testing services and licensing our technologies. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 (ASC Topic 205-40), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , the Company is required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, management projected its cash flow sources and evaluated the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements were issued. Management considered the Company s current projections of future cash flows, our ability to execute our current operating plan, current financial condition, sources of liquidity and debt obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q in considering whether it has the ability to meet its obligations. Our ability to meet our obligations as they come due may be impacted by our ability to remain compliant with financial covenants in our Perceptive Term Loan Facility (see Note 6 Debt or to obtain waivers or amendments that impact the related covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive and financial covenants associated with its borrowings. Our ability to maintain our financial covenants under our Perceptive Term Loan Facility during the next twelve months is, in part, dependent upon executing our current operating plan. If we do not execute our current operating plan and maintain our financial covenants, this could result in an Event of Default (as defined in the Perceptive Term Loan Facility), causing an acceleration and repayment of the outstanding balances. The Perceptive Term Loan Facility requires the Company to meet certain minimum net revenue threshold amounts agreed to between the Company and Perceptive as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, which commenced with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023. During 2023, the Company entered into various amendments to the Perceptive Term Loan Facility to reduce the relevant Minimum Net Revenue thresholds. On February 29, 2024, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Perceptive Term Loan Facility, whereby, subject to the terms and conditions of the third amendment, the Minimum Net Revenue Covenant was amended to reduce the relevant threshold through the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2025 (see Note 6 Debt ). During the three months ended June 30, 2024 , the Company completed an underwritten offering of common stock and a concurrent private placement (the April 2024 Offering). Collectively, the Company raised net proceeds of approximately million (see Note 8 Equity ). We have taken steps to improve our liquidity through raising debt and equity capital and have also undertaken several proactive measures including, among other things, the reduction of planned capital expenditures and certain operating expenses as previously disclosed. If we do not execute our current operating plan, we may need to consider further measures to reduce our operating expenses. These measures would limit or reduce our operations and could include a hiring freeze, reductions in our workforce, reduction in cash compensation, deferring capital expenditures, and reducing other operating costs. If we do not execute our current operating plan we may need to continue to raise additional funds from external sources, such as through the issuance of debt or equity securities. We may also raise additional capital to restructure our existing debt or for general working capital purposes, or both. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we do raise additional capital through equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders rights. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us or, if available, will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us or on a timely basis. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near term while we make investments to support our anticipated growth. Our ability to maintain our financial covenants is, in part, dependent upon executing our current operating plan and, along with the items noted above, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Our unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

The financial liabilities that are measured and recorded at estimated fair value on a recurring basis consist of our contingent consideration associated with our previous acquisition of Indi, the warrant liabilities granted as consideration for the Perceptive Term Loan Facility (see Note 6 - Debt ), and contingent value rights granted to certain holders of our previously converted Series F Preferred Stock, which were accounted for as liabilities and remeasured through our condensed statements of operations.

Contingent Consideration In connection with the acquisition of Indi in 2018, the Company recorded contingent consideration for amounts contingently payable to Indi's selling shareholders pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement (the Indi APA). The contingent consideration arrangement gross margin target of million within the period after the acquisition date, which was achieved during the three months ended June 30, 2021. Under the terms of the original agreement, when the gross margin target was achieved, the Company was required to issue shares of common stock. For the six months following the achievement of the gross margin target, Indi had the option to require the Company to redeem these common shares for million in cash over equal quarterly installments. million. In August 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the original agreement in which all parties agreed to forgo the issuance of common stock and agreed that the Company would, in lieu thereof, make six quarterly installments of approximately million each beginning in January 2022 and a final payment of approximately million in July 2023 for a total of million (the Milestone Payments and each individually a Milestone Payment). The aggregate amount of payments owed by the Company under this amendment is the same as if Indi had exercised the put right or the Company had exercised the call right provided for in the original agreement. On April 7, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Indi APA, in which the parties agreed to restructure the Milestone Payments. The Company made quarterly installments of million each beginning in April 2022, quarterly installments of million which began in July 2023, installment of million in April 2024, and one installment of million in July 2024. In addition, the Company agreed to an exit fee of approximately million to be paid in October 2024.

Our ability to make these payments was subject to ongoing compliance under the Perceptive Term Loan Facility. On September 30, 2024, the Company obtained consent from Perceptive and prepaid the October 1, 2024 exit fee of million to Indi. The contingent consideration liability was accounted for at fair value and subject to certain unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the measurement of the fair value included the probability of successful achievement of the specified product gross margin targets, the period in which the targets were expected to be achieved, and discount rates which ranged from to . As a result of the achievement of the gross margin target, the only remaining significant unobservable input used in the measurement of fair value included the discount rate since all other inputs became fixed and determinable. Subsequent changes to the contingent consideration following the achievement of the gross margin target were recorded as Interest expense in the condensed statements of operations resulting from the passage of time and fixed payment schedule. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million and million, respectively, compared to million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, in interest expense due to the passage of time and fixed payment schedule. In accordance with ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows , cash paid to settle the contingent consideration liability recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date (including measurement-period adjustments) should be reflected as a cash outflow for financing activities while the remaining portion of the amount paid should be reflected as a cash outflow from operating activities in the statements of cash flows. All 2024 Milestone Payments are classified as cash outflows from operating activities in the Company's statements of cash flows.

Contingent Value Rights In January 2016, the Company issued shares of Series F Preferred Stock (the Series F Offering) that were subsequently converted into common stock in connection with the Company's initial public offering in October 2020. In connection with the Series F Offering, investors who purchased more than their pro-rata amount in the financing received a calculated number of contingent value rights (CVRs).

In January 2016, the Company issued CVRs, or interest in the drug ficlatuzumab, originally valued at million. The initial estimated value of the CVRs were recorded as a liability and as a reduction to the Series F proceeds. Subsequent to recoupment of our initial co-development costs, upon receipt of a milestone, royalty, or any other type of payment from the Company s ownership rights in the drug, the Company is required to make a cash payment to the CVR holders equal to of net proceeds, as defined. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded as a change in fair value through the condensed statements of operations due to the probability of receiving net proceeds in excess of our initial co-development costs.

 Overview 
 We are a leading diagnostic solutions company with a focus on lung disease. By combining a multi-omic approach with a holistic view of the patient s disease state, we believe our solutions provide physicians with greater insights to help personalize their patient s care and meaningfully improve disease detection, evaluation, and treatment. Our unique approach to precision medicine provides timely and actionable clinical information, which we believe helps improve overall patient outcomes and lowers the overall healthcare cost by reducing the use of ineffective and unnecessary treatments and procedures. In addition to our diagnostic tests, we provide biopharmaceutical companies with services that include diagnostic research, clinical trial testing, and the discovery, development, and commercialization of companion diagnostics. We also recognize revenue from other services, including amounts derived from licensing our technologies. 
 Our core belief is that no single technology will answer all clinical questions that we encounter. Therefore, we employ multiple technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics, and artificial intelligence enabled informatics to discover innovative diagnostic tests for potential clinical use. Our multi-omic approach is designed to enable us to discover diagnostic tests that answer critical clinical questions faced by physicians, researchers, and biopharmaceutical companies. 
 We regularly engage with our customers, key opinion leaders, and scientific experts to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving diagnostic treatment landscape to identify additional clinical unmet needs where a diagnostic test could help improve patient care. Additionally, we incorporate clinical and molecular profiling data from our commercial clinical testing, research studies, clinical trials, and biopharmaceutical customers or other collaborative partnerships, to continue to advance our platform. We have a variety of samples with associated data in our biobank, including tumor profiles and immune profiles, which are used for both internal and external research and development initiatives. 
 We have commercialized five diagnostic tests for our lung diagnostic business, each of which have Medicare coverage, which are currently available for use by physicians. Our Nodify CDT and Nodify XL2 tests, marketed as Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment, assess the risk of lung cancer to help identify the most appropriate treatment pathway. The Nodify CDT and XL2 tests have an established average turnaround time of one and five business days, respectively, from receipt of the blood sample, providing physicians with timely results to guide diagnostic planning. The Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment has resulted in a change in the calculated risk of malignancy in 80-85 of the cases. We believe we are the only company to offer two commercial blood-based tests to help physicians reclassify risk of malignancy in patients with suspicious lung nodules. Our GeneStrat ddPCR, GeneStrat NGS, and VeriStrat tests, marketed as the IQLung testing strategy, are used following diagnosis of lung cancer to measure the presence of mutations in the tumor and the state of the patient s immune system to establish the patient s prognosis and help guide treatment decisions. The GeneStrat targeted tumor profiling test and the VeriStrat immune profiling test have an established average turnaround time of two business days. The GeneStrat NGS test is our blood-based NGS test and has an established average turnaround time of three business days. The 52-gene panel includes guideline recommended mutations to help physicians treating advanced-stage lung cancer patients identify all four major mutation classes and genes, such as EGFR, ALK, KRAS, MET, NTRK, ERBB2, and others, and delivers them in an expedited timeframe so patient treatment can begin sooner. 
 24 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 In addition to the five diagnostic tests currently on the market, we offer a broad range of assays for research use as part of our laboratory services which have been used by over 65 biopharmaceutical companies and academic partners. All of our diagnostic and services testing is performed at one of our two accredited, high-complexity clinical laboratories in Louisville, Colorado and De Soto, Kansas. 
 Since our inception, we have performed over 600,000 clinical diagnostic tests and continue to generate a large and growing body of clinical evidence consisting of over 300 clinical and scientific peer-reviewed publications, presentations, and abstracts. Through ongoing study of each of our tests, we continue to grow our depth of understanding of disease biology and the broad utility of each of our tests. We believe we are poised for rapid growth by leveraging our scientific and clinical development and laboratory operations expertise along with our commercial infrastructure which includes sales, marketing, reimbursement, and regulatory affairs. 
 In the United States, we market our tests to clinical customers through our direct sales organization, which includes sales representatives that are engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily to pulmonologists, oncologists, cancer centers and nodule clinics. We market our tests and services to biopharmaceutical companies globally through our targeted business development team, which promotes the broad utility of our tests and testing capabilities throughout drug development and commercialization which is of value to pharmaceutical companies and their drug-development process. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 We believe there are several important factors that have impacted our operating performance and results of operations, including: 
 Testing volume and customer mix. Our revenues and costs are affected by the volume of testing and mix of customers from period to period. We evaluate both the volume of our commercial tests, or the number of tests that we perform for patients on behalf of clinicians, as well as tests for biopharmaceutical companies. Our performance depends on our ability to retain and broaden adoption with existing customers, as well as attract new customers. We believe that the test volume we receive from clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are indicators of growth in each of these customer verticals. Customer mix for our tests has the potential to significantly impact our results of operations, as the average selling price for biopharmaceutical sample testing is currently significantly greater than our average selling price for clinical tests since we are not a contracted provider for, or our tests are not covered by all clinical patients insurance. We evaluate our average selling price for tests that are covered by Medicare, Medicare Advantage and commercial payers to understand the trends in reimbursement and apply those trends to our revenue recognition policies. 

Reimbursement for clinical diagnostic testing. Our revenue depends on achieving broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests from third-party payers, including both commercial and government payers. All five Biodesix blood-based lung diagnostic tests within Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment testing and IQLung strategy for lung cancer patients are covered by Medicare. Payment from third-party payers differs depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payers as a participating provider or do not have a contract and are considered a non-participating provider. Payers will often reimburse non-participating providers, if at all, at a lower rate than participating providers. 

Historically, we have experienced situations where commercial payers proactively reduced the amounts they were willing to reimburse for our tests, and in other situations, commercial payers have determined that the amounts they previously paid were too high and have sought to recover those perceived excess payments by deducting such amounts from payments otherwise being made. When we contract to serve as a participating provider, reimbursements are made pursuant to a negotiated fee schedule and are limited to only covered indications. Becoming a participating provider generally results in higher reimbursement for covered indications and lack of reimbursement for non-covered indications. As a result, the impact of becoming a participating provider with a specific payer will vary. If we are not able to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, we may not be able to effectively increase our testing volume and revenue as expected. Additionally, retrospective reimbursement adjustments can negatively impact our revenue and cause our financial results to fluctuate. 
 On July 6, 2023, the Company announced that the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) has designated the Nodify CDT Test as an Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test (ADLT) effective June 30, 2023. Obtaining ADLT status is a recognition that the Nodify CDT test meets the stringent criteria established under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. ADLT status is reserved for innovative tests with Medicare coverage that provide new clinical diagnostic information that cannot be obtained from any other test or combination of tests. Nodify CDT joins our Nodify XL2 and VeriStrat tests with the ADLT designation. 
 Investment in clinical studies and product innovation to support growth. A significant aspect of our business is our investment in research and development, including the development of new products and our investments in clinical studies for our on-market and pipeline products. Our studies focus on generating evidence to support expanded payer coverage, commercial adoption, and regulatory approvals. Current efforts are focused primarily on clinical utility as well as 

25 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 understanding the economic impact of our tests in assisting with decisions related to patient management and the potential impact of our tests in reducing overall healthcare costs. 

The ongoing INSIGHT study was designed to expand our clinical understanding of the predictive and prognostic value of the VeriStrat test. On June 27, 2023, we completed enrollment of 5,000 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. All study participants currently enrolled in the study are expected to complete study follow-up by 2026. The participant data will be monitored, and sites will be closed accordingly throughout 2025. 
 On July 12, 2023, we announced the prospective, real-world ORACLE study (An Observational Registry Study to Evaluate the Performance of the Nodify XL2 Test) achieved the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change in the proportion of benign lung nodules managed by Nodify XL2 experiencing invasive procedures. The ORACLE study showed patients with benign nodules managed with the Nodify XL2 test were 74 less likely to undergo an unnecessary invasive procedure compared to the control group. Additionally, the proportion of patients sent to CT surveillance with malignant nodules did not differ between the Nodify XL2 group and the control group. The ORACLE study officially closed on May 28, 2024. 
 The ALTITUDE study is a randomized control study, launched during the fourth quarter 2020, seeking to further demonstrate the utility of the Nodify CDT and XL2 tests. 
 On October 8, 2024, at the CHEST Annual Meeting, the Company presented the experience of healthcare providers using the Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment in over 35,000 patients consecutively tested in a real-world clinical setting. The Company also announced a new clinical study, CLARIFY, that will collect patient outcomes and other clinical information on a subset of the patients featured in the CHEST presentation. CLARIFY is designed to confirm performance of the Nodify CDT and Nodify XL2 tests in diverse patient subgroups through a retrospective chart review of up to 4,000 patients that were tested in a real-world clinical setting. The study's intent is to expand the extensive evidence characterizing the validation and utility of Nodify Lung testing. 
 Our clinical research has resulted in approximately 90 peer-reviewed publications for our tests. In addition to clinical studies, we are collaborating with investigators from multiple academic cancer centers. On June 3, 2022, we announced the intent to develop a new novel molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) test as a part of a master sponsored research agreement (MSRA) with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). In addition, the MSRA between MSK and the Company also includes the potential future development of other diagnostic tests aimed at improving the treatment of cancer. On March 25, 2024, we announced a new master collaborative research agreement (MCRA) with MSK under which the teams will collaborate on a development plan for diagnostic tests aimed at improving the treatment of cancer. Biodesix will utilize its array of genomics, proteomics, and data mining capabilities with the aim of developing and commercializing oncology biomarker assays in collaboration with MSK. Bio-Rad will provide its industry-leading digital PCR assay technology in support of this important work. We believe these studies and collaborative arrangements are critical to gaining physician adoption and driving favorable coverage decisions by payers and expect our investments in research and development to increase. Further we also expect to increase our research and development expenses to fund further innovation and develop new clinically relevant tests. 
 Ability to attract new biopharmaceutical customers and maintain and expand relationships with existing customers . Our business development team promotes the broad utility of our products for biopharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. Our revenue, business opportunities and growth depend in part on our ability to attract new biopharmaceutical customers and to maintain and expand relationships with existing biopharmaceutical customers. We expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses in furtherance of this as we continue to develop these relationships, and we expect to support a growing number of investigations and clinical trials. If our relationships expand, we believe we may have opportunities to offer our platform for companion diagnostic development, novel target discovery and validation efforts, and to grow into other commercial opportunities. For example, we believe our multi-omic data including genomic and proteomic data, in combination with clinical outcomes or claims data, has revenue-generating potential, including for novel target identification and companion diagnostic discovery and development. 

Motivating and expanding our field sales force and customer support team . Our field sales force is the primary point of contact in the clinical setting. These representatives of the Company must cover expansive geographic regions which limits their time for interaction and education of our products in the clinical setting. We plan to continue investing in the field sales force through select expansion and provide them with tools that maximize their education and selling efforts in order to achieve greater returns. Additionally, we plan to invest in the marketing and customer support teams to continue to provide the field sales force with the resources to be successful.

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 While each of these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Form 10-Q and Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information. 
 Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights 
 The following were significant developments affecting our business, capital structure and liquidity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 unless otherwise noted: 
 Total revenue of 18.2 million, an increase of 35 over the third quarter 2023: 

o Lung Diagnostic revenue of 17.2 million reflected a year-over-year increase of 40 driven by the continued adoption of Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT nodule risk assessment tests and strong reimbursement. However, test volumes were impacted at the end of the third quarter by disruption to patients, healthcare providers, and Biodesix teammates in the southeast due to Hurricane Helene; 

o Biopharmaceutical Services revenue of 1.0 million decreased 17 year-over-year, driven by the timing of receipt of samples and shift of the completion of certain projects from the end of the third quarter into the beginning of the fourth; 

Third quarter 2024 gross profit of 14.0 million, or 77.0 gross margin compared to 76.1 gross margin in the comparable prior year period. Our steady margin performance is primarily driven by volume growth in Lung Diagnostic testing that continues to drive down the per test costs; 

Operating expenses (excluding direct costs and expenses) of 22.6 million, an increase of 29 as compared to the third quarter 2023, which includes 3.0 million of non-cash stock compensation expense and depreciation and amortization as compared to 1.7 million in third quarter of 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing costs to support both business lines sales growth to enhance product awareness and drive adoption, and an increase in depreciation expense related to the leasehold improvements in the Company s Louisville, CO offices and laboratory which opened in January 2024; 

Net loss of 10.3 million, an improvement of 6 as compared to the same period of 2023; 

Cash and cash equivalents of 31.4 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease from 42.2 million from June 30, 2024; 

o Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 includes the final milestone payment of 6.1 million for the acquisition of Integrated Diagnostics in 2018. 

Components of Operating Results 
 Revenues 
 We derive our revenue from two primary sources: (i) providing diagnostic testing in the clinical setting (Diagnostic Tests); and (ii) providing biopharmaceutical companies with services that include diagnostic research, clinical research, clinical trial testing, development and testing services generally provided outside the clinical setting and governed by individual contracts with third parties as well as development and commercialization of companion diagnostics. We also recognize revenue from other services, including amounts derived from licensing our technologies (Biopharmaceutical Services and other). 
 Diagnostic Tests 
 Diagnostic test revenue is generated from delivery of results from our diagnostic tests. In the United States, we performed tests as both an in-network and out-of-network service provider depending on the test performed and the contracted status of the insurer. We consider diagnostic testing to be completed upon the delivery of test results to our customer, either the prescribing physician or third-party to which we contracted for services to be performed, which is considered the performance obligation. The fees for such services are billed either to a third party such as Medicare, medical facilities, commercial insurance payers, or to the patient. We determine the transaction price related to our contracts by considering the nature of the payer, test type, the historical amount of time until payment by a payer and historical price concessions granted to groups of customers. 
 Biopharmaceutical Services and other 
 Biopharmaceutical Services revenue is generated from the delivery of our on-market tests, pipeline tests, custom diagnostic testing, and other scientific services for a purpose as defined by any individual customer. At times we collaborate with large biopharmaceutical companies in an attempt to discover biomarkers that would be helpful in their drug development or marketing. The performance 
 27 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 obligations and related revenue for these sales is defined by a written agreement between us and our customer. These services are generally completed upon the delivery of testing results, or other contractually defined milestone(s), to the customer, which is considered the performance obligation. Customers for these services are typically large pharmaceutical companies where collectability is reasonably assured and therefore revenue is accrued upon completion of the performance obligations. Revenue derived from services is often unpredictable and can cause significant swings in our overall net revenue line from quarter to quarter. 
 In addition, other revenue includes amounts derived from licensing our digital sequencing technologies to our international laboratory partners. We are compensated through royalty-based payments for the licensed technology, and depending on the nature of the technology licensing arrangements, and considering factors including, but not limited to: enforceable right to payment and payment terms, and if an asset with alternative use is created, these revenues are recognized in the period when royalty-bearing sales occur. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Direct costs and expenses 
 Cost of diagnostic testing generally consists of cost of materials, direct labor, including bonuses, employee benefits, share-based compensation, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with acquiring and processing test samples, including sample accessioning, test performance, quality control analyses, charges to collect and transport samples; curation of test results for physicians; and in some cases, license or royalty fees due to third parties. Costs associated with performing our tests are recorded as the tests are processed regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to the tests. Infrastructure expenses include allocated depreciation of laboratory equipment, rent costs, amortization of leasehold improvements and information technology costs. Royalties for licensed technology are calculated as a percentage of revenues generated using the associated technology and recorded as expense at the time the related revenue is recognized. One-time royalty payments related to signing of license agreements or other milestones, such as issuance of new patents, are amortized to expense over the expected useful life of the patents. While we do not believe the technologies underlying these licenses are necessary to permit us to provide our tests, we do believe these technologies are potentially valuable and of possible strategic importance to us or our competitors. Under these license agreements, we are obligated to pay aggregate royalties ranging from 1 to 8 of sales in which the patents or know-how are used in the product or service sold, sometimes subject to minimum annual royalties or fees in certain agreements. 
 We expect the aggregate cost of diagnostic testing to increase in line with the increase in the number of tests we perform, but the cost per test to decrease modestly over time due to the efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases, and from automation and other cost reductions. Cost of services includes costs incurred for the performance of development services requested by our customers. Costs of development services will vary depending on the nature, timing and scope of customer projects. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to develop technology and include salaries, share-based compensation and benefits, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work, clinical trials infrastructure expenses, including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs, contract services, quality and regulatory support, other outside costs and costs to develop our technology capabilities. Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. 
 External expenses include: (i) payments to third parties in connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, including contract research organizations and consultants; (ii) the cost of manufacturing products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including payments to contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and consultants; (iii) scientific development services, consulting research fees and for sponsored research arrangements with third parties; (iv) laboratory supplies; and (v) allocated facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for IT, rent and maintenance of facilities. External expenses are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. We track external costs by the stage of program, clinical or preclinical. 
 Internal expenses include employee-related costs, including salaries, share-based compensation and related benefits for employees engaged in research and development functions. We do not track internal costs by product candidate because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are deferred and recognized as expense in the period in which the related goods are received or services are rendered. Costs to develop our technology capabilities are recorded as research and development. 
 28 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to innovate and develop additional products and expand our data management resources. As our services revenue grows, an increasing portion of research and development dollars are expected to be allocated to cost of services for biopharmaceutical service contracts. This expense, though expected to increase in dollars, is expected to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, though it may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenues from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 Sales, marketing, general and administrative 
 Our sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with our sales organization, including our direct sales force and sales management, client services, marketing, public relations, communications and reimbursement, as well as business development personnel who are focused on our biopharmaceutical customers. These expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, share-based compensation, and travel, as well as marketing and educational activities and allocated overhead expenses. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollars as we expand our sales force, increase our presence within the United States, and increase our marketing activities to drive further awareness and adoption of our tests and our future products and services. These expenses, though expected to increase in dollars, are expected to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, though they may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenues from period to period due to the timing and nature of these expenses. 
 Our general and administrative expenses include costs for our executive, accounting, finance, legal and human resources functions. These expenses consist principally of salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, share-based compensation, and travel, as well as professional services fees such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, and general corporate costs and allocated overhead expenses. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in dollars, primarily due to increased headcount and costs associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to legal, accounting, regulatory, maintaining compliance with exchange listing and requirements of the SEC, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations. These expenses, though expected to increase in dollars, are expected to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, though they may fluctuate as a percentage from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 Non-Operating Expenses 
 Interest expense and interest income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense consists of cash and non-cash interest from the Perceptive Term Loan Facility and changes in the value of our contingent consideration associated with the passage of time subsequent to the achievement of the gross margin target in the second quarter 2021. Interest income, which is included in Other income, net in the condensed statements of operations consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.

Total revenue increased 4.7 million or 35 , and increased 16.5 million or 48 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Diagnostic test revenue increased 4.9 million or 40 , and increased 15.1 million or 47 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases are primarily due to an increase of 4.7 million and 15.8 million, respectively, in the Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment testing strategy driven by an increase in tests delivered as our sales efforts continue to focus on Nodify CDT and XL2 tests. The increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a 0.7 million decrease in the IQLung testing strategy. The Company s diagnostic testing sales efforts continued to gain momentum during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the number of tests delivered reached the highest in Company history for seven consecutive quarters. 
 Biopharmaceutical Services and other revenue decreased 0.2 million or 17 , and increased 1.4 million or 68 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the timing of sample receipts from certain biopharmaceutical partners, while the increase

 in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of delivering against our expanding book of business and securing new agreements. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Direct costs and expenses 
 Direct costs and expenses related to revenue increased 1.0 million or 29 , and increased 1.6 million or 17 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by the increase in testing volume compared to the same periods in 2023, partially offset by the optimization of testing workflows that resulted in improvements in costs per test. 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses increased 0.6 million or 31 , and decreased 1.0 million or 12 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to an increase in internal expenses associated with compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in headcount, while the decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of a decrease in external costs associated with clinical trials and data acquisition costs. 
 The following table summarizes our external and internal costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except percentages):

Sales, marketing, general and administrative 
 Sales, marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 4.5 million or 29 , and increased 9.1 million or 18 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by increases in employee compensation and benefits associated with an increase in headcount and variable compensation as well as increases in non-employee costs associated with increased spending on various sales meetings and sales fulfillment during 2024 as compared to 2023. Of the 4.5 million and 9.1 million increase, 0.7 million and 2.1 million, respectively, is associated with the increase in depreciation expense related to the leasehold improvements in our new Louisville headquarters and laboratory. 
 Non-operating Expenses 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense decreased 0.3 million or 14 , and decreased 0.7 million or 10 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the interest associated with the declining contingent consideration balance as the remaining Milestone Payments and final exit fee payment were made. 
 Loss on extinguishment of liabilities 
 Loss on extinguishment of liabilities increased 0.2 million or 100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. On April 22, 2024, the Company obtained consent from Perceptive and prepaid the July 1, 2024 contingent consideration Milestone Payment of 8.4 million to Indi. As a result of prepaying the Milestone Payment, the Company performed a fair value analysis through April 22, 2024 and recorded a loss on early extinguishment of 0.2 million.

 Change in fair value of warrant liability, net 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded no change in fair value of warrant liability in the condensed statements of operations. The Tranche C loan had a commitment date through September 30, 2024 and, as of that date, the Company did not exercise its ability to draw the Tranche C loan. Therefore, the associated Tranche C Warrants expired and are no longer exercisable. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a 1.4 million and 1.3 million net loss, respectively, as a change in fair value through the condensed statements of operations due to changes in unobservable inputs. This was a result of changes in the probability of our ability to draw on Tranche B and C loans. 
 Other (expense) income, net 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded other income, net of 0.4 million and other expense, net of 0.1 million, respectively. The other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of interest income. The other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of deferred offering costs of approximately 0.7 million as a result of changes in the probability of our ability to fully utilize the LPC Facility prior to the termination date, offset by 0.6 million of interest and other income. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We are an emerging growth company and, as such, have yet to generate positive cash flows from operations. We have funded our operations to date principally from net proceeds from the sale of our common stock, the sale of convertible preferred stock, revenue from diagnostic testing and services, and the incurrence of indebtedness. 
 The Company amended the Indi APA agreement in April 2022 in which all parties agreed to restructure the Milestone Payments whereby the Company will make five quarterly installments of 2.0 million each beginning in April 2022, three quarterly installments of 3.0 million beginning in July 2023, one installment of 5.0 million in April 2024, and one installment of approximately 8.4 million in July 2024. In addition, the Company agreed to an exit fee of approximately 6.1 million in October 2024. Interest shall accrue on the difference between the payment schedule as agreed in the August 2021 amendment and the April 2022 amended payment schedule, at an aggregate per annum rate equal to 10 , with such interest to be payable quarterly on the following installment payment date. Our ability to make these payments is subject to ongoing compliance under the Perceptive Term Loan and commencing January 1, 2024, consent from Perceptive. On April 22, 2024, the Company obtained consent from Perceptive and prepaid the July 1, 2024 Milestone Payment of 8.4 million to Indi. On September 30, 2024, the Company obtained consent from Perceptive and prepaid the October 1, 2024 exit fee of 6.1 million to Indi. The Company has no remaining obligations to Indi. 
 On November 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the Credit Agreement) with Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP (Perceptive) as lender and administrative agent (the Lender) for up to 50.0 million, with funding of 30.0 million and the issuance of warrants exercisable into 3,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock occurring on November 21, 2022, and two additional contingently issuable tranches of 10.0 million each subject to certain terms and conditions, including revenue milestones. The Tranche C loan had a commitment date through September 30, 2024 and, as of that date, the Company did not exercise its ability to draw the Tranche C loan. 
 On April 7, 2023, the Company entered into a limited waiver under which the Lender agreed to waive the minimum revenue requirement for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (Limited Waiver). In addition, on May 10, 2023, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (First Amendment) with Perceptive as lender and administrative agent and the Company, as borrower, whereby subject to the terms and conditions of the First Amendment, the Minimum Net Revenue Covenant, as defined in the Credit Agreement, was modified to reduce the threshold through the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024. 
 On August 3, 2023, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements) with all of the members of our Board of Directors, all Section 16 officers, and additional members of the Biodesix leadership team for the issuance and sale by the Company of an aggregate of 16,975,298 of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 27.5 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received 15.3 million in proceeds and issued 9,454,927 shares of common stock. On September 27, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to delay final closing on one subscription agreement. The remaining 12.2 million in proceeds was received and 7,520,371 shares of common stock was issued during the three months ended December 31, 2023. 
 On August 4, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment) with Perceptive as lender and administrative agent and the Company, as borrower, whereby subject to the terms and conditions of the Second Amendment, the Minimum Net Revenue Covenant (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was amended to reduce the relevant threshold as of the last day of each fiscal quarter commencing on the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024 through and including the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025. 
 32 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 Pursuant to the original terms of the Credit Agreement entered into on November 21, 2022, the Perceptive Term Loan Facility includes an additional Tranche B Loan, in an aggregate amount of up to 10.0 million, which is accessible by the Company so long as the Company satisfies certain customary conditions precedent, including revenue milestones. Under the terms of the Second Amendment, the conditions precedent for drawing on the Tranche B Loan were amended to (i) reduce the trailing twelve-month revenue milestone and (ii) add the receipt of aggregate cash proceeds of at least 27.5 million from an equity offering of the Company's common stock. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company met the remaining conditions precedent associated with the Tranche B Loan and, on December 15, 2023, the Company exercised its ability to draw the Tranche B loan for 10.0 million (the Tranche B Loan). 
 On February 29, 2024 (the Third Amendment Effective Date), the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Third Amendment) with Perceptive as lender and administrative agent and the Company, as borrower, whereby subject to the terms and conditions of the Third Amendment, the Minimum Net Revenue Covenant (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was amended to reduce the relevant threshold as of the last day of each fiscal quarter commencing on the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024 through and including the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025. 
 On April 9, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten offering of common stock and a concurrent private placement. Collectively, the Company raised net proceeds of approximately 51.3 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had remaining available capacity for share issuances of up to 46.9 million under the LPC Facility, subject to the restrictions and limitations of the underlying facilities. On April 5, 2024, the Company filed Supplement No. 1 to the ATM Prospectus Supplement dated December 22, 2021. To comply with volume limitations under applicable SEC rules and regulations, Supplement No. 1 reduced the aggregate offering price to up to 100,000 of shares in order to maximize the amount the Company could offer under the April 2024 Offering. Following the successful completion of the Company s April 2024 Offering, the Company is no longer subject to volume limitations under applicable SEC rules and regulations that limit their availability as sources of funding. On August 7, 2024, the Company filed Supplement No. 2 to the ATM Prospectus Supplement dated December 22, 2021 to increase the aggregate offering price under the ATM facility up to the original 50.0 million of shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had remaining available capacity for share issuances of up to 28.2 million under the ATM facility. On November 1, 2024, the Company expects to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and enter into a new sales agreement with a financial institution, pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million, subject to terms and conditions (the 2024 ATM Program). The shares of common stock offered pursuant to the 2024 ATM Program will be offered and sold by the Company pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-3 once declared effective by the SEC. Sales of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program, if any, will be made at market prices by methods deemed to be an at-the-market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the NASDAQ Global Market, or any other existing trading market for our common stock. In connection with establishing the 2024 ATM Program, the Company terminated its prior 50.0 million ATM program established in November 2021, and no additional stock can be issued thereunder. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we maintained cash and cash equivalents of 31.4 million and we have 40.0 million in outstanding aggregate principal amount on our Perceptive Term Loan Facility. We have incurred significant losses since inception and, as a result, we have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock, the sale of convertible preferred stock, the issuance of notes payable, and from our two primary revenue sources: (i) diagnostic testing, which includes lung diagnostic testing and (ii) providing biopharmaceutical companies with development and testing services and licensing our technologies. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 (ASC Topic 205-40), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , the Company is required to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern each reporting period, including interim periods. In evaluating the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, management projected its cash flow sources and evaluated the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements were issued. Management considered the Company s current projections of future cash flows, our ability to execute our current operating plan, current financial condition, sources of liquidity and debt obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q in considering whether it has the ability to meet its obligations. 
 Our ability to meet our obligations as they come due may be impacted by our ability to remain compliant with financial covenants in our Perceptive Term Loan Facility or to obtain waivers or amendments that impact the related covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive and financial covenants associated with its borrowings. In addition, on October 30, 2024, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment), whereby, subject to the terms and conditions of the Fourth Amendment, the Minimum Net Revenue Covenant (as defined in the Credit Agreement) was amended to reduce the relevant threshold as of the last day of each fiscal quarter commencing on the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2025 through and including the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2027. 
 33 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 Our ability to maintain our financial covenants under our Perceptive Term Loan Facility during the next twelve months is, in part, dependent upon executing our current operating plan. If we do not execute our current operating plan and maintain our financial covenants, this could result in an Event of Default (as defined in the Perceptive Term Loan Facility), causing an acceleration and repayment of the outstanding balances. The Perceptive Term Loan Facility requires the Company to meet certain Minimum Net Revenue threshold amounts agreed to between the Company and Perceptive as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, which commenced with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023. We have taken steps to improve our liquidity through raising debt and equity capital and have also undertaken several proactive measures including, among other things, the reduction of planned capital expenditures and certain operating expenses. If we do not execute our current operating plan, we may need to consider further measures to reduce our operating expenses. These measures would limit or reduce our operations and could include a hiring freeze, reductions in our workforce, reduction in cash compensation, deferring capital expenditures, and reducing other operating costs. 
 If we do not execute our current operating plan we may need to continue to raise additional funds from external sources, such as through the issuance of debt or equity securities. We may also raise additional capital to restructure our existing debt or for general working capital purposes, or both. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we do raise additional capital through equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders rights. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us or, if available, will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us or on a timely basis. 
 We expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near term while we make investments to support our anticipated growth. Our ability to maintain our financial covenants is, in part, dependent upon executing our current operating plan and, along with the items noted above, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Our unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

(23,247) 

Our cash flows resulted in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 5.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the net decrease in cash of 23.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities totaled 44.6 million, an increase of approximately 34.0 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to unfavorable changes in net working capital of 40.4 million, which includes 23.2 million of payments made for contingent consideration during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an 18.3 million decrease in tenant improvement allowances received for capital expenditures and leasehold improvements related to the CVP Lease. This is partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in net loss from operations of 8.3 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.6 million, a decrease of 17.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to decreases in purchases of property and equipment and capital expenditures primarily for leasehold improvements related to the CVP Lease. These leasehold improvements were tenant improvements and were reimbursed from the Landlord. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 52.2 million, an increase of 44.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. The net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from 51.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from an underwritten offering of common stock and a concurrent private placement, 0.6 million from the issuance of common stock from our ATM facility, and 0.3 million from our ESPP. The net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from 15.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the Subscription Agreements, partially offset by milestone payments to Indi of 7.6 million and payments of debt issuance costs of 0.8 million.

There have been no other significant changes to our future contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain of these estimates significantly influence the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies are described in greater detail below and in Note 2 to our condensed financial statements in Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on March 1, 2024. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for our goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for our arrangements with our customers, we perform a five-step process, which includes: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) we satisfy our performance obligations. The Company generates revenues from (i) Diagnostic Tests and (ii) assay development, testing services, and licensing our technologies (Biopharmaceutical Services and other revenue). 
 The Company recognizes revenues related to blood-based lung diagnostic billings based on estimates of the amounts ultimately expected to be collected from customers on a portfolio approach. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, the Company considers factors such as test type, payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and the Company, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. Variable consideration, if any, is estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and adjusted as better estimates become available. These estimates require significant judgment by management. 
 The Company also provides services to patients with whom the Company does not have contracts as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification 606 (ASC 606). The Company recognizes revenue for these patients when contracts, as defined in ASC 606, are established at the amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled, or when the Company receives substantially all of the consideration subsequent to satisfaction and delivery of the performance obligations. 
 In addition, other revenue includes amounts derived from licensing our PCR technologies to our international laboratory partners. We are compensated through royalty-based payments for the licensed technology and, depending on the nature of the technology licensing arrangements and considering factors including but not limited to enforceable right to payment and payment terms, and if an asset with alternative use is created, these revenues are recognized in the period when royalty-bearing sales occur.

 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company 
 We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including the requirement that our internal control over financial reporting be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), certain requirements related to the disclosure of executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, the requirement that we hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 
 We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than 1.24 billion in annual revenue; (ii) the date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least 700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (iv) until December 31, 2025 (the year ended December 31st following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering). 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which: (i) the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our indebtedness, including our outstanding Perceptive Term Loan. As of September 30, 2024, we had 40.0 million outstanding on the Perceptive Term Loan Facility which has an annual rate equal to the greater of (a) forward-looking one-month term SOFR as posted by CME Group Inc. and (b) 3.0 per annum, plus an applicable margin of 9.0 . Historically, we have not entered into derivative agreements such as interest rate caps and swaps to manage our floating interest rate exposure. 
 Periodically throughout the year, we have maintained balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. Our cash and cash equivalents are funds held in checking and bank savings accounts, primarily at one U.S. financial institution. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We continually monitor our positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which we invest. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have an estimated 0.4 million impact per year on our financial position and results of operations, based on the current Perceptive Term Loan principal remaining outstanding through maturity. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well 
 36 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially effect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 37 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or investigations which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed March 1, 2024, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, if applicable, include a discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information we previously disclosed and, except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These risk factors may not describe every risk facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 FDA is phasing out its general policy of enforcement discretion and will regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. 
 On September 29, 2023, FDA announced a proposed rule to amend its regulations to explicitly regulate laboratory developed tests (LDTs) as in vitro diagnostic tests in accordance with the agency s regulatory authority over medical devices. The FDA finalized its rule on May 6, 2024 and announced that the agency will phase-out its LDT enforcement discretion policy in gradual stages over a total period of four years. LDTs that fall within targeted enforcement discretion policies may be exempt from some of these requirements. 
 Under the final rule, our tests that are currently offered as LDTs could become subject to certain statutory and regulatory provisions that are applicable to medical devices, including but not limited to, medical device reporting and correction and removal reporting requirements, quality systems regulations, registration and listing requirements, and premarket review requirements. Laboratories offering high-risk tests that will be subject to premarket authorization application requirements or licensure under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, will need to ensure that the appropriate submission is received by the FDA before November 6, 2027. Laboratories offering moderate-risk or low-risk tests that will be subject to De Novo authorization or premarket notification submissions will need to ensure that the appropriate submission is received by the FDA before May 6, 2028. Other regulatory requirements will be gradually phased in beginning on May 6, 2025. 
 Failure to comply with applicable requirements under the relevant timeframes could cause us to lose the ability to perform our tests, experience disruptions to our business, or become subject to administrative or judicial enforcement actions, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For more information regarding these risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on March 1, 2024, under the heading " Risks Related to our Governmental Regulation Our current line of diagnostic tests is covered under CLIA and CMS, but the FDA may end its general policy of enforcement discretion and regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Changes in the way the FDA regulates tests performed by laboratories like ours could result in delay or additional expense in offering our tests and tests that we may develop in the future." 
 Legal challenges have been filed in federal district court over the agency s authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices, and the outcome of such litigation and its impact on FDA s plan to implement the requirements are uncertain. Congress has also considered legislation to establish a new comprehensive regulatory framework that would provide oversight over LDTs. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 On April 5, 2024, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreements, pursuant to which we sold 760,857 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which, subject to stockholder approval and certain beneficial ownership limitations set by each holder pursuant to the Series A Certificate of Designation, would automatically convert into 40 shares of Common Stock for each share of Series A Preferred Stock, for an aggregate of up to 30,434,280 shares of our common stock and an aggregate purchase price of 35.0 million. The Private Placement Preferred Shares were offered and sold in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act, in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) thereof. Each of the investors represented that it was an accredited investor, as defined in Regulation D, and acquired the securities for investment only and not with a view towards, or for resale in connection with, the public sale or distribution thereof. The Private Placement Preferred Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Concurrent Private Placement for commercial expansion of sales, supporting its product pipeline, research and development and for general corporate purposes. 
 38 

BIODESIX, INC. Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

 In connection with the Concurrent Private Placement, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated April 5, 2024 (the Registration Rights Agreement), with the Investors, which provides that the Company will register the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company was required to prepare and file an initial registration statement with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than April 23, 2024 (the Filing Deadline), and to use reasonable best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective within 50 days after the closing of the Concurrent Private Placement, subject to the approval of the conversion of the Concurrent Private Placement Shares being received at the Company s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. 
 On May 21, 2024, the Company held its 2024 annual meeting of stockholders in which the Conversion Proposal and Issuance Proposal were approved by the Company's stockholders. Upon approval, each share of Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 40 shares of Common Stock and, on May 23, 2024, the Company issued 30,434,280 shares of Common Stock in exchange for all Series A Preferred Stock.
