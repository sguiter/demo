 million . The financial statements of Flywheel Digital are included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024. The acquisition of Flywheel Digital did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is not expected to do so for the remainder of the year. The principal tangible assets and liabilities acquired were net working capital, and the intangible assets acquired were primarily comprised of customer relationships, intellectual property, trade name and goodwill.

 . The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the favorable impact from the resolution of certain non-U.S. tax positions of million. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes an increase of approximately million in income tax expense related to a lower tax benefit in certain jurisdictions for the real estate and other repositioning costs in the period and an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate, partially offset by approximately million of favorable impacts from the resolution of certain non-U.S. tax positions. 
 Numerous foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation to adopt a minimum effective tax rate described in the Global Anti-Base Erosion, or Pillar Two, model rules issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD. Under such rules, a minimum effective tax rate of 15 would apply to multinational companies with consolidated revenue above 750 million. 
 Under the Pillar Two rules, a company would be required to determine a combined effective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under the Pillar Two rules is less than 15 , a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15 . We are continuing to monitor the pending implementation of Pillar Two by individual countries and the potential effects of Pillar Two on our business. The provisions effective in 2024 do not have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
 At September 30, 2024, our unrecognized tax benefits were million. Of this amount, approximately million would affect our effective tax rate upon resolution of the uncertain tax positions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 The unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, including our critical accounting estimates, and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report, should be read in conjunction with our 2023 10-K. In the following tables, dollars are presented in millions, except share amounts. 
 
 Given our size and breadth, we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators. The key performance indicators we focus on are revenue growth, operating income, and EBITA (defined as earnings before interest, income taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets) and EBITA margin (defined as EBITA divided by revenue). We analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth, including growth by principal regional market, practice area and marketing discipline, the impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes, growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, and growth from our largest clients. Variability in operating expenses is analyzed in the following categories: cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG A, and depreciation and amortization. 
 
 Financial Performance 
 Worldwide revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 304.5 million, or 8.5 , to 3,882.6 million, compared to 3,578.1 million in the prior year quarter. Worldwide organic revenue growth (defined below) increased revenue 231.3 million, or 6.5 , reflecting increased client spending across most of our disciplines, primarily driven by our Advertising Media, Public Relations and Experiential disciplines. Our Public Relations discipline was helped by spending on the upcoming U.S. elections, and the Experiential discipline benefited from the Summer Olympics. Substantially all of our major geographic markets had positive organic growth compared to the prior year period. Changes in foreign exchange rates period-over-period reduced revenue 1.2 million, or 0.1 . Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, increased revenue 74.4 million, or 2.1 , primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 (see Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements). 
 Worldwide revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 735.6 million, or 6.9 , to 11,366.9 million, compared to 10,631.3 million in the prior year period. Worldwide organic revenue growth increased revenue 556.5 million, or 5.2 , reflecting increased client spending in our Advertising Media, Precision Marketing, Experiential and Healthcare disciplines and in all of our major geographic markets compared to the prior year period. The Experiential discipline benefited from the Summer Olympics. Changes in foreign exchange rates period-over-period reduced revenue 41.3 million, or 0.4 . Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, increased revenue 220.4 million, or 2.1 , primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 (see Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements) and acquisition activity in the second half of 2023, partially offset by dispositions in the Execution Support discipline in the first half of 2023. 
 The period-over-period change in worldwide revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, in our fundamental disciplines was: Advertising Media increased 174.5 million, Precision Marketing increased 77.3 million, Public Relations increased 22.0 million, Healthcare decreased 3.1 million, Branding Retail Commerce decreased 12.6 million, Experiential increased 43.7 million, and Execution Support increased 2.7 million.

 2) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses included 57.8 million 42.9 million after-tax) of repositioning costs, primarily related to severance, which reduced diluted net income per share- Omnicom Group Inc. by 0.22. There were no repositioning costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating expenses included real estate operating lease impairment charges, severance, and other exit costs of 191.5 million 145.5 million after-tax) related to repositioning actions we took in the first and second quarters of 2023 to reduce our real estate requirements, rebalance our workforce, and consolidate operations in certain markets. In addition, in the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a gain of 78.8 million 55.9 million after tax) on disposition of certain of our research businesses in the Execution Support discipline. There were no repositioning costs for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net impact of these actions reduced diluted net income per share- Omnicom Group Inc. by 0.44 (see Notes 10 and 11 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements). 
 3) Beginning with the three months ended March 31, 2024, EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets. As a result, we reclassified the prior year period to be consistent with the revised definition, which reduced EBITA from previously reported amounts. We believe EBITA is useful in evaluating the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets on operating performance and allows for comparability between reporting periods, the after-tax impact of which on diluted net income per share- Omnicom Group Inc. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.08 and 0.24, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.06 and 0.17, respectively. 
 
 Our Business 
 Omnicom is a strategic holding company providing data-inspired, creative marketing and sales solutions to many of the largest global companies. Our portfolio of companies includes our global networks, BBDO, DDB, TBWA, Omnicom Media Group, the DAS Group of Companies, and the Communications Consultancy Network. All of our global networks integrate their service offerings with the Omnicom branded practice areas, including Omnicom Health Group, Omnicom Precision Marketing Group, Omnicom Commerce Group, Omnicom Advertising Collective, Omnicom Public Relations Group, Omnicom Brand Consulting Group, Flywheel Digital and Omnicom Production, a new practice area that brings together Omnicom's global production capabilities, as well as our Experiential businesses and Execution Support businesses, which includes Omnicom Specialty Marketing Group. 
 On a global, pan-regional, and local basis, our networks, practice areas, and agencies provide a comprehensive range of solutions in the following fundamental disciplines: Advertising Media, Precision Marketing, Public Relations, Healthcare, Branding Retail Commerce, Experiential, and Execution Support. Advertising Media includes creative services across digital and traditional media, strategic media planning and buying, performance media, data analytics services, and Omnicom Production. Precision Marketing includes digital and direct marketing, digital transformation consulting, e-commerce operations, media execution, market intelligence and data and analytics. Public Relations services include corporate communications, crisis management, public affairs and media and media relations services. Healthcare includes corporate communications and advertising and media services to global healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Branding Retail Commerce services include brand and product consulting, strategy and research and retail marketing. Experiential marketing services include live and digital events and experience design and execution. Execution Support includes field marketing, sales support, digital and physical merchandising, as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services. Our geographic markets include the Americas, which includes North America and Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific. 
 Our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our networks, practice areas and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. Our fundamental business principle is that our clients specific marketing requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model requires that multiple agencies within Omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure. This collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients marketing requirements in a consistent and 
 16 

comprehensive manner. We use our client-centric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients, moving into new markets and obtaining new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that currently serve or could serve our existing clients. In addition to collaborating through our client service models, our agencies, practice areas and networks collaborate across internally developed technology platforms. Annalect and Omni, our proprietary data and analytics platforms, serve as the strategic resource for all of our agencies, practice areas and networks to share when developing client service strategies across our virtual networks. These platforms provide precision marketing and insights at scale across creative, media and other disciplines. 
 We believe generative AI will have a significant effect on how we provide services to our clients and how we enhance the productivity of our people. As with any new technology, we are working closely with our clients and technology partners to take advantage of the benefits of AI while being mindful of its limitations, risks, and privacy concerns. We are committed to responsible AI practices and collaboration to harness AI s potential, while evaluating related risks, such as ethical considerations, public perception and reputational concerns, intellectual property protection, regulatory compliance, privacy and data security concerns and our ability to effectively adopt this new emerging technology. The rapidly developing nature of AI technology makes it difficult to assess the full impact on our business at this time. 
 As a provider of data-inspired, creative marketing and sales solutions, we operate in all major markets and have a large and diverse client base. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, our largest client accounted for 2.8 of our revenue, and our 100 largest clients, which represent many of the world s major marketers, accounted for approximately 54.3 of our revenue. Our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy with no one industry representing more than 16 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Although our revenue is generally balanced between the United States and international markets, and we have a large and diverse client base, we are not immune to general economic downturns. 
 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 Global economic disruptions, including geopolitical events, international hostilities, acts of terrorism, public health crises, high and sustained inflation in countries that comprise our major markets, high interest rates, and labor and supply chain issues could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We monitor economic conditions closely, as well as client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments. 
 Revenue is typically lower in the first and third quarters and higher in the second and fourth quarters, reflecting client spending patterns during the year and additional project work that usually occurs in the fourth quarter. Certain global events targeted by major marketers for advertising expenditures, such as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics, and certain national events, such as the U.S. election process, may affect our revenue period-over-period in certain businesses. Typically, these events do not have a significant impact on our revenue in any period.

Revenue 
 
 The components of period-over-period revenue change in the United States Domestic and the remainder of the world International ): Total Domestic International Three months ended September 30, 2023 
 3,578.1 1,868.8 1,709.3 Components of revenue change: Foreign exchange rate impact (1.2) (0.1) (1.2) (0.1) Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue 74.4 2.1 50.1 2.7 24.3 1.4 Organic growth 231.3 6.5 120.8 6.5 110.5 6.5 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 3,882.6 8.5 2,039.7 9.1 1,842.9 7.8 
 Total Domestic International Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 10,631.3 5,531.6 5,099.7 Components of revenue change: Foreign exchange rate impact (41.3) (0.4) (41.3) (0.8) Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue 220.4 2.1 150.8 2.7 69.6 1.4 Organic growth 556.5 5.2 316.6 5.7 239.9 4.7 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 11,366.9 6.9 5,999.0 8.4 5,367.9 5.3 
 The components and percentages are calculated as follows: 
 Foreign exchange rate impact is calculated by translating the current period s local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue (in this case 3,883.8 million and 11,408.2 million for the Total column for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively). The foreign exchange impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue 3,882.6 million less 3,883.8 million and 11,366.9 million less 11,408.2 million for the Total column for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively). 
 Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of dispositions through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the table. 
 Organic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact, and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue components from total revenue growth. 
 The percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component 3,578.1 million and 10,631.3 million for the Total column for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively). 
 Changes in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar affect our results of operations and financial position. For the most part, because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency, the economic impact on operating margin is minimized. Assuming exchange rates at October 11, 2024 remain unchanged, we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates will increase revenue by 1.0 for the fourth quarter and be flat for the full year. Based on our acquisition and disposition activity to date, we expect that the net impact will increase revenue by 1.8 for the fourth quarter and 2.0 for the full year.

Revenue by Discipline 
 To monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients, we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following categories: Advertising Media, Precision Marketing, Branding Retail Commerce, Experiential, Execution Support, Public Relations, and Healthcare. 
 The period-over-period change in revenue and organic growth by discipline: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 of Revenue of Revenue Change Organic Growth Advertising Media 2,083.7 53.7 1,909.2 53.4 174.5 9.4 Precision Marketing 461.0 11.9 383.7 10.7 77.3 0.8 Public Relations 414.4 10.6 392.4 11.0 22.0 4.3 Healthcare 338.7 8.7 341.8 9.5 (3.1) (1.1) Branding Retail Commerce 199.0 5.1 211.6 5.9 (12.6) (5.4) Experiential 177.0 4.6 133.3 3.7 43.7 35.3 Execution Support 208.8 5.4 206.1 5.8 2.7 0.3 Revenue 3,882.6 3,578.1 304.5 6.5

 The period-over-period change in worldwide revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, in our fundamental disciplines was: Advertising Media increased 174.5 million, Precision Marketing increased 77.3 million, Public Relations increased 22.0 million, Healthcare decreased 3.1 million, Branding Retail Commerce decreased 12.6 million, Experiential increased 43.7 million, and Execution Support increased 2.7 million. Worldwide organic revenue growth increased revenue 231.3 million, or 6.5 , primarily reflecting increased client spending across most of our disciplines, primarily driven by Advertising Media, led by Media, as well as Public Relations and Experiential disciplines compared to the prior year period. Our Public Relations discipline was helped by spending on the upcoming U.S. election cycle, and the Experiential discipline benefited from the Summer Olympics. The organic growth was partially offset by underperformance in our Branding Retail Commerce discipline. Changes in foreign exchange rates period-over-period reduced revenue 1.2 million, or 0.1 . The decrease in revenue from foreign exchange translation was primarily related to the weakening of some currencies, including the Brazilian Real, against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the British Pound, Euro and Australian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, increased revenue 74.4 million, or 2.1 , primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024, which is included in our Precision Marketing discipline. 
 The period-over-period change in worldwide revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in our fundamental disciplines was: Advertising Media increased 440.1 million, Precision Marketing increased 225.3 million, Public Relations increased 61.4 million, Healthcare increased 5.9 million, Branding Retail Commerce decreased 33.2 million, Experiential increased 77.5 million, and Execution Support decreased 41.4 million. Worldwide organic revenue growth increased revenue 556.5 million, or 5.2 , primarily reflecting increased client spending in Advertising Media, led by Media, as well as Experiential, Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines compared to the prior year period. The Experiential discipline benefited from the Summer Olympics. Organic growth was partially offset by underperformance in our Branding Retail Commerce and Execution Support disciplines. Changes in foreign exchange rates period-over-period reduced revenue 41.3 million, or 0.4 . The decrease in revenue from foreign exchange translation was primarily related to the weakening of several currencies, including the Japanese Yen and Brazilian Real, against the U.S. Dollar, 
 20 

partially offset by the strengthening of the British Pound, Colombian Peso and the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, increased revenue 220.4 million, or 2.1 , primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024, which is included in our Precision Marketing discipline, and acquisition activity in the second half of 2023, partially offset by dispositions in our Execution Support discipline in the first half of 2023. 
 In the normal course of business, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors. Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients. Our largest client represented 2.8 and 3.0 of revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 19.4 and 54.3 of revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 20.4 and 54.4 of revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 The period-over-period increase in worldwide revenue across our geographic markets for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was: North America 170.8 million, or 8.6 , Latin America 0.3 million, or 0.3 , Europe 64.0 million, or 6.3 , the Middle East and Africa 11.7 million, or 22.7 , and Asia-Pacific 57.7 million, or 13.5 . 
 The period-over-period increase in worldwide revenue across our geographic markets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was: North America 454.5 million, or 7.7 , Latin America 44.6 million, or 17.3 , Europe 174.2 million, or 5.8 , the Middle East and Africa 9.4 million, or 4.7 , and Asia-Pacific 52.9 million, or 4.2 . 
 North America 
 In North America, organic revenue growth period-over-period for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by strong performance in the United States, especially in the Advertising Media discipline, led by our media business, and our Precision Marketing, Experiential, and Public Relations disciplines. Our Public Relations discipline was helped by spending on the upcoming U.S. election cycle, and the Experiential discipline benefited from the Summer Olympics. The organic growth was partially offset by underperformance in our Branding Retail Commerce discipline. Acquisitions net of dispositions positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 and acquisitions in the prior year in our Public Relations discipline. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the acquisition growth was partially offset by dispositions in the Execution Support discipline in the first half of 2023.

Latin America 
 In Latin America, organic revenue growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased in substantially all our disciplines, led by Advertising Media, and in substantially all countries in the region, compared to the prior year period. The weakening of several currencies, including the Brazilian Real, against the U.S. Dollar decreased revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, partially offset by the strengthening of the Colombian Peso against the U.S. Dollar in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Acquisitions positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to acquisition activity in our Advertising Media discipline in the prior year and the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024. 
 EMEA 
 In Europe, compared to the prior year period, organic revenue growth for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by strong performance in our Advertising Media discipline, led by our media business, and in our Experiential and Execution Support disciplines, partially offset by under performance in our Precision Marketing, Branding Retail Commerce and Public Relations disciplines. Foreign currency changes increased revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the British Pound and the Euro against the U.S. Dollar period-over-period. Acquisitions, net of dispositions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 and acquisition activity in our Advertising Media discipline in the current and prior year.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase from our acquisition activity was partially offset by the divestiture of our research businesses in the Execution Support discipline in the first half of 2023. 
 In the U.K., organic revenue decreased by 0.2 period-over-period for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In Continental Europe, which includes the Euro Zone and the other European countries, organic growth for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 6.8 was led by Italy, France, Spain and Germany and in most disciplines, partially offset by underperformance in our Branding Retail Commerce and Precision Marketing disciplines. 
 In the U.K., organic revenue increased by 3.2 period-over-period for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was led by our Advertising Media discipline, along with most of our other disciplines, but was partially offset by weakness in our Public Relations discipline. In Continental Europe, which includes the Euro Zone and the other European countries, organic growth of 5.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was led by Germany, Italy and Spain and in most disciplines, partially offset by underperformance in our Branding Retail Commerce and Public Relations disciplines. 
 In the Middle East and Africa, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, organic revenue increased period-over-period, driven by our Experiential and our Advertising Media disciplines. 
 Asia-Pacific 
 In Asia-Pacific, organic revenue increased period-over-period for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Organic growth led by our Advertising Media discipline was partially offset by underperformance in our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines. Most markets in the region, especially Australia, India and China, had positive organic growth as compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency changes increased revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Australian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar period-over-period. Acquisition activity, including the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024, increased revenue compared to the prior year periods. 
 In Asia-Pacific, organic revenue increased period-over-period for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Organic growth in our Advertising Media discipline was partially offset by underperformance in our Experiential discipline, which faced difficult comparisons to the prior year periods and in our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines. Most markets in the region, especially Australia, India, Hong Kong, Philippines, China, Thailand and Korea, had positive organic growth as compared to the prior year period. Foreign currency changes decreased revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Japanese Yen, Chinese Reminbi and Australian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar period-over-period.

 We measure cost of services in two distinct categories: salary and service costs and occupancy and other costs. As a service business, salary and service costs make up the significant portion of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services. Salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits, freelance labor, third-party service costs, and third-party incidental costs. Third-party service costs include vendor costs when we act as principal in providing services to our clients. Third-party incidental costs that are required to be included in revenue primarily consist of client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that are billed back to the client directly at our cost. Occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services, including office rent and other occupancy costs, equipment rent, technology costs, general office expenses and other expenses. Adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign currencies from period to period impact our results of operations and financial position when we translate our financial statements from local foreign currencies to the U.S. Dollar. However, substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency, mitigating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating margin percentage. As a result, the changes in our operating expenses period-over-period from foreign currency translation were in line with the percentage impact from changes in foreign currencies on revenue for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 265.2 million, or 8.8 , to 3,282.5 million from 3,017.3 million, compared to the prior year period. 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 604.3 million, or 6.6 , to 9,777.6 million from 9,173.3 million, compared to the prior year period. Included in operating expenses for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 is the impact of repositioning costs, primarily related to severance of 57.8 million. Included in operating expenses for the nine-months ended September 30, 2023 is the net impact of the gain on disposition of subsidiary in our Execution Support discipline of 78.8 million and repositioning costs related to real estate and other exit charges and severance of 191.5 million incurred in the period (see Notes 10 and 11 to the unaudited financial statements). 
 
 Operating Expenses - Salary and Service Costs 
 Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, are comprised of salary and related costs, third-party service costs, and third-party incidental costs. 
 Salary and service costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 209.5 million, or 8.1 , to 2,796.0 million, compared to the prior year period. Salary and related costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 90.2 million, or 5.1 , to 1,846.9 million, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Flywheel Digital. These costs decreased as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to the reduction arising from our ongoing repositioning actions and global employee mix. Third-party service costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 105.7 million, or 15.6 , to 784.5 million, primarily as a result of organic growth in our Advertising Media and Experiential disciplines. Third-party incidental costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13.6 million, or 9.0 , to 164.6 million. 
 Salary and service costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 541.5 million, or 7.0 , to 8,288.7 million, compared to the prior year period. Salary and related costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 224.4 million, or 4.2 , to 5,531.1 million, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Flywheel Digital. These costs decreased as a 
 24 

percentage of revenue, primarily due to the reduction arising from our ongoing repositioning actions. Third-party service costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 259.9 million, or 12.8 , to 2,293.8 million, primarily as a result of organic growth in our Advertising Media and Experiential disciplines. Third-party incidental costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 57.2 million, or 14.1 , to 463.8 million. 
 
 Operating Expenses - Occupancy and Other Costs 
 Occupancy and other costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, increased by 37.0 million, or 12.8 , to 325.6 million and increased by 76.0 million, or 8.7 , to 953.9 million, respectively, primarily resulting from our acquisition activity. Increased office and other related costs were partially offset by lower rent expense in the periods. 
 
 Operating Expenses - Selling, General Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses primarily consist of third-party marketing costs, professional fees, compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices, including group-wide finance and accounting, treasury, legal and governance, human resource oversight and similar costs. SG A expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 9.7 million and 17.7 million, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to professional fees related to strategic initiatives. 
 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 39.3 million to 600.1 million, and operating margin decreased to 15.5 from 15.7 compared to the same period in 2023. EBITA increased 45.8 million to 622.3 million, and EBITA margin decreased to 16.0 from 16.1 . 
 Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 131.3 million to 1,589.3 million, and operating margin increased to 14.0 from 13.7 compared to the same period in 2023. EBITA increased 151.3 million to 1,654.5 million, and EBITA margin increased to 14.6 from 14.1 . The effect of the repositioning actions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reduced operating income and EBITA by 57.8 million and decreased both operating margin and EBITA margin by 0.5 . The net effect of the real estate and other repositioning costs and the gain on disposition of subsidiaries in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reduced both operating income and EBITA by 112.7 million, and reduced both operating margin and EBITA margin by 1.1 . 
 
 Net Interest Expense 
 Net interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.1 million and 23.9 million period-over-period to 40.4 million and 108.9 million, respectively. 
 Interest expense on debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13.8 million and 19.2 million period-over-period to 61.6 million and 169.0 million, respectively, primarily related to the issuance in the first quarter of 2024 of 600 million 3.70 Senior Notes due 2032, or 2032 Notes, and the issuance in the third quarter of 2024 of 600 million 5.30 Senior Notes due 2034, or 2034 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Notes, along with available cash, will be used to fund the repayment of our 750 million 3.65 Senior Notes due November 1, 2024 (see Note 6 to the unaudited financial statements). 
 Interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.8 million period-over-period to 26.0 million, principally due to higher cash balances from the issuance of the 600 million 2034 notes. Interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.9 million period-over-period to 74.0 million. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was flat period-over-period at 26.3 . The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the favorable impact from the resolution of certain non-U.S. tax positions of 7.5 million. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes an increase of approximately 10.7 million in income tax expense related to a lower tax benefit in certain jurisdictions for the real estate and other repositioning costs in the period and an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate, partially offset by approximately 10.0 million of favorable impacts from the resolution of certain non-U.S. tax positions. 
 
 Net Income and Net Income Per Share - Omnicom Group, Inc. 
 Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.0 million to 385.9 million from 371.9 million. The period-over-period increase is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. increased to 1.95 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.86 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the factors described above and the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the repurchases of our common stock. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no repositioning costs. 
 25 

Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 66.9 million to 1,032.6 million from 965.7 million. The period-over-period increase is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. increased to 5.19 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.78 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the factors described above, and the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the repurchases of our common stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of repositioning costs reduced net income - Omnicom Group Inc. by 42.9 million and diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by 0.22. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net impact of the real estate other repositioning costs and gain on disposition of subsidiaries reduced net income - Omnicom Group Inc. by 89.6 million and diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by 0.44. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in describing our performance. We use EBITA and EBITA Margin as additional operating performance measures, which excludes from operating income the non-cash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets. We believe EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business and allows for comparability between the periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash Sources and Requirements 
 The primary sources of our short-term liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents. Additional liquidity sources include our 2.5 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, terminating on June 2, 2028, and the ability to issue up to 2 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated commercial paper and issue up to the equivalent of 500 million in British Pounds or Euro under a Euro commercial paper program. In addition, certain of our international subsidiaries have uncommitted credit lines that are guaranteed by Omnicom, aggregating 510.3 million. Our liquidity sources fund our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending. The 600 million Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement automatically terminated on July 15, 2024. 
 Working capital, which we define as current assets minus current liabilities, is our principal non-discretionary funding requirement. Our working capital requirement typically peaks during the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation, income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations. In addition, we have contractual obligations related to our long-term debt (principal and interest payments), recurring business operations, primarily related to lease obligations, and acquisition related obligations. Our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 898.1 million from December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, we used 191.5 million of cash in operating activities, which included the use for operating capital of 1.6 billion, primarily related to our typical working capital cycle. Discretionary spending for the first nine months of 2024 was 1.9 billion, compared to 1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Discretionary spending for the first nine months of 2024 was comprised of capital expenditures of 93.6 million, dividends paid to common shareholders of 416.0 million, dividends paid to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of 64.0 million, repurchases of our common stock, net of proceeds from vesting of restricted stock awards and related tax benefits and common stock sold to our employee stock purchase plan of 358.5 million, and the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Flywheel Digital and acquisition of additional shares of noncontrolling interests, and payment of contingent purchase price obligations of 953.4 million. Discretionary spending was partially offset by the proceeds from financing activities of approximately 1.2 billion, which includes the issuance in the third quarter of 2024 of 600 million 5.30 Senior Notes due 2034, or 2034 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Notes, along with available cash, will be used to fund the repayment of our 750 million 3.65 Senior Notes due November 1, 2024 (see Note 6 to the unaudited financial statements). 
 Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our non-discretionary cash requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, and over the longer term, our Credit Facility is available to fund our working capital and contractual obligations. 
 
 Cash Management 
 Our regional treasury centers in North America, Europe and Asia manage our cash and liquidity. Each day, operations with excess funds invest those funds with their regional treasury center. Likewise, operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center. Treasury centers with excess cash invest on a short-term basis with third parties, with maturities generally ranging from overnight to 90 days. Certain treasury centers have notional pooling arrangements that are used to manage their cash and set-off foreign exchange imbalances. The arrangements require each treasury center to have its own notional pool account and to maintain a notional positive account balance. Additionally, under the terms of the arrangement, set-off of foreign exchange positions are limited to the long and short positions within their own account. To the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity, they can issue up to a total of 2 billion of U.S. Dollar-denominated commercial paper and issue up to the equivalent of 500 million in British Pounds or Euro under a Euro commercial paper program, or borrow under the Credit Facility, or the uncommitted credit lines. This process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively, as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances. In countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis, we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines. We have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents, and we have deposit limits for each institution. In countries where we conduct treasury operations, generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the Credit Facility. These institutions generally have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit ratings. In countries where we do not conduct treasury operations, all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards. 
 At September 30, 2024, our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 1.9 billion of our total cash and cash equivalents of 3.5 billion. Substantially all of the cash is available to us, net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the United States. 
 At September 30, 2024, our net debt position, which we define as total debt, including short-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents, increased 2.2 billion to 3.4 billion from December 31, 2023. The increase in net debt primarily resulted from the use of cash of 191.5 million for operating activities, which included the use for operating capital of 1.6 billion, primarily related to 
 27 

our typical working capital requirement during the period, discretionary spending of 1.9 billion, as discussed above, and the net decrease from foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and our foreign currency denominated debt of 38 million.

 Net debt is a Non-GAAP liquidity measure. This presentation, together with the comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measures, reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management. Non-GAAP liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. 
 
 Debt Instruments and Related Covenants 
 On August 2, 2024, Omnicom issued 600 million 5.30 Senior Notes due 2034, or 2034 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were 592.4 million. The net proceeds from the issuance, along with available cash, will be used to fund the repayment of our 750 million 3.65 Senior Notes due November 1, 2024. 
 On March 6, 2024, Omnicom Finance Holdings plc, or OFH, a U.K.-based wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom, issued 600 million of the 2032 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were 643.1 million and were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. 
 The 2.45 Senior Notes due 2030, 4.20 Senior Notes due 2030, 2.60 Senior Notes due 2031 and 5.30 Senior Notes due 2034 are senior unsecured obligations of Omnicom that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. 
 Omnicom and its wholly owned finance subsidiary, Omnicom Capital Inc., or OCI, are co-obligors under the 3.65 Senior Notes due 2024 and the 3.60 Senior Notes due 2026. These notes are a joint and several liability of Omnicom and OCI, and Omnicom unconditionally guarantees OCI s obligations with respect to the notes.

The Credit Facility has a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a Leverage Ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash charges) of no more than 3.5 times for the most recently ended 12-month period. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with this covenant as our Leverage Ratio was 2.8 times. The Credit Facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. 
 At September 30, 2024, our long-term and short-term debt was rated BBB+ and A2 by S P and Baa1 and P2 by Moody s. Our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of these borrowings are affected by market conditions and our credit ratings. The long-term debt indentures and Credit Facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings. 
 
 Credit Markets and Availability of Credit 
 In light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions, we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions, and we will continue to manage our discretionary expenditures. We will also continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients. We believe that these actions, in addition to the availability of our Credit Facility, are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital needs and our discretionary spending. Information regarding our Credit Facility is provided in Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 We have the ability to fund our day-to-day liquidity, including working capital, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under the Credit Facility. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no drawings under the Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility, and no commercial paper issuances. 
 We may issue commercial paper to fund our day-to-day liquidity when needed. However, disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads. To mitigate any disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity, we may borrow under the Credit Facility, or the uncommitted credit lines or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist. We will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any disruptions in the credit markets. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 We provide data-inspired, creative marketing and sales solutions to clients that operate in nearly every sector of the global economy, and we grant credit to qualified clients in the normal course of business. Due to the diversified nature of our client base, we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk, as our largest client represented 2.8 of revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. However, during periods of economic downturn, the credit profiles of our clients could change. 
 In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into contractual commitments with media providers and production companies on behalf of our clients at levels that can substantially exceed the revenue from our services. These commitments are included in accounts payable when the services are delivered by the media providers or production companies. If permitted by local law and the client agreement, many of our agencies purchase media and production services for our clients as an agent for a disclosed principal. In addition, while operating practices vary by country, media type and media vendor, in the United States and certain foreign markets, many of our agencies contracts with media and production providers specify that our agencies are not liable to the media and production providers under the theory of sequential liability until and to the extent we have been paid by our client for the media or production services. 
 Where purchases of media and production services are made by our agencies as a principal or are not subject to the theory of sequential liability, the risk of a material loss as a result of payment default by our clients could increase significantly, and such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. 
 While we use various methods to manage the risk of payment default, including obtaining credit insurance, requiring payment in advance, mitigating the potential loss in the marketplace or negotiating with media providers, these may be insufficient, less available, or unavailable during a severe economic downturn. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 For a more complete understanding of our accounting estimates and policies, the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, readers are encouraged to consider this information together with our discussion of our critical accounting policies under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 10-K. 
 
 Acquisitions and Goodwill 
 We have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions. The evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, geographic coverage, competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses, as well as our experience and judgment. 
 29 

Our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients. Additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know-how of the acquisition targets. Accordingly, as is typical in most service businesses, a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the know-how of the personnel, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not required to be valued separately under U.S. GAAP. For each acquisition, we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately. A significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names. In valuing these identified intangible assets, we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements. 
 We will continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at May 1 each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value (Step 0) or proceeding directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. While there were no trigger events that required us to perform a quantitative test, we performed the annual quantitative impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value, including goodwill. We identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments, which are our six global agency networks. The regional reporting units and practice areas monitor performance and are responsible for the agencies in their region. They report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our key client matrix organization structure for delivering services to clients in their regions. We have concluded that for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting , and in FASB ASC Topic 350. Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients. In addition, the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics, and the employees share similar skill sets. The main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs, and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs, which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software and other overhead expenses. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our virtual client network strategy. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment Review - Estimates and Assumptions 
 We use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (1) the income approach, which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows, (2) comparative market participant multiples for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and (3) when available, consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions. 
 In applying the income approach, we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows DCF for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin, EBITDA, tax rates, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long-term cash flow growth rates. All of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses, economic conditions related to the industry we operate in, as well as conditions in the global economy. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a DCF methodology are: (1) the expected long-term growth rate of our reporting units' cash flows and (2) the weighted average cost of capital WACC for each reporting unit. 
 The long-term growth rate and WACC assumptions used in our evaluations: May 1, 2024 May 1, 2023 Long-Term Growth Rate 3.5 3.5 WACC 10.8 - 11.8 11 - 11.4 
 Long -term growth rate represents our estimate of the long-term growth rate for our industry and the geographic markets we operate in. For the past ten years, the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the Average Nominal GDP, or NGDP, growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue was approximately 3.6 and 4.7 , respectively. We considered this history when determining the long-term growth rates used in our annual impairment test at May 1, 2024. Included in the 10-year history is the full year 2020 that reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our revenue. We believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to NGDP, notwithstanding the volatility of inflationary environments. Based on our past performance, we also believe that our growth rate can exceed NGDP growth in the short-term in the markets we operate in, which are similar across our reporting units. Accordingly, for our annual test as of May 1, 2024, we used an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.5 . 
 When performing the annual impairment test as of May 1, 2024 and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units, we considered the current macroeconomic environment, as well as industry and market specific conditions in 2024. In the first half of 2024, our organic revenue increase was 4.6 , which excluded our net disposition activity and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 30 

The WACC is comprised of: (1) a risk-free rate of return, (2) a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market, (3) an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units, and (4) a current after-tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units, each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt. 
 Our six reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them. These differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units. In addition, these differences as well as differences in book value, including goodwill, cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units. The goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of Omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded. The remaining three agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result, they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt. Finally, the allocation of goodwill when components are transferred between reporting units is based on relative fair value at the time of transfer. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment Review - Conclusion 
 Based on the results of our impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill as of May 1, 2024 was not impaired, because the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective net book value. For our reporting units with negative book value, we concluded that the fair value of their total assets was in excess of book value. The minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 48 . Notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for WACC and long-term growth rate in our impairment testing were reasonable, we performed a sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit. The results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of May 1, 2024 revealed that if the WACC increased by 1 and/or the long-term growth rate decreased by 1 , the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test. 
 We will continue to perform our impairment test at May 1 each year, unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test. The estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations, but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, but they are subject to change from period to period. Actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation, and it is possible that differences could be significant. A change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a non-cash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk through various strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We use forward foreign exchange contracts as economic hedges to manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We use net investment hedges to manage the volatility of foreign exchange rates on the investment in our foreign subsidiaries. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Using derivatives exposes us to the credit risk that counterparties to the derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. We manage that risk through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the counterparty financial institutions based on specific minimum credit standards and other factors. Our 2023 10-K provides a detailed discussion of the market risks affecting our operations. No material change has occurred in our market risks since the disclosure contained in our 2023 10-K. Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of our foreign currency derivatives and cross currency swaps as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within applicable time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, including our CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that decisions can be made timely with respect to required disclosures, as well as ensuring that the recording, processing, 
 31 

summarization and reporting of information required to be included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are appropriate. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management, with the participation of our CEO, CFO and our agencies, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K, has issued an attestation report on Omnicom s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, dated February 7, 2024.

 2021 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN 
 PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT 
 
 1. Award of PRSUs . Omnicom has granted the Employee that number of PRSUs set forth in the Grant Notice. Each PRSU represents the right to receive one Share. However, unless and until the PRSUs have vested, the Employee shall have no right to any Shares subject thereto. Prior to the actual delivery of any vested Shares, such PRSUs shall represent an unsecured obligation of Omnicom, deliverable (if at all) only from the general assets of Omnicom. 
 2. Dividend Equivalents, Rights as Shareholder and Custody . 
 a) With respect to each PRSU that is outstanding on the record date (the Record Date ), in the event that any dividend or other distribution is paid with respect to shares of Stock, the Employee shall be entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution as follows 
 (i) if the dividends or other distributions are paid in cash to the stockholders of Omnicom, the Employee shall be eligible to receive a cash payment equal to the cash payment that the Employee would have received if the PRSUs with respect to which the Employee is receiving the dividend or other distribution had already been settled in shares of Stock, less applicable tax withholding, provided, that, the cash payment shall be subject to the same vesting requirements and restrictions on transferability as the PRSUs with respect to which they were distributed and shall be considered PRSUs under the terms of this Agreement with respect to forfeiture, transferability and payment timing and 
 (ii) if any such dividends or distributions are paid to the stockholders of Omnicom in shares of Stock, the Employee shall be eligible to receive a number of PRSUs equal to the number of shares of Stock the Employee would have received if the PRSUs with respect to which the Employee is receiving the dividend had already been settled in shares of Stock. Any such additional PRSUs shall be subject to the same vesting requirements and restrictions on transferability as the PRSUs with respect to which they were distributed and shall be considered PRSUs under the terms of this Agreement. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employee is entitled to such dividend or other distribution as a result of holding shares of Stock issued with respect to the settlement of PRSUs on or after the Record Date but prior to the payment of the applicable dividend or other distribution (the Settled PRSUs ), then the Employee shall not also be entitled to receive dividends or other distributions under this paragraph 2(a) with respect to the Settled PRSUs. 
 b) No cash or Shares shall be issued to the Employee prior to the date on which the PRSUs vest. At the time of distribution pursuant to Section 4, Shares evidencing such PRSUs shall be transferred into Employee s brokerage account or participant trust maintained with the administrator of the Plan (the Brokerage Account or, at Omnicom s sole discretion, stock certificate(s) shall be issued and delivered to the Employee (or his her permitted 
 2 

transferees) by Omnicom and any cash shall be paid to the Employee. Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of Omnicom in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until Shares have been deposited in Employee s Brokerage Account or certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) have been issued and recorded on the records of Omnicom or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee. Except as otherwise provided herein, after such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Employee shall have all the rights of a stockholder of Omnicom with respect to voting such Shares and the receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 
 3. Vesting and Forfeiture Committee Discretion. 
 a) Vesting and Forfeiture Generally . Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 3(a)(ii) and (iii), the number of PRSUs that shall become vested and non-forfeitable on the Measurement Date (as defined below) shall equal (rounded up to the nearest full PRSU) (i) the Performance Ratio (as defined below), multiplied by (ii) the total number of PRSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Measurement Date. 
 (i) Calculation of Performance Ratio upon the Measurement Date . When practicable after the end of calendar year , the Committee shall establish a performance ratio (the date on which the performance ratio is determined by the Committee is referred to in this Agreement as the Measurement Date ), which shall determine the number of PRSUs that will vest (such ratio, as determined by the Committee, the Performance Ratio ), based on Omnicom s relative Average Return on Equity as compared to the Average Return on Equity of each member of the Peer Group. The Committee shall determine the Performance Ratio as follows To be specified in each individual award agreement . 
 (i) Discretionary Vesting . The Committee in its sole discretion may accelerate or allow for the vesting of any PRSUs that do not otherwise vest pursuant to this paragraph 3(a). 
 (ii) Forfeiture of PRSUs . 
 (1) Subject to paragraphs 3(b) (d) below, in the event the Employee incurs a Termination of Employment, the Employee s right to vest in any PRSUs that have not vested as of the Termination Date and to receive the Shares related thereto shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date and the Employee shall have no further rights to such PRSUs or the related Shares. 
 (2) Effective as of the Measurement Date, if the Performance Ratio is not the Maximum Performance Ratio, any PRSUs that are no longer eligible to vest pursuant to paragraph 3(a)(i) shall terminate effective as of the Measurement Date and the Employee shall have no further rights to such PRSUs or the related Shares. 
 b) Termination of Employment due to Death . In the event of a Termination of Employment prior to __________ by reason of the death of the Employee, all of the PRSUs shall become vested and non-forfeitable as of the Termination Date. In the event of a Termination of Employment on or after __________ by reason of the death of the Employee, the number of PRSUs that shall become vested and non-forfeitable on the Measurement Date 
 3 

shall equal (rounded up to the nearest full PRSU) (i) the Performance Ratio, multiplied by (ii) the total number of PRSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Termination Date. 
 c) Termination of Employment due to Disability . In the event of a Termination of Employment prior to __________ by reason of the Disability of the Employee, the number of PRSUs that shall become vested and non-forfeitable on the Termination Date as a result of such Termination of Employment (rounded up to the nearest full PRSU) shall equal (A) all of the PRSUs that are outstanding immediately prior to the Termination Date, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full calendar months between January 1, and the Termination Date and the denominator of which shall be __________ , provided, however, that the Committee may determine in its discretion that a greater number of PRSUs shall vest as of the Termination Date in such circumstance. In the event of a Termination of Employment on or after __________ by reason of the Disability of the Employee, the number of PRSUs that shall become vested and non-forfeitable on the Measurement Date shall equal (rounded up to the nearest full PRSU) (i) the Performance Ratio, multiplied by (ii) the total number of PRSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Termination Date. 
 d) Termination of Employment, other than due to Disability or death . In addition, in the event of a Termination of Employment prior to the Measurement Date that occurs for reasons other than due to Disability or death of the Employee, the number of PRSUs that shall become vested and non-forfeitable on the Measurement Date shall equal (rounded up to the nearest full PRSU) (A) the Performance Ratio, multiplied by (B) one of the following 
 (i) In the event of a Termination of Employment on or after __________ and prior to __________ , one-third of the total number of PRSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Termination of Employment (rounded up to the nearest whole share), with the remaining two-thirds of the PRSUs being immediately forfeited on the Termination Date 
 (ii) In the event of a Termination of Employment on or after __________ and prior to __________ , two-thirds of the total number of PRSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Termination of Employment (rounded up to the nearest whole share), with the remaining one-third of the PRSUs being immediately forfeited on the Termination Date 
 (iii) In the event of a Termination of Employment on or after __________ , the total number of PRSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Termination Date. 
 e) The Employee acknowledges that upon a Change in Control prior to a Vesting Date, Article 10 of the Plan shall govern.

 (i) during the Employment Period, directly or indirectly, solicit business on behalf of, render any services to, engage in, or have any ownership interests or other affiliation in, any business or other endeavor, which is engaged in the business of the same nature as or competitive with any member of the Group provided, however, that nothing contained in this clause (i) shall be deemed to prevent the undersigned from owning less than of 1 of the shares of any publicly held corporation engaged in any such business 
 (ii) during the Restricted Period, solicit, render services to or for, or accept from, any Restricted Client, any business of the type performed by any member of the Group for such Restricted Client or persuade or attempt in any manner to persuade any Restricted Client to cease to do business or to reduce the amount of business which any such Restricted Client has customarily done or is reasonably expected to do with members of the Group provided, however , that solely with respect to this paragraph 6(a)(ii), the definition of Restricted Client shall be limited to the particular product, brand or service of such Restricted Client in respect of which at any time during the one-year period prior to the Termination Date, the Employee (A) had a servicing relationship, supervisory responsibility or other involvement, or (B) participated in, supervised or had any responsibility or other involvement in a Pitch and

 c) The Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that for so long as the Employee has been employed by the Company (which term, as used in this paragraph 6(c) and paragraph 6(d) shall be deemed to include any Affiliate of the Company), the Employee has acquired and shall continue to acquire and have access to confidential or proprietary information about the Company and or its Clients, including but not limited to, trade secrets, methods, models, passwords, access to computer files, financial information and records, computer software programs, agreements and or contracts between the Company and its Clients, Client contacts, creative policies and ideas, advertising campaigns, public relations campaigns, creative and media materials, graphic design, budgets, practices, concepts, strategies, methods of operation, financial or business projections of the Company, and information about or received from its Clients (collectively, Confidential Information ).

The Employee hereby acknowledges that he she is aware that such Confidential Information is not readily available to the public and agrees that he she will not at any time utilize such Confidential Information for his her own benefit or for the benefit of third parties.

 7 

concepts and other tangible and intangible materials (collectively, Work Product ), shall be work for hire and that the Company and or Omnicom shall be the exclusive owner of the Work Product and all intellectual property rights associated with the Work Product, including all trademarks, patents or copyrights contained therein. To the extent any Work Product does not qualify as work for hire , the Employee hereby assigns ownership of all such Work Product to the Company and or Omnicom and agrees to take all reasonable measures, at the Company s expense, to perfect such rights in the Company and or Omnicom. The Employee hereby appoints the Company and or Omnicom as his her attorney-in-fact with the limited power to execute assignments of such Work Product. If the Employee is an employee in the State of California, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that the terms of this paragraph shall be subject to the terms of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, a copy of which is annexed to this Agreement. The Employee hereby agrees to advise the Company and or Omnicom promptly in writing of any inventions that he she believes meet the criteria set forth in Section 2870 (which notice shall contain substantiation of such belief). 
 e) Each of the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6 (collectively, the Protective Covenants is separate, distinct and severable. All rights, remedies and benefits expressly provided for in this Section 6 are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights, remedies or benefits provided for by law, in this Section 6 or otherwise, and the exercise of any remedy by a party hereto shall not be deemed an election to the exclusion of any other remedy (any such claim by the other party being hereby waived). The provisions of this Section 6 are not in lieu of, but are in addition to the continuing obligations of the Employee (which the Employee hereby acknowledges) to not use or disclose Confidential Information known to the Employee until any particular piece of Confidential Information becomes generally known to the public (through no action of the Employee), whereupon the restriction on use and disclosure shall cease as to that particular item. The existence of any claim, demand, action or cause of action that the Employee may have against Omnicom or any of its Affiliates, whether predicated pursuant to this Section 6 or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of the provisions of this Section 6 or any other provision or provisions of this Agreement. The covenants contained in this Section 6 for the benefit of Omnicom and the members of the Group, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and may be waived in whole or in part by Omnicom without the consent of any other person, firm, corporation or other form of entity. The temporal duration of the Protective Covenants shall not expire, and shall be tolled, during any period in which the Employee is in violation of any of such Protective Covenants, and all such Protective Covenants shall automatically be extended by the period of such violation. The Employee further acknowledges that he she is a highly regarded employee who considered the terms and conditions upon which he she is electing to be granted the PRSUs and that he she has been advised and has had the opportunity to obtain counsel of his her choice in connection with reviewing and executing this Agreement. 
 f) By acceptance of the grant of PRSUs, the Employee agrees that if the Employee were, without authority, to use or disclose Confidential Information, or otherwise breach any of the Protective Covenants, or threaten to do so, in addition to all other available remedies (including without limitation seeking such damages as it can show it has sustained by reason of such breach), (i) Omnicom and or any member of the Group shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive and other appropriate relief (without being required to post 
 8 

bond or other security and without having to prove the inadequacy of the available remedies at law) to prevent the Employee from doing so, and or (ii) Omnicom (by action of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel of Omnicom) may cause any or all of the following actions to occur (x) the PRSUs granted hereunder shall become void, shall be forfeited and shall terminate effective the date on which the Employee entered into such activity, (y) any vested shares of Stock acquired by the Employee pursuant to the grant hereunder shall be forfeited and returned to Omnicom, and (z) any gain realized by the Employee from the sale or transfer of shares of Stock acquired through the grant hereunder, shall be returned by the Employee to Omnicom. The Employee acknowledges that the harm caused to Omnicom and or members of the Group by the breach or anticipated breach of this Agreement is by its nature irreparable because, among other things, it is not readily susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that would ensue. The Employee consents that any interim or final equitable relief entered by a court of competent jurisdiction shall, at the request of Omnicom and or a member of the Group be entered on consent and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over the Employee, without prejudice to any rights either party may have to appeal from the proceedings that resulted in any grant of such relief.
