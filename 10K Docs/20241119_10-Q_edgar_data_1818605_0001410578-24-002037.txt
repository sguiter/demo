In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. On November 14, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting in lieu of annual general meeting of shareholders (the 2024 Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s shareholders approved, as a special resolution, an amendment to the Company s Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Board the right to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from November 18, 2024 on a monthly basis up to twelve (12) times until November 18, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Board (the 2024 Extension Amendment ). In connection with the 2024 Extension Amendment, shareholders holding ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account (the 2024 Extension Redemption ). As a result of the 2024 Extension Redemption, an aggregate amount of approximately million (approximately per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by November 18, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the Board), as extended by the 2024 Extension Amendment (such period, the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in each case) to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

The Sponsor has agreed to pay per month (or approximately per Public Share not redeemed) that the Company decides to take to complete an initial Business Combination for each calendar month until November 18, 2025, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial Business Combination, for up to an aggregate of . The 2024 Extension Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination, and (b) the date of the liquidation of the Company.

 of such Working Capital Loans may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into units at a price of per unit. Such units would be identical to the Private Units. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU Topic 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the Company currently lacks the liquidity it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be at least one year from the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued as it expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. In addition, the Company may extend the time to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis from November 18, 2024 until November 18, 2025, as determined by the Board. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination during this time period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by November 18, 2025 (if extended by the full amount of time), there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Management has determined that mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution and the liquidity condition raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date these financial statements are issued. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after November 18, 2025. The Company intends to complete a Business Combination before the mandatory liquidation date.

The 2023 Extension Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of our initial Business Combination, and (b) the date of our liquidation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 330,000 and 60,000, respectively, outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Extension Note. As of September 30, 2024, the Sponsor made a total of 330,000 of extension deposits into the Trust Account to extend the time the Company has to complete an initial Business Combination to October 18, 2024. On July 29, 2024, the Company advanced 12,000 from the Company s operating account into the Trust Account on the Sponsor s behalf as a partial extension deposit. On August 6, 2024, the Chief Executive Officer advanced 18,000 to the Company to fully pay the required monthly extension deposit into the Trust Account and to extend the time the Company has to complete an initial Business Combination to August 18, 2024. On August 21, 2024, the Company deposited 30,000 of the amounts received from the Sponsor into the Trust Account to extend the time the Company has to complete an initial Business Combination to September 18, 2024. On September 22, 2024, the Company deposited 30,000 of the amounts received from the Sponsor into the Trust Account to extend the time the Company has to complete an initial Business Combination to October 18, 2024. On October 30, 2024, the Company deposited 30,000 of the amounts received from the Sponsor into the Trust Account to extend the time the Company has to complete an initial Business Combination to November 18, 2024.

 On November 14, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting in lieu of annual general meeting of shareholders (the 2024 Extension Meeting ), at which the Company s shareholders approved, as a special resolution, an amendment to the Company s Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Board the right to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from November 18, 2024 on a monthly basis up to twelve (12) times until November 18, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Board (the 2024 Extension Amendment ). In connection with the 2024 Extension Amendment, shareholders holding 3,229,522 ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account (the 2024 Extension Redemption ). As a result of the 2024 Extension Redemption, an aggregate amount of 36.3 million (approximately 11.24 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. On November 14, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note (the 2024 Extension Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 360,000 to the Sponsor (the 2024 Extension Funds ), pursuant to which the 2024 Extension Funds will be deposited into the Trust Account in monthly installments for the benefit of each Public Share that was not redeemed in connection with the 2024 Extension Amendment. The Sponsor has agreed to pay 30,000 per month (or approximately 0.046 per Public Share not redeemed) that the Company decides to take to complete an initial Business Combination for each calendar month until November 18, 2025, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial Business Combination, for up to an aggregate of 360,000. The 2024 Extension Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination, and (b) the date of the liquidation of the Company. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by November 18, 2025 (or such earlier date as determined by the Board), as extended by the 2024 Extension Amendment (such period, the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in each case) to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Youlife Business Combination On May 17, 2024, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the Business Combination Agreement with Youlife Group Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company Pubco ), the Sponsor, Youlife I Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco First Merger Sub ), Youlife II Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco Second Merger Sub ), and Youlife International Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company Youlife ). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the Youlife Business Combination ), (a) First Merger Sub will merge with and into Youlife (the First Merger ), with Youlife surviving the First Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco and the outstanding shares of Youlife being converted into the right to receive shares of Pubco; and (b) Second Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco and the outstanding securities of the Company being converted into the right to receive substantially equivalent securities of Pubco. On November 13, 2024, the Company, Pubco, the Sponsor, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and Youlife entered into the first amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the BCA Amendment ), to, among other things, (i) adopt an American depository share facility, (ii) revise the scope and terms of certain lock-up provisions applicable to the Sponsor and Youlife shareholders, and (iii) clarify certain matters related to the dual-class share structure of Pubco following the closing (the Closing of the Youlife Business Combination. Under the new American depository share facility, at the Closing, Pubco will issue its ordinary shares in the form of American depository shares Pubco ADSs to the Company and Youlife shareholders holding registered shares, which Pubco ADSs will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market in lieu of Pubco ordinary shares, and the warrants to be issued by Pubco will be exercisable for Pubco ADSs. Upon becoming registered shares, Pubco ordinary shares will be exchangeable for Pubco ADSs.

Under the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements, certain Youlife shareholders agreed not to compete with Pubco during the three-year period following the closing and, during such three-year restricted period, not to solicit employees or customers of Pubco. The Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement also contains customary confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from July 1, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 195,738, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 555,371, offset by operating costs of 326,185 and Chinese income tax of 33,448. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 100,345, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,644,669, offset by operating costs of 1,510,876 and Chinese income tax of 33,448. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 391,367, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 914,783 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 26,564, offset by operating costs of 428,379 and Chinese income tax of 121,601. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 1,080,034, which consists of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 2,143,508 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 16,128, offset by operating costs of 724,967 and Chinese income tax of 354,635.

 Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern On February 17, 2023, we completed our initial public offering of 6,900,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 69,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we completed the sale of 545,000 private units at a price of 10.00 per private unit in the private placement to the sponsor, generating gross proceeds of 5,450,000. Following the initial public offering, the full exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private units, a total of 70,380,000 was placed in the trust account. Transaction costs amounted to 4,366,343 consisting of 2,070,000 of cash underwriting discount, 1,185,493 fair value of representative shares, 12,075 fair value of representative warrants, and 1,098,775 of other offering costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss of 100,345 is reduced by the effect of interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 1,644,669 and increased by the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 948,548, arriving at the net cash used in operating activities was 595,776. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 637,824. Net income of 1,080,034 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 2,143,508 and unrealized gain on marketable securities held in our Trust Account of 16,128. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 441,778 of cash from operating activities. On November 10, 2023, we held the 2023 Extension Meeting, at which our shareholders approved the 2023 Extension Amendment to amend the terms of the Paid Extension and to give the Board the right to extend the date by which we have to consummate a Business combination from November 17, 2023 on a monthly basis up to twelve (12) times until November 18, 2024, or such earlier date as determined by the Board. In connection with the 2023 Extension Amendment, shareholders holding 3,018,308 ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account. As a result, an aggregate amount of 31.9 million (approximately 10.57 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. On November 10, 2023, in connection with the 2023 Extension Amendment, we issued the 2023 Extension Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 360,000 to the sponsor, pursuant to which the Extension Funds will be deposited into the trust account in monthly installments for the benefit of each public share that was not redeemed in connection with the 2023 Extension Amendment. The sponsor has agreed to pay 30,000 per month (or approximately 0.01 per public share not redeemed) that we decide to take to complete our initial business combination for each calendar month until November 18, 2024, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete our initial business combination, for up to an aggregate of 360,000. The 2023 Extension Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, and (b) the date of our liquidation. As of September 30, 2024, there was 330,000 outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Extension Note. On February 26, 2024, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 1,000,000 to the sponsor, for our working capital needs. The 2024 Note does not bear interest and matures upon the earlier of the consummation of an initial Business Combination or the date of liquidation. As of September 30, 2024, total borrowings under this note amounted to 519,888. On November 14, 2024, the Company held the 2024 Extension Meeting, at which the Company s shareholders approved, as a special resolution, an amendment to the Company s Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Board the right to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from November 18, 2024 on a monthly basis up to twelve (12) times until November 18, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Board (the 2024 Extension Amendment ). In connection with the 2024 Extension Amendment, shareholders holding 3,229,522 ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata

 portion of the Trust Account. As a result of the 2024 Extension Redemption, an aggregate amount of 36.3 million (approximately 11.24 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. On November 14, 2024, the Company issued the 2024 Extension Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 360,000 to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the 2024 Extension Funds will be deposited into the Trust Account in monthly installments for the benefit of each Public Share that was not redeemed in connection with the 2024 Extension Amendment. The Sponsor has agreed to pay 30,000 per month (or approximately 0.046 per Public Share not redeemed) that the Company decides to take to complete an initial Business Combination for each calendar month until November 18, 2025, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial Business Combination, for up to an aggregate of 360,000. The 2024 Extension Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination, and (b) the date of the liquidation of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, we had investments held in the Trust Account of 43,355,649 (including 3,432,390 of interest income) consisting of money market funds which are invested primarily in U.S. government securities. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 10,598. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our directors and officers may, but are not obligated to (except as described below), loan us Working Capital Loans as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post-business combination entity at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private units. The terms of such Working Capital Loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would be repaid upon consummation of a business combination, without interest. If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares (the Public Shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. We may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. Our officers, directors and our sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we may extend the amount of time to consummate a business combination from November 18, 2024 until November 18, 2025, as extended by the 2024 Extension Amendment. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a business combination by this time. We plan on extending the time to complete an initial business combination by one month from November 18, 2024 to December 18, 2024 by depositing the 30,000 monthly extension payment into the Trust Account on or before November 26, 2024. If a business combination is not consummated by a liquidation deadline there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. We have determined that mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and an extension not be approved by our shareholders, and potential subsequent dissolution and the liquidity issue raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going

 concern for a reasonable period of time which is considered to be one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay our sponsor or its affiliate up to a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, administrative and support services. We began incurring these fees on February 15, 2023 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination and our liquidation. We have engaged I-Bankers, representative of the underwriters in the initial public offering, as an advisor to assist in holding meetings with our shareholders to discuss any potential business combination and the target business attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with our initial business combination and assist with press releases and public filings in connection with the business combination. We will pay I-Bankers a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of our initial business combination in an amount equal to 4.0 , or 2,760,000 in the aggregate, of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering (exclusive of any applicable finders fees which might become payable). We will also pay I-Bankers a cash fee in an amount equal to 1.0 , or 690,000 in the aggregate, of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering if it introduces us to the target business with whom the Company completes its initial business combination. On March 5, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a vendor for legal and consulting services, rendering the previous agreement with the same vendor entered into in 2023 void. The agreement provides that we will pay the vendor 500,000 as follows: (i) 200,000 already paid on May 4, 2023 based on the previous agreement, which was carried forward to the current agreement, (ii) 50,000 by no later than March 15, 2024; (iii) 100,000 upon execution of the business combination agreement, or the merger agreement, as the case may be; and (iv) 150,000 upon submission of the S-4/F-4 proxy to the SEC. Additionally, if the Business Combination closes, we will make a final additional payment of 950,000. If the Business Combination does not close, we shall not be responsible for any further payments. Critical Accounting Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial information. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting estimates require that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the accounting assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates: Investments in Trust Account Assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds which are invested primarily in U.S. government securities. We accounted for the investments as trading securities under FASB ASC Topic 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities , where securities are presented at fair value on the condensed balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in the Trust Account are included in interest earned on investments held in Trust Account in the condensed statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of investments held in the Trust Account amounts to 43,355,649 and 41,440,980, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 Derivative Financial Instruments We evaluate financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the condensed statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified in the condensed balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instruments could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. We accounted for Rights as equity-classified instruments based on an assessment of the Rights specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considered whether the Rights were freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, met the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the Rights met all the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Rights were indexed to the Company s own shares, among other conditions for the equity classification. The fair value of public rights at issuance amounted to 3,305,100. Warrant Instruments We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the instruments are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the instruments are indexed to the ordinary shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of the warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the instruments are outstanding. Upon further review of the warrant agreement, management concluded that the warrants issued pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment. The fair value of public warrants at issuance amounted to 1,104,000, while the fair value of representative warrants at issuance amounted to 12,075. Recent Accounting Standards In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU Topic 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Our management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to: (i) material weaknesses previously identified related to ineffective review of controls over the financial statement preparation process including the valuation of complex financial instruments and recording of accrued expenses, including income taxes and including proper cut off procedures. (ii) material weakness in internal controls related to ineffective review of controls over the financial statement preparation process including the error in recording of excise tax payable and failure to record amounts due from the Sponsor and the 2023 Extension Note payable to Sponsor. (iii) material weakness in internal controls related to the compliance with the terms of the extension payment to extend the time we have to complete an initial business combination. 
 In light of these material weaknesses, we have enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements including making greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to accounting for complex financial transactions, but we can offer no assurance that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice may evolve over time. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings To the knowledge of our management team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. Item 1A. Risk Factors As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, as of the date of this Report, other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in our (i) Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024, September 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively, as filed with the SEC on August 16, 2024, November 14, 2023 and May 18, 2023, respectively, (ii) registration statement for our Initial Public Offering, (iii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024; and (iv) definitive proxy statement, as filed with the SEC on October 31, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Our public shareholders exercise of redemption rights with respect to a large number of Public Shares in the Extension Meeting may affect our ability to complete an initial Business Combination in the most desirable manner that will optimize the capital structure of the combined company, or at all. Over the past two years, the redemption rate of shares held by public shareholders of SPACs at the time of a shareholders meeting that approves an amendment to the charter of the SPAC or the initial Business Combination of the SPAC has been very high, thereby increasing the likelihood that we, too, may be subject to significant redemptions that may affect our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. In connection with the 2024 Extension Meeting, 3,229,522 Public Shares were redeemed at a price per Public Share of approximately 11.24, thereby reducing the number of outstanding Public Shares from 3,881,692 to 652,170, and reducing the total amount held in the Trust Account to approximately 7.3 million (as of November 19, 2024). Due to the high rates of redemptions of Public Shares in connection with shareholder votes to approve extensions or Business Combinations of SPACs, we may need to rely upon significant PIPE or other outside financing to provide cash to our post- Business Combination company. Obtaining financing in connection with initial Business Combinations of SPACs has in recent times been very difficult, with many financings available only on terms that are onerous to the surviving company of the Business Combination. The failure to secure additional financing on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of the Sponsor or our other shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels or on onerous terms. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete a Business Combination in the most desirable manner that will optimize the capital structure of the combined company, or at all. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination, our Public Shareholders may only receive approximately 11.24 per Public Share on the liquidation of our Trust Account, as of November 14, 2024, and our Warrants and Rights will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our Public Shareholders may receive less than 11.24 per share upon the redemption of their Public Shares. For risks related to Youlife and the Business Combination with Youlife, please see the registration statement on Form F-4 to be filed by Pubco once available. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None

 Use of Proceeds For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering and the related private placement, see Part II, Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on April 18, 2023. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and private placement as described in the registration statement for the Initial Public Offering. The specific investments in our Trust Account may change from time to time. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers On November 14, 2024, we held the 2024 Extension Meeting, at which our shareholders approved, as a special resolution, the 2024 Extension Amendment, which extended the date by which we have to consummate a Business Combination from November 18, 2024 on a monthly basis up to twelve (12) times until November 18, 2025, or such earlier date as determined by the Board. In connection with the 2024 Extension Amendment, shareholders holding 3,229,522 ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account. As a result of the 2024 Extension Redemption, we paid cash in the aggregate amount of approximately 36.3 million (approximately 11.24 per share) to such redeeming shareholders. There were no such repurchases of our equity securities by us or an affiliate during the quarterly period covered by the Report. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Trading Arrangements During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) or any or any , as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K. Other Information None.
