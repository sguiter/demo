These convertible promissory notes are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which is measured using the income approach. Under the income approach, the Company used a DCF model in which cash flows anticipated over the term of the notes are discounted to their present value using an expected discount rate. The discount rate used reflected the interest rates offered on loans of similar term and to borrowers of similar credit quality, which are Level 3 inputs. As such, this valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.

 All of our forward-looking statements in this report are made only as of the date of this document and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, including to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC for the most recent information about our forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties related to these statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by this cautionary note. Overview We are North America s leading provider of the cleanest fuel for the transportation market, based on the number of stations operated and the amount of gasoline gallon equivalents GGEs of renewable natural gas RNG and conventional natural gas sold. We calculate one GGE to equal 125,000 British Thermal Units BTUs and, as such, one million BTUs MMBTU equals eight GGEs. Through our sales of RNG, which is derived from biogenic methane produced by the breakdown of organic waste, we help thousands of vehicles, from airport shuttles to city buses to waste and heavy-duty trucks, reduce their amount of climate-harming greenhouse gases GHG from 60 to over 400 based on determinations by the California Air Resources Board CARB ), depending on the source of the RNG, while also reducing criteria pollutants such as Nitrogen Oxides, or NOx. RNG is either delivered as compressed natural gas CNG or liquefied natural gas LNG ). As a clean energy solutions provider, we supply RNG (sourced from third party sources and from our anaerobic digester gas ADG RNG joint venture projects with TotalEnergies S.E. and BP Products North America, Inc. bp (see Note 3)) and conventional natural gas (sourced from third party suppliers), in the form of CNG and LNG, for medium and heavy-duty vehicles; design and build, as well as operate and maintain O M ), public and private vehicle fueling stations in the United States U.S. and Canada; develop and own dairy ADG RNG production facilities; sell and service compressors and other equipment used in RNG production and at fueling stations; transport and sell RNG and conventional natural gas via virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects; sell U.S. federal, state and local government credits (collectively, Environmental Credits we generate by selling RNG as a vehicle fuel, including Renewable Identification Numbers RIN Credits or RINs under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard Phase 2 and credits under the California, Oregon, and Washington Low Carbon Fuel Standards (collectively, LCFS Credits and obtain federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives. At present, we see the best use of RNG as a replacement for fossil-based fuel in the transportation sector. We believe the most attractive market for RNG is U.S. heavy-duty Class 8 trucking and, based on information from the American Trucking Association and our own internal estimates, we believe there are approximately 4.1 million Class 8 heavy-duty trucks operating in the U.S. that use over 40 billion gallons of fuel per year. As of September 30, 2024, we deliver RNG to the transportation market through 583 fueling stations we own, operate or supply in 43 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S., including over 200 stations in California. We also own, operate, or supply 24 fueling stations in Canada as of September 30, 2024. Critically, to generate the valuable Environmental Credits, RNG must be placed in vehicle fuel tanks. We believe our stations and customer relationships allow us to deliver substantially more RNG to vehicle operators than any other participant in the market we calculate that we have access to more fueling stations and vehicle fleets than all our competitors combined. As of September 30, 2024, we served over 1,000 fleet customers operating over 50,000 vehicles on our fuels. Longer term, we plan to expand availability of hydrogen fuel for vehicle fleets. As operators deploy more hydrogen powered vehicles, we can modify our fueling stations to reform our RNG and deliver clean hydrogen to customers. We also believe our RNG can be used to generate clean electricity to power electric vehicles, and we have the capability to add electric vehicle charging at our station sites, although the cost of adding electric vehicle charging capacity may be significant.

 Impact of COVID-19, Inflation, Labor Shortage, Material Availability and Interest Rate The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on the volume of our sales, which we saw bottom in the second quarter of 2020. The subsequent surge in cases driven by the omicron variant negatively affected the demand recovery for our vehicle fuels in the first quarter of 2022. Since that time, we have seen improvement in volumes in all customer markets, and the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not been a significant headwind to our business operations. For more information, see Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this report. In recent periods, we have experienced increases in commodity and supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures. Additionally, effects stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have caused disruptions in labor supply and in supply chains, leading to shortages of certain materials and equipment and higher labor costs that have continued to linger to some extent. The future duration and extent of these pressures and effects are difficult to predict. Although we have partially offset these increased costs through price increases for our products and services, our efforts to manage the current inflationary pressure and to recover inflation-based cost increases from our customers may be hampered by the structure of our contracts as well as the competitive and economic conditions of the markets in which we serve. For more information, see Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this report. As of September 30, 2024, the majority of our debt outstanding represents a long-term loan bearing a fixed rate of interest. Changes in market interest rates do not affect the interest expense incurred from this outstanding long-term debt instrument. However, changes in market interest rates may affect the interest rate and corresponding interest expense on any new issuance of short-term and long-term debt securities. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Part I, Item 3 of this report for more information. Performance Overview This performance overview discusses matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and our operating results. Sources of Revenue The following table presents our sources of revenue: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Revenue (in millions) 2023 2024 2023 2024 Product revenue (1) : Volume-related (2) Fuel sales (3) (5) 60.0 64.1 220.2 189.7 Change in fair value of derivative instruments (4) (1.4) (1.4) (0.3) 0.3 RIN Credits 6.8 11.1 16.7 29.4 LCFS Credits 2.8 1.9 7.5 6.0 AFTC (6) 5.4 6.4 15.0 17.8 Total volume-related product revenue 73.6 82.1 259.1 243.2 Station construction sales 7.7 7.8 17.6 19.1 Total product revenue 81.3 89.9 276.7 262.3 Service revenue (7) : Volume-related, O M services 13.7 14.4 39.6 42.5 Other services 0.6 0.6 2.0 1.7 Total service revenue 14.3 15.0 41.6 44.2 Total revenue 95.6 104.9 318.3 306.5

Table of Contents 
 (2) Our volume-related product revenue primarily consists of sales of RNG and conventional natural gas, in the form of CNG and LNG, and sales of RINs and LCFS Credits in addition to changes in fair value of our derivative instruments. More information about our GGEs of fuel sold in the periods is included below under Key Operating Data, and more information about our derivative instruments, which consist of commodity swap and customer fueling contracts, is included in Note 6. (3) Includes 16.8 million and 44.5 million of non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges related to the Amazon Warrant (as defined in Note 14) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Includes 15.8 million and 42.7 million of non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges related to the Amazon Warrant (as defined in Note 14) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. (4) The change in fair value of unsettled derivative instruments is related to the Company s commodity swap and customer fueling contracts. The amounts are classified as revenue because the Company s commodity swap contracts are used to economically offset the risk associated with the diesel-to-natural gas price spread resulting from customer fueling contracts under the Company s truck financing program. 
 (5) Includes net settlement of the Company s commodity swap derivative instruments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net settlement payments recognized in fuel revenue were 1.9 million and 2.9 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net settlement payments recognized in fuel revenue were 0.0 million and 2.4 million, respectively. (6) Represents the federal alternative fuel excise tax credit AFTC ). AFTC is available for vehicle fuel sales made through December 31, 2024. (7) Our service revenue primarily represents sales from performance of O M services. More information about our GGEs serviced in the periods relating to O M services is included below under Key Operating Data. Additionally, a discussion of service revenue is included below under Results of Operations. 
 Key Operating Data In evaluating our operating performance, we focus primarily on: (1) the amount of total fuel volume we sell to our customers with particular focus on RNG volume as a subset of total fuel volume, (2) O M services volume dispensed at facilities we do not own but where we provide O M services on a per-gallon or fixed fee basis, (3) our station construction cost of sales, and (4) net income (loss) attributable to us. The following tables present our key operating data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Certain gallons are included in both fuel and service volumes when the Company sells fuel (product revenue) to a customer and provides maintenance services (service revenue) to the same customer.

 2024 Key Developments Joint Development Agreement with Maas Energy Works, LLC. In May 2024, we entered into a joint development agreement (the Maas JDA with Maas Energy Works, LLC Maas that granted us exclusive rights to acquire, fund and participate in the development of certain ADG RNG production projects at dairy farms. Pursuant to the Maas JDA, we have the option to exercise our exclusive development rights with respect to these projects subject to our due diligence. We will record all the associated income/loss in earnings until a certain rate of return is achieved and then receive 49 of the income/loss in earnings with Maas receiving 51 . We contemplate investing up to 132.0 million of equity capital in production projects in connection with the Maas joint development. RNG produced from the ADG RNG project(s) will be available to us for sale as vehicle fuel. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has invested 4.1 million to the Project LLC. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Project LLC issued a Capital Call in the amount of 29.6 million, which was contributed by the Company in October 2024. East Valley Dairy Farm Bankruptcy . In April 2024, the dairy farm partner to an ADG RNG production project located in East Valley, Idaho that is currently under construction by the 50-50 joint venture between us and BP Products North America Inc. (the bpJV filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Idaho (the Bankruptcy Court ). The bpJV is party to contracts with the dairy farm partner to lease land and to receive manure feedstock for the ADG RNG production facility currently in construction. The Company is gathering facts, closely monitoring the bankruptcy proceedings, and assessing possible future developments and alternatives. In September 2024, the dairy farm partner filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan of reorganization, which proposes to accept and perform under the contracts with the bpJV but the plan has not yet been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. At present, substantial uncertainty exists and a wide range of potential outcomes are possible, including taking a loss of a substantial part of our investment due to the outcome of the proceedings. In light of this situation, the bpJV has taken steps to vigorously protect its interests in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings. South Fork Dairy Farm Project. On April 10, 2023, an accident resulted in a fire at the South Fork Dairy farm in Dimmitt, Texas, the location of one of our consolidated ADG RNG projects under development. The fire killed the dairy cows and burned down the milking facilities. Our partner, South Fork Dairy, is rebuilding the dairy farm and replenishing the dairy cattle. At the time of the incident, we had not commenced onsite construction activities. Rebuilding efforts were initiated in late 2023. Since then, we have begun to prepare for the construction of the ADG RNG project. In July 2024, the Company broke ground on construction of the RNG production facility at South Fork Farm Dairy. The construction of the digesters and processing plant is expected to be completed in 2025 at a cost of approximately 85 million, which will be home to a 16,000-cow herd with an anticipated 2.6 million GGEs of RNG to be produced annually. Business Risks and Uncertainties and Other Trends Our business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties. For more information, see Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of this report. In addition, our performance in any period may be affected by various trends in our business and our industry, including certain seasonality trends. See the description of the key trends in our past performance and anticipated future trends included in the MD A contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. Except as set forth below, and in Impact of COVID-19, Inflation, Labor Shortage, Material Availability and Interest Rate above, there have been no material changes to such trends as described in the MD A contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. The market for our vehicle fuels is a relatively new and developing market, and has experienced slow, volatile or unpredictable growth in many sectors. For example, to date, adoption and deployment of natural gas vehicles, both in 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 general and in certain of our key customer markets, including heavy-duty trucking, have been slower than we anticipated. Slower growth may occur due to unfavorable macroeconomic events such as inflationary pressures, lingering or reoccurring pandemic effects, supply chain challenges, government regulations related to other alternative fuels or products, or other events. Market prices for RINs and LCFS Credits can be volatile and unpredictable, and the prices for such credits can be subject to significant fluctuations. The value of RINs and LCFS Credits (derived from market prices) can materially affect our revenue. Prices have fluctuated significantly during 2021, 2022 and 2023 and will likely continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and unpredictable. If a decline of our market capitalization were sustained, we may need to perform, and have in the past performed, goodwill impairment tests more frequently and it is possible that our goodwill could become impaired, which could result in material non-cash charges and adversely affect our results of operations. Debt Compliance Certain of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, which are discussed in Note 12, have financial and non-financial covenants with which we must comply. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. Risk Management Activities Our risk management activities are discussed in the MD A contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to these activities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the appropriate application of accounting policies, some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected. Our critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are discussed in the MD A contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. Except for certain updates relating to our goodwill impairment assessment, which are described below, there have been no other material changes to our critical accounting policies as described in the MD A contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs incurred over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess our goodwill using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including, among other considerations, the identification of reporting unit(s), the assessment of qualitative factors, and the estimation of fair value of a reporting unit in the quantitative approach. We determined that we are a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment test. We perform the impairment test annually on October 1 st , or more frequently if facts or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. The qualitative goodwill assessment includes the potential effect on a reporting unit s fair value of certain events and circumstances, including its enterprise value, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity-specific events. If it is determined, based upon the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 performed. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit and directly perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test estimates the reporting unit's fair value based on its market value of invested capital plus a market participant acquisition premium derived from recent merger and acquisition transactions in comparable industry and market sectors as those in which the Company operates. The estimates, including the estimation methodology, used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit may change based on results of operations, macroeconomic conditions, stock price fluctuations or other factors. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for the reporting unit. Due to a decline in the market price of our common stock subsequent to December 31, 2023, we performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 for our single reporting unit as described above, which resulted in a fair value, based on its market value of invested capital plus a market participant acquisition premium, that exceeded carrying value by 17 or 179.8 million. Although, subsequent to September 30, 2024, there have been further declines in the market price of our common stock and in our market capitalization, we have not deemed that such declines will be sustained nor have we identified other events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit to below its carrying value on a sustained basis. As such, we believe the reporting unit s goodwill as of September 30, 2024 was not impaired. It is possible that our goodwill could become impaired if we determine in a subsequent period that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount on a sustained basis, which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that could result in an impairment review include, among others, a significant decrease in the operating performance of a long-lived asset or asset group or the decision to close a fueling station. Impairment testing involves a comparison of the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment, if any, to be recognized. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. The fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. The estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including, among others, future results, demand and economic conditions, many of which can be difficult to predict. Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 for a description of recently adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting standards pending adoption.

 Results of Operations The table below presents, for each period indicated, each line item of our statements of operations data as a percentage of our total revenue for the period. Additionally, the narrative that follows provides a comparative discussion of certain of these line items between the periods indicated. Historical results are not indicative of the results to be expected in the current period or any future period. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 2024 Statements of Operations Data: Revenue: Product revenue 85.0 85.7 Service revenue 15.0 14.3 Total revenue 100.0 100.0 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below): Product cost of sales 68.5 60.9 Service cost of sales 9.4 8.9 Selling, general and administrative 30.5 27.5 Depreciation and amortization 14.0 10.8 Total operating expenses 122.4 108.1 Operating loss (22.4) (8.1) Interest expense (4.1) (8.0) Interest income 2.7 3.4 Other income (expense), net Loss from equity method investments (3.5) (4.8) Loss before income taxes (27.3) (17.5) Income tax (expense) benefit Net loss (27.3) (17.5) Loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 0.1 0.1 Net loss attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (27.2) (17.4) Product revenue . Product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 8.6 million to 89.9 million, representing 85.7 of total revenue, compared to 81.3 million, representing 85.0 of total revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to (1) increased bulk fuel sales into the marine sector, increased volumes of vehicle fueling at our stations, and a decrease of 1.0 million in non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges relating to the Amazon Warrant Asset that was fully amortized by the end of 2023, resulting in a 4.1 million net increase in fuel sales from the prior year period. In addition, (2) an increase in RIN revenue of 4.3 million principally attributable to higher share of RIN values in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to that in the same period of 2023, (3) an increase in AFTC revenue of 1.0 million in part due to higher bulk fuel sales into the marine sector, and (4) an increase in station construction sales of 0.1 million due to increased construction activities , all contributed to the increase in product revenue in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in product revenue between periods was partially offset by (1) a decrease in LCFS revenue of 0.9 million primarily due to lower LCFS credit prices in the third quarter of 2024. Service revenue . Service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.7 million to 15.0 million, representing 14.3 of total revenue, compared to 14.3 million, representing 15.0 of total revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional work performed at private stations. Product cost of sales . Product cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.5 million to 63.9 million, representing 60.9 of total revenue, from 65.4 million, representing 68.5 of total revenue, in 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower underlying natural gas commodity costs, partially offset by a 0.8 million increase in station construction costs. Service cost of sales . Service cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.3 million to 9.3 million, representing 8.9 of total revenue, compared with 9.0 million or 9.4 of total revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the additional work performed at private stations. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 0.2 million to 28.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 29.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 3.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to vesting of equity awards granted in prior years, partially offset by a 3.0 million increase in general business, selling and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased by 2.0 million to 11.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 13.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to more assets being fully depreciated partially offset by higher amount of depreciable assets. Interest expense. Interest expense increased by 4.5 million to 8.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (1) a 3.7 increase due to higher outstanding indebtedness and (2) a 0.8 increase due to higher amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Interest income. Interest income increased by 1.0 million to 3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher average interest rates of the Company s short-term investments and loan receivables. Loss from equity method investments. Loss from equity method investments increased by 1.7 million to 5.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the operating results of SAFE CEC S.r.l., Rimere, and our joint venture(s) with TotalEnergies and bp. Income tax (expense) benefit. Income tax benefit was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recognized an income tax expense of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Income tax expense and/or benefit is primarily related to deferred taxes associated with goodwill and the Company s expected state tax expense. Loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we recorded a gain of 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, for the noncontrolling interest in the net loss of NG Advantage, LLC NG Advantage ). The noncontrolling interest in NG Advantage represents a 6.7 minority interest that was held by third parties during both the 2023 and 2024 periods.

The decrease was primarily due to lower average prices on fuel sold driven by a decrease in the prices of natural gas, partially offset by an increase in total GGEs of fuel sold and a decrease of 1.8 million in non-cash stock-based sales incentive contra-revenue charges relating to the Amazon Warrant due to zero amortization relating to customer incentive asset in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 partially offset by higher customer fuel purchases, resulting in a 30.5 million net decrease in fuel sales from the prior year period. In addition, a decrease in LCFS revenue of 1.5 million primarily resulting from lower average LCFS prices also contributed to the decrease in product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in product revenue between periods was partially offset by (1) an increase in RIN revenue of 12.7 million principally attributable to higher share and average RIN prices, (2) an increase in AFTC revenue of 2.8 million primarily due to higher fuel volumes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year, (3) a change in fair value of our commodity swap and customer contracts entered into in connection with our truck financing program, as we recognized an unrealized gain of 0.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 0.3 million in the same period of 2023, and (4) an increase in station construction sales of 1.5 million due to increased construction activities. Service revenue . Service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6 million to 44.2 million, representing 14.4 of total revenue, compared to 41.6 million, representing 13.1 of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in GGEs serviced. Product cost of sales . Product cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 56.5 million to 184.2 million, representing 60.1 of total revenue, from 240.7 million, representing 75.6 of total revenue, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower average prices of natural gas in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to those in the same period in the prior year. In 2023, there was a significant rise in the cost of natural gas in California during January and February. The effects of lower natural gas 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 prices in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were partially offset by an increase in GGEs of fuel sold and a 2.4 million increase in station construction costs. Service cost of sales . Service cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.3 million to 28.5 million, representing 9.3 of total revenue, compared with 25.2 million or 7.9 of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in GGEs serviced. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 3.9 million to 83.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 87.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 9.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to vesting of equity awards granted in prior years, partially offset by a 6.0 million increase in general business, selling and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased by 1.2 million to 33.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 35.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to more assets being fully depreciated partially offset by higher amount of depreciable assets. Interest expense. Interest expense increased by 11.4 million to 24.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 12.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to (1) a 8.9 increase due to higher outstanding indebtedness and (2) a 2.5 increase due to higher amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Interest income. Interest income increased by 2.8 million to 10.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 8.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher average interest rates of the Company s short-term investments and loan receivables. Loss from equity method investments. Loss from equity method investments increased by 9.1 million to 16.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 7.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the operating results of SAFE CEC S.r.l., Rimere, and our joint venture(s) with TotalEnergies and bp. Income tax (expense) benefit. Income tax benefit was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recognized an income tax expense of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Income tax expense and/or benefit is primarily related to deferred taxes associated with goodwill and the Company s expected state tax expense. Loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we recorded a gain of 0.5 million and 0.5 million, respectively, for the noncontrolling interest in the net loss of NG Advantage. The noncontrolling interest in NG Advantage represents a 6.7 minority interest that was held by third parties during both the 2023 and 2024 periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through operating cash flows, the sale or maturity of investments or the acquisition of additional funds through capital management. Our financial position and liquidity are, and will continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors, including the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the principal and interest we are obligated to pay on our indebtedness; the amount and timing of any capital calls related to the joint venture(s) with TotalEnergies and/or bp, or any other joint venture we may enter into in the future; the amount and timing of any additional debt or equity financing we may pursue; our capital expenditure requirements; any merger, divestiture or acquisition activity; and our ability to generate cash flows from our operations. We expect cash provided by our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our operating results and the factors that affect these results, including the amount and timing of our vehicle fuel sales, station construction sales, sales of RINs and LCFS Credits and recognition of government credits, grants and incentives, if any; fluctuations in commodity, station construction and labor costs; supply chain issues and unfavorable macroeconomic events, including inflationary 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 pressures; environmental credit prices; variations in the fair value of certain of our derivative instruments that are recorded in revenue; and the amount and timing of our billing, collections and liability payments. Cash Flows Operating Activities . Cash provided by operating activities was 42.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 0.8 million in the comparable 2023 period. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher contributions relating to the procurement and sales of natural gas in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, changes in working capital resulting from the timing of cash receipts, accruals, billings and payments of cash contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities was 30.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities of 96.7 million in the comparable 2023 period. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a 41.3 million increase in net maturities of short-term investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, a 22.7 million net decrease in capital expenditures on property and equipment and on RNG production projects, and a 2.2 million decrease in investments in other entities. Financing Activities . Cash used in financing activities was 0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in financing activities of 3.0 million in the comparable 2023 period. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to higher cash receipts of incentive payments relating to our Adopt-a-Port program and lower cash payments of debt issuance fees relating to our debt instruments, partially offset by lower cash receipts from exercise of stock options. Capital Expenditures, Indebtedness and Other Uses of Cash We require cash to fund our capital expenditures, operating expenses and working capital and other requirements, including costs associated with fuel sales; outlays for the design and construction of new fueling stations; additions or other modifications to existing fueling stations; RNG production facilities; debt repayments and repurchases; repurchases of common stock; purchases of heavy-duty trucks that use our fuels; additions or modifications of LNG production facilities; supporting our operations, including maintenance and improvements of our infrastructure; supporting our sales and marketing activities, including support of legislative and regulatory initiatives; financing vehicles for our customers; any investments in other entities; any mergers or acquisitions, including acquisitions to expand our RNG production capacity; pursuing market expansion as opportunities arise, including geographically and to new customer markets; and to fund other activities or pursuits and for other general corporate purposes. Our business plan calls for approximately 60.0 million in capital expenditures in 2024. These capital expenditures primarily relate to the construction of fueling stations, IT software and equipment and LNG plant costs, and we expect to fund these expenditures primarily through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. Further, in 2024, we anticipate deploying up to approximately 65.0 million to develop ADG RNG production facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we have invested 284.9 million in the development of ADG RNG production facilities, which includes 242.2 million contributed to our joint ventures. We had total indebtedness, consisting of our debt and finance leases, of approximately 303.3 million in principal amount as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately 0.9 million, 1.1 million, 0.7 million, 0.5 million, 0.1 million and 300.0 million are expected to become due in 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and thereafter, respectively. Based on our outstanding indebtedness and applicable interest rates as of September 30, 2024, we expect our total interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness to be approximately 29.3 million in 2024, 22.0 million of which had been paid when due as of September 30, 2024. We plan to and believe we are able to make all expected principal and interest payments in the next 12 months. We also have indebtedness, including the amount representing interest, from our operating leases of approximately 153.3 million as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately 4.0 million, 16.7 million, 16.6 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 million, 16.7 million, 15.8 million and 83.5 million are expected to become due in 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and thereafter, respectively. We intend to make payments under our various debt instruments when due and pursue opportunities for earlier repayment and/or refinancing if and when these opportunities arise. Although we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to repay our debt coming due in the next 12 months, we may elect to suspend, or limit repurchases under, our share repurchase program or pursue alternatives, such as refinancing, or debt or equity offerings, to increase our cash management flexibility. Sources of Cash Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash on hand; cash provided by our operations, including, if available, AFTC and other government credits, grants and incentives; cash provided by financing activities; and sales of assets. As of September 30, 2024, excluding current portion of restricted cash, we had total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 243.5 million, compared to 263.1 million as of December 31, 2023. We expect cash provided by our operating activities to fluctuate depending on our operating results, which can be affected by the factors described above, as well as the other factors described in this MD A and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report. Subject to the following paragraph, we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and anticipated cash provided by our operating and current or future financing activities will satisfy our expected business requirements for at least the 12 months following the date of this report. Subsequent to that period, we may need to raise additional capital to fund any planned or unanticipated capital expenditures, investments, debt repayments, share repurchases or other expenses that we cannot fund through cash on-hand, cash provided by our operations or other sources. Moreover, we may use our cash resources faster than we predict due to unexpected expenditures or higher-than-expected expenses due to unfavorable macroeconomic events, including inflationary pressures or otherwise, in which case we may need to seek capital from alternative sources sooner than we anticipate. The timing and necessity of any future capital raise would depend on various factors, including our rate and volume of, and prices for, natural gas fuel sales and other volume-related activity, new station construction, debt repayments (either before or at maturity) and any potential mergers, acquisitions, investments, divestitures or other strategic relationships we may pursue, as well as the other factors that affect our revenue and expense levels as described in this MD A and elsewhere in this report. If we deploy additional capital to develop ADG RNG production facilities and fueling stations to support contracted RNG fueling volume, we could be required to raise additional capital. We may raise additional capital through one or more sources, including, among others, obtaining equity capital, including through offerings of our common stock or other securities, obtaining new or restructuring existing debt, selling assets, or any combination of these or other potential sources of capital. We may not be able to raise capital when needed, on terms that are favorable to us or our stockholders or at all. Any inability to raise necessary capital may impair our ability to develop and maintain fueling infrastructure, invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions or repay our outstanding indebtedness and may reduce our ability to support and build our business and generate sustained or increased revenue. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had the following off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources: Outstanding surety bonds for construction contracts and general corporate purposes totaling 92.4 million; A loan commitment to an equity method investee; Quarterly fixed-price natural gas purchase contracts with take-or-pay commitments; and One long-term natural gas sale contract with a fixed supply commitment. 

45 

Table of Contents 
 We provide surety bonds primarily for construction contracts in the ordinary course of our business, as a form of guarantee. No liability has been recorded in connection with our surety bonds because, based on historical experience and available information, we do not believe it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements for which we will not be reimbursed. We entered into a note purchase agreement, dated January 8, 2024, with Rimere, an equity method investee, pursuant to which we committed to make available up to 10.0 million in delayed draw loans to support Rimere s working capital requirements (see Note 17). As of September 30, 2024, we have quarterly fixed-price natural gas purchase contracts with take-or-pay commitments extending through March 2025. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we have a fixed supply arrangement with UPS for the supply and sale of 170.0 million GGEs of RNG through March 2026. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to various market risks, including commodity price risks, risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, and risks related to fluctuations in interest rates. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to market risk with respect to our sales of natural gas, which have historically been subject to volatile market conditions. Our exposure to market risk is heightened when we have a fixed-price sales contract with a customer that is not covered by a futures contract, or when we are otherwise unable to pass through natural gas price increases to customers. Natural gas prices and availability are affected by many factors, including, among others, drilling activity, supply, weather conditions, the global trade environment, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic government regulations. Natural gas costs represented 190.6 million of our total cost of sales in 2023 and 89.8 million of our total cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we are exposed to market price risk relating to the diesel-to-natural gas price spread associated with the natural gas fuel supply commitments we make in our fueling agreements with fleet operators who participate in the Company s truck financing program. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to our Canadian operations that had certain outstanding accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in Canadian dollar, which were not hedged. We performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to our monetary transactions denominated in a foreign currency. If the exchange rates on these assets and liabilities were to fluctuate by 10 from the rates as of September 30, 2024, we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the net assets to be approximately 0.1 million. Interest Rate Risk As of September 30, 2024, we had no debt that bears a variable rate of interest. Certain London Inter-bank Offered Rate LIBOR tenors were discontinued after 2021 with other LIBOR tenors discontinued after June 2023. We intend to monitor the developments with respect to the discontinuance of LIBOR and work with our lenders to minimize the effect of such a discontinuance on our financial condition and results of operations. To date, the effect of the discontinuance of LIBOR on us and on our debt instruments has not been material. However, if our lenders have increased costs due to 

 46 

Table of Contents 
 changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt or fees on our fixed rate debt, which could adversely affect our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive and principal financial officers, respectively), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We regularly review and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, and from time to time we may make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls or increase efficiencies. Such changes may include, among others, implementing new and more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In designing our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of our controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of these inherent limitations, our disclosure and internal controls may not prevent or detect all instances of fraud, misstatements or other control issues. In addition, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure or internal controls to future periods are subject to risks, including, among others, that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including lawsuits, claims, audits, government enforcement actions and related matters. It is not possible to predict when or if these proceedings may arise, nor is it possible to predict the outcome of any proceedings that do arise, including, among other things, the amount or timing of any liabilities we may incur, and any such proceedings could have a material effect on us regardless of outcome. In the opinion of management, however, we are not a party, and our properties are not subject, to any pending legal proceedings that are material to us. Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk of loss. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below and all of the other information included in this report before you make any investment decision regarding our securities. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face, but additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also be or become significant. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Risks Related to Our Business Our success is dependent on the willingness of fleets and other customers to adopt our vehicle fuels, which may not occur in a timely manner, at expected levels or at all. Our success is highly dependent on the adoption by fleets and other customers of our RNG and conventional natural gas vehicle fuels. The market for our vehicle fuels has experienced slow, volatile and unpredictable growth in many sectors. For example, adoption and deployment of our vehicle fuels in heavy-duty trucking has been slower and more limited than we anticipated. Also, other important fleet markets, including airports and public transit, had slower volume and customer growth in recent years that may continue. If the market for our vehicle fuels does not develop at improved rates or levels, or if a market develops but we are not able to capture a significant share of the market or the market subsequently declines, our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results would be harmed. Factors that may influence the adoption of our vehicle fuels, many of which are beyond our control, include, among others: lack of demand for trucks that use our vehicle fuels; adoption or expansion of government policies, programs, funding or incentives, or increased publicity or popular sentiment in favor of vehicles or fuels other than RNG and natural gas, including long-standing support for diesel-powered vehicles, changes to emissions requirements applicable to vehicles and fleets powered by diesel, RNG, natural gas, or other vehicle fuels and/or growing support for electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles; limitations on the capabilities of utilities to provide services to meet our requirements. For example, natural gas utilities may be unable to expand piping or provide services for new expansions, and electric utilities may lack the capacity to provide service for our projects; perceptions about the benefits of our vehicle fuels relative to diesel and other alternative vehicle fuels, including with respect to factors such as supply, cost savings, environmental benefits and safety; increases, decreases or volatility in the supply, demand, use and prices of crude oil, diesel, RNG, natural gas and other vehicle fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen, renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol; inertia among fleets and fleet vehicle operators, who may be unable or unwilling to prioritize converting a fleet to our vehicle fuels over an operator s other general business concerns, particularly if the operator is not sufficiently incentivized by emissions regulations or other requirements or lacks demand for the conversion from its customers, drivers, or other stakeholders; vehicle cost, fuel efficiency, availability, quality, safety, convenience (to fuel and service), design, performance and residual value, as well as operator perception with respect to these factors, generally and in our key customer markets and relative to comparable vehicles powered by other fuels; the development, production, cost, availability, performance, sales and marketing and reputation of engines that are well-suited for the vehicles used in our key customer markets, including heavy-duty trucks and other fleets; increasing competition in the market for vehicle fuels generally, and the nature and effect of competitive developments in this market, including improvements in or perceived advantages of other vehicle fuels and engines powered by these fuels; the impact of federal or state laws, orders or regulations mandating new or additional limits on GHG emissions, tailpipe emissions or internal combustion engines, 

 48 

Table of Contents 
 including the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, the September 2020 Executive Order, the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation and the 2021 Executive Order (each as defined below); the availability and effect of environmental, tax or other government regulations, programs or incentives that promote our products or other alternatives as a vehicle fuel, including certain programs under which we generate credits by selling RNG as a vehicle fuel, as well as the market prices for such credits; and emissions and other environmental regulations and pressures on producing, transporting, and dispensing our fuels. In addition, as our customers and partners react to economic conditions and the potential for a global recession, they may reduce spending and take additional precautionary measures to limit or delay expenditures and preserve capital and liquidity. Reductions in spending, delays in purchasing decisions, lack of renewals, inability to attract new customers, uncertainty about business continuity as well as pressure for extended billing terms or pricing discounts, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. We are dependent on the production of vehicles and engines in our key customer and geographic markets by manufacturers, over which we have no control. Vehicle and engine manufacturers control the development, production, quality assurance, cost and sales and marketing of their products, which shapes the performance, availability and reputation of these products in the marketplace. We are dependent on these manufacturers to succeed in our target markets, and we have no influence or control over their activities. A small number of manufacturers, chiefly Cummins, produce engines that use our vehicle fuels. The number of manufacturers making vehicles that use our fuels is limited as well. These manufacturers may decide not to expand or maintain, or may decide to discontinue or curtail, their engine or vehicle product lines for a variety of reasons, including as a result of the adoption of government policies or programs such as the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, the September 2020 Executive Order and the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation. The limited production of engines and vehicles that use our fuels increases their cost and limits availability, which restricts large-scale adoption, and may reduce resale value, which may contribute to operator reluctance to convert their fleets to vehicles that use our fuels. In addition, some operators have communicated to us that earlier models of heavy-duty truck engines using our fuels have a reputation for unsatisfactory performance, and that this reputation or their first-hand experiences of such performance may be a factor in operator decisions regarding whether to convert their fleets to vehicles that use our fuels. If manufactures of vehicles and engines that use our fuels develop unsatisfactory vehicles or engines, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our RNG business may not be successful. Our RNG business consists of procuring RNG from projects we plan to develop and own or from projects owned by third-party producers and reselling this RNG through our fueling infrastructure. The success of our RNG business depends on our ability to secure, on acceptable terms, a sufficient supply of RNG; sell this RNG in adequate volumes and at prices that are attractive to customers and produce acceptable margins for us; and sell Environmental Credits we may generate under applicable federal or state programs from our sale of RNG as a vehicle fuel at favorable prices as well as our ability to appropriately balance supply we take with demand from customers. Our ability to maintain an adequate supply of RNG is subject to risks affecting RNG production, including unpredictable production levels or other difficulties due to, among others, problems with equipment, severe weather, droughts, financial condition or bankruptcy or insolvency of the applicable ADG and LFG source owner, health crises and pandemics, construction delays, technical difficulties, high operating costs, limited availability, unfavorable composition of collected feedstock gas, and plant shutdowns caused by upgrades, expansion, required maintenance, or other operational issues. The agriculture industry generally, and the dairy industry in particular, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may lead to financial and other challenges impacting RNG production levels and potentially our future investments in RNG projects. For example, various entities with whom we have contracted for our project in East Valley, Idaho filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2024, which could have a material adverse impact on our RNG production at and investment in that project. Our ability to balance supply with demand from customers is subject to risk where we are committed to acquire RNG produced by third-party producers that could exceed the level of demand of our customers. If we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of RNG or are oversupplied with RNG versus customer demand, our business, financial condition, and performance could be negatively affected. In addition, increasing demand for RNG will result in more 

 49 

Table of Contents 
 robust competition for supplies of RNG, including from other vehicle fuel providers, gas utilities and other users and providers. If we or any of our RNG suppliers experience these or other difficulties in RNG production processes, or if competition for RNG development projects and supply increases, then our supply of RNG and our ability to resell it as a vehicle fuel could be jeopardized. Our ability to generate revenue from our sale of RNG or our generation and sale of Environmental Credits depends on many factors, including the markets for RNG as a vehicle fuel and for Environmental Credits. The markets for Environmental Credits have been volatile and unpredictable in recent periods, and the prices for these credits are subject to fluctuations. Additionally, the value of Environmental Credits, and consequently the revenue levels we may receive from our sale of these credits, may be adversely affected by changes to the federal and state programs under which these credits are generated and sold, prices for and use of oil, diesel or gasoline, the inclusion of additional qualifying fuels in the programs, increased production and use of other fuels in the programs, or other conditions. Our ability to generate revenue from sales of Environmental Credits depends on our strict compliance with these federal and state programs, which are complex and can involve a significant degree of judgment. If the agencies that administer and enforce these programs disagree with our judgments, otherwise determine we are not in compliance, conduct reviews of our activities or make changes to the programs, then our ability to generate or sell these credits could be restricted, permanently limited, or lost entirely, and we could also be subject to fines or other sanctions. Any of these outcomes could force us to purchase credits in the open market to cover any credits we have contracted to sell, retire credits we may have generated but not yet sold, reduce or eliminate a significant revenue stream, or incur substantial additional and unplanned expenses. Any permanent or temporary discontinuation or suspension of federal and state programs that provide credits, grants and incentives, such as the AFTC, would also adversely impact our revenue. Moreover, in the absence of programs that allow us to generate and sell Environmental Credits or other federal and state programs that support the RNG vehicle fuel market, or if our customers are not willing to pay a premium for RNG, we may be unable to operate our RNG business profitably or at all. Our commercial success depends on our ability and the ability of our third-party supply sources to successfully develop and operate projects and produce expected volumes of RNG. Our specific focus on RNG exposes us to risks related to the supply of and demand for RNG and Environmental Credits, the cost of capital expenditures, government regulation, and economic conditions, among other factors. As an RNG supplier we may also be negatively affected by lower RNG production resulting from lack of feedstock, mechanical breakdowns, faulty technology, competitive markets, or changes to the laws and regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy sources. In addition, other factors related to the development and operation of renewable energy projects could adversely affect our business, including: (i) changes in pipeline gas quality standards or other regulatory changes that may limit our ability to transport RNG on pipelines for delivery to vehicles or increase the costs of processing RNG to allow for such deliveries; (ii) construction risks, including the risk of delay, that may arise because of inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, labor disruptions, disputes, or increases in costs for or shortages of equipment and construction materials; (iii) operating risks; (iv) weather conditions; (v) financial condition of the applicable source owner, including obstacles to their ability to adequately fund their operations or pay vendors and creditors; (vi) health of the applicable dairy herd; (vii) consolidation in the dairy industry; (viii) budget overruns; (ix) possible liabilities because of unforeseen environmental, construction, technological or other complications; (x) failures or delays in obtaining desired or necessary rights, including leases and feedstock agreements; (xi) diseases and health crises; and (xii) failures or delays in obtaining and keeping in good standing permits, authorizations and consents from local city, county, state and U.S. federal governments as well as local and U.S. federal governmental organizations. Any of these factors could prevent completion or operation of projects, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Acquisition, financing, construction, and development of projects by us or our partners that own projects and divestitures, investments or other strategic relationships, may not commence on anticipated timelines or at all, may not meet expectations, and may otherwise harm our business. Our strategy is to continue to expand, including through the acquisition of additional projects and by signing additional supply agreements with third-party project owners. From time to time, we and our partners enter into nonbinding 

 50 

Table of Contents 
 letters of intent for projects. Until the negotiations are final, however, and the parties have executed definitive documentation, we or our partners may not be able to consummate any development or acquisition transactions, or any other similar arrangements, on the terms set forth in the applicable letter of intent or at all. The acquisition, financing, construction and development of projects involves numerous risks, including: the ability to obtain financing for a project on acceptable terms or at all; difficulties in identifying, obtaining, and permitting suitable sites for new projects; failure to obtain all necessary rights to land access and use; inaccuracy of assumptions with respect to the cost and schedule for completing construction; inaccuracy of assumptions with respect to the biogas potential, including quality, volume, and asset life; delays in deliveries or increases in the price of equipment; permitting and other regulatory issues, license revocation and changes in legal requirements; increases in the cost of labor, labor disputes and work stoppages; potential business, financial stress or bankruptcy of partners or applicable source owners; failure to receive quality and timely performance of third-party or utility services; unforeseen engineering and environmental problems; cost overruns; accidents involving personal injury or the loss of life; and weather conditions, catastrophic events, including fires, explosions, earthquakes, droughts and acts of terrorism, and other force majeure events. Additionally, we may acquire or invest in other companies or businesses or pursue other strategic transactions or relationships, such as joint ventures, collaborations, divestitures, or other similar arrangements. These strategic transactions and relationships and any others we may pursue in the future involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, performance and liquidity, including, among others, the following: (i) difficulties integrating the operations, personnel, contracts, service providers and technologies of an acquired company or partner; (ii) diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or other opportunities; (iii) failure to realize the anticipated synergies or other benefits of a transaction or relationship; (iv) risks of entering new customer or geographic markets in which we may have limited or no experience; (v) potential loss of our or an acquired company s or partner s key employees, customers, vendors or assets in the event of an acquisition or investment; and (vi) incurrence of substantial costs or debt or equity dilution to fund an acquisition, investment or other transaction or relationship, as well as possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to any businesses we partner with, invest in or acquire. Further, our partners, including TotalEnergies, bp and Chevron, may reallocate their resources from RNG to other renewable or low carbon vehicle fuels. Any such action would have a material adverse effect on our plans, results of operations and financial condition. To secure ADG RNG from new projects we develop, we typically face a long and variable development cycle that requires significant resource commitments and a long lead time before we realize revenue. The development, design and construction process for ADG RNG projects generally lasts between 12 to 24 months on average. Prior to entering into a letter of intent with respect to an ADG RNG project, we typically conduct a preliminary assessment of whether the site is commercially viable based on our expected return on investment, investment payback period, and other operating metrics, as well as whether the necessary permits to develop a project on that site are available. After entering into a project letter of intent, we perform a more detailed review of the site s facilities, including a life-cycle assessment, which serves as the basis for the final specifications of the project. Finally, we negotiate and execute contracts with the site owner and other parties. This extended development process requires the dedication of significant time and resources from our personnel, with no certainty of success or recovery of our expenses. Further, upon commencement of operations, it takes about 15-18 months for the project to ramp up to expected production level, receive necessary registrations and approvals from the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and CARB, and begin generating revenue. All these factors, and in particular, expenditures on development of projects that will not generate significant revenue in the near term, can contribute to fluctuations in our financial performance and increase the likelihood that our operating results in a particular period will fall below investor expectations. Livestock waste and dairy farm projects are dependent on LCFS credits and RINS. Livestock waste and dairy farm projects are heavily dependent on the LCFS credits and, to a lesser extent, RINs for commercial viability. If CARB reduces the CI score that it applies to waste conversion projects, such as dairy digesters, the number of LCFS credits for RNG generated at livestock waste and dairy farm projects will decline. Additionally, revenue from LCFS credits also depends on the price per LCFS credit. LCFS credit prices are driven by various market forces, including the supply of and demand for LCFS credits, which depends on the demand for traditional and other renewable fuels and mandated CI targets, which determine the number of LCFS credits required to offset LCFS deficits.

Table of Contents 
 Fluctuations in the price of LCFS credits or the number of LCFS credits assigned will significantly affect the success of our livestock waste and dairy farm projects. RINs and LCFS Credit prices have fluctuated in recent years and will likely continue to be volatile. A significant decline in the value of LCFS credits could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future. We have incurred pre-tax losses in the past, may incur losses in the future, and may never sustain profitability, any of which would adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition and may cause the price of our common stock to fall. Furthermore, historical losses may not be indicative of future losses, and our future losses may be greater than our past losses. In addition, to try to achieve or sustain profitability, we may choose or be forced to take actions that result in material costs or material asset or goodwill impairments. For instance, we have recorded significant charges in connection with our closure of certain fueling stations, our determination that certain assets were impaired because of the foregoing, and other actions. We review our assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, and we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, in each case in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and as described in the financial statements and related notes included in this report. For example, due to a decline in the market price of our common stock, we determined that an indicator of potential goodwill impairment existed as of September 30, 2024; as such, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test of our single reporting unit. In addition, changes to the use of our assets, divestitures, changes to the structure of our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our operations, inability to effectively integrate any acquired businesses, further market capitalization declines, or other similar actions or conditions could result in additional asset impairment or goodwill impairment charges or other adverse consequences, any of which could have material negative effects on our financial condition, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Our plans for hydrogen and electric vehicle stations will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations. As operators deploy hydrogen powered vehicles, we plan to modify our fueling stations to reform our RNG, build additional hydrogen stations, and deliver clean hydrogen. Further, we have the capability to add electric charging at our sites, and we believe our RNG can be used to generate clean electricity to power vehicles. Our plans will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our vehicle fuels. We have experience constructing hydrogen fueling stations, but such facilities cost significantly more than traditional RNG vehicle fueling stations. In addition, we have not yet added electric charging capability to any of our stations, and the cost of such capability may be significant. We will need to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, including obtaining any required permits and land use rights, which could take considerable time and expense and is subject to the risk that government support in certain areas may be discontinued. If we are unable to modify our stations to provide hydrogen or add electric charging to our stations, or if we experience delays in doing so, our stations may be unable to meet our customer demand, which may negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, even if we are able to successfully modify our stations to provide hydrogen or electric charging stations, we will be dependent on the manufacturers of hydrogen and electric vehicles to succeed in our target markets, and we will have no influence over their activities. See the risks discussed under We are dependent on the production of vehicles and engines in our key customer and geographic markets by original equipment manufacturers, over which we have no control , above and elsewhere in these risk factors. Increases, decreases and general volatility in oil, diesel, renewable diesel, natural gas, RNG and Environmental Credit prices could adversely affect our business. The prices of RNG, natural gas, crude oil, diesel, renewable diesel, and Environmental Credits can be volatile, and this volatility may continue to increase. Factors that may cause volatility in the prices of RNG, natural gas, crude oil, diesel, renewable diesel, and Environmental Credits include, among others, changes in supply and availability of crude oil, RNG and other renewable transportation fuels, and natural gas, government regulations, inventory levels, customer demand, price and availability of alternatives, weather conditions, negative publicity about crude oil or natural gas drilling, 

 52 

Table of Contents 
 production or transportation techniques and methods, worldwide economic, military, health and political conditions, transportation costs and the price of foreign imports. If the prices of crude oil and diesel are low or decline, or if the price of RNG or natural gas increases without corresponding increases in the prices of crude oil and diesel or Environmental Credits, we may not be able to offer our customers an attractive price for our vehicle fuels, market adoption of our vehicle fuels could be slowed or limited and/or we may be forced to reduce the prices at which we sell our vehicle fuels in order to try to attract new customers or prevent the loss of demand from existing customers. Natural gas and crude oil prices are expected to remain volatile for the near future because of market uncertainties over supply and demand, including due to the state of the world economy, geopolitical conditions, military conflicts such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, energy infrastructure and other factors. Fluctuations in natural gas prices affect the cost to us of the natural gas commodity. High natural gas prices adversely affect our operating margins when we cannot pass the increased costs through to our customers. Conversely, lower natural gas prices reduce our revenue when the commodity cost is passed through to our customers. Pricing conditions may also exacerbate the cost differential between vehicles that use our fuels and diesel-powered vehicles, which may lead operators to delay or refrain from purchasing or converting to our vehicle fuels. Generally, vehicles that use our fuels cost more initially than diesel-powered vehicles because the components needed for a vehicle to use our fuels add to the vehicle s base cost. Operators then seek to recover the additional base cost over time through a lower cost to use our fuels. Operators may, however, perceive an inability to timely recover these additional initial costs if our vehicle fuels are not available at prices sufficiently lower than diesel. Such an outcome could decrease our potential customer base and harm our business prospects. We face increasing competition from competitors, many of which have far greater resources, customer bases and brand awareness than we have, and we may not be able to compete effectively with these businesses. The market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. The biggest competition for our products is diesel because most vehicles in our key markets are powered by these fuels. We also compete with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel, and ethanol, as well as producers and fuelers of alternative vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Additionally, our stations compete directly with other natural gas fueling stations and indirectly with electric vehicle charging stations and fueling stations for other vehicle fuels. Many businesses are in the market for RNG and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuel, including alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, industrial gas companies, private equity groups, commodity traders, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers, gas marketers, utilities and their affiliates and other organizations. If the alternative vehicle fuel market grows, the number and type of participants in this market and their level of capital and other commitments to alternative vehicle fuel programs could increase. Many of our competitors have substantially greater customer bases, brand awareness and financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends; devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products; adopt more aggressive pricing policies; dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in support of their business or product development activities; implement more robust or creative initiatives to advance customer acceptance of their products; or exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that affects the vehicle fuels market. We expect competition to increase in the vehicle fuels market generally. In addition, if the demand for alternative vehicle fuels, including RNG, increases, then we expect competition to also increase. Any such increased competition may reduce our customer base and revenue and may lead to increased pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities. We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security failure of that technology could harm our business. Increased global cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our information systems and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. There have been several recent, highly publicized cases in which organizations of various types and sizes have reported the unauthorized disclosure of customer or other confidential information, as well as cybersecurity incidents involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information, intellectual property, cash or other valuable assets. There have also been several highly publicized cases in which hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer or other confidential information or for not disabling the target company s computer or other systems. Implementing security 

 53 

Table of Contents 
 measures designed to prevent, detect, mitigate or correct these or other cybersecurity threats involves significant costs. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, we have, from time to time, experienced cyberattacks or other cybersecurity incidents that have threatened our data and information systems, including malware and computer virus attacks and it is possible that future cybersecurity incidents we may experience may materially and adversely affect our business. We cannot provide assurance that our safety and security measures will prevent our information systems from improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cybersecurity incidents. Any IT security threats that are successful against our security measures could, depending on their nature and scope, lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, operational disruptions, and substantial financial outlays. Further, a cybersecurity incident could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection, and an investigation of any successful cybersecurity incident would likely require significant time, costs and other resources to complete. We may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such cybersecurity incidents. In addition, our information technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss and telecommunications failures. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, harm our business relationships or increase our security and insurance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. NG Advantage may not be successful. NG Advantage provides virtual pipelines to transport CNG by truck from compression facilities to pipeline interconnects and to industrial and commercial customer users that do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines. NG Advantage faces unique risks, including among others: (i) it has a history of net losses and has incurred substantial indebtedness; (ii) NG Advantage may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available, may only be available on onerous terms, or may only be available from the Company; (iii) the labor market for truck drivers is very competitive, which increases NG Advantage s difficulty in meeting its delivery obligations; (iv) NG Advantage often transports CNG in trailers over long distances and these trailers may be involved in accidents; and (v) NG Advantage s CNG trailers may become subject to new or changed regulations that could adversely affect its business. If NG Advantage fails to manage any of these risks, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, prospects and reputation may be harmed. In addition, we have been a significant source of financing for NG Advantage. If NG Advantage needs to raise additional capital and is not able to obtain financing from external sources, we may need to provide additional debt or equity capital to allow NG Advantage to satisfy its commitments and maintain operations. Our station construction activities subject us to business and operational risks. As part of our business activities, we design and construct vehicle fueling stations that we either own and operate ourselves or sell to our customers. These activities require a significant amount of judgment in determining where to build and open fueling stations, including predictions about fuel demand that may not be accurate for any of the locations we target. As a result, we have built stations that we may not open for fueling operations, and we may open stations that fail to generate the volume or profitability levels we anticipate, either or both of which could occur due to a lack of sufficient customer demand at the station locations or for other reasons. For any stations that are completed but unopened, we would have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenue, and for any stations that are open and underperforming, we may decide to close the stations. For example, we have nearly completed stations that are not open for fueling operations. We do not know when or if these stations will open, and some of these stations are subject to agreements that may expire prior to us being able to open such stations. Closure of these and/or any other stations could result in substantial additional costs and non-cash asset impairments or other charges and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We also face many operational challenges in connection with our station design and construction activities. For example, we may not be able to identify suitable locations for the stations we or our customers seek to build. Additionally, even if preferred sites can be located, we may encounter land use or zoning difficulties, problems with utility services, challenges obtaining and retaining required permits and approvals or local resistance, including due to reduced operations of permitting agencies because of health crises, any of which could prevent us or our customers from building new stations on these sites or limit or restrict the use of new or existing stations. Any such difficulties, resistance or limitations or any 

 54 

Table of Contents 
 failure to comply with local permit, land use or zoning requirements could restrict our activities or expose us to fines, reputational damage or other liabilities, which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we act as the general contractor and construction manager for new station construction and facility modification projects, and we typically rely on licensed subcontractors to perform the construction work. We may be liable for any damage we or our subcontractors cause or for injuries suffered by our employees or our subcontractors employees during the course of work on our projects. Additionally, shortages of skilled subcontractor labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. Further, our expected profit from a project is based in part on assumptions about the cost of the project, and cost overruns, delays or other execution issues may, in the case of projects we complete and sell to customers, result in our failure to achieve our expected margins or cover our costs, and in the case of projects we build and own, result in our failure to achieve an acceptable rate of return. If any of these events occur, our business, operating results and liquidity could be negatively affected. We have significant contracts with government entities, which are subject to unique risks. We have, and expect to continue to seek, long-term fueling station construction, maintenance and fuel sale contracts with various government bodies, which accounted for 31 , 27 and 30 of our revenue in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. In addition to normal business risks, including the other risks discussed in these risk factors, our contracts with government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. For example, long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. Further, the termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our government contracts or any other governmental action that results in reduced support for our government contracts could result in the loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to the contract. Moreover, government entities with which we contract are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts with us at their convenience and without prior notice, and would only be required to pay for work completed and commitments made at or prior to the time of termination. In addition, government contracts are frequently awarded only after competitive bidding processes, which are often protracted. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders for government contracts are provided the opportunity to formally protest the contract awards through various agencies or other administrative and judicial channels. The protest process may substantially delay a successful bidder s contract performance, result in cancellation of the contract award entirely and distract management. As a result, we may not be awarded contracts for which we bid, and substantial delays or cancellation of contracts may follow any successful bids as a result of any protests by other bidders. The occurrence of any of these risks would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict. Our results of operations have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including, among others, the amount and timing of our vehicle fuel sales, Environmental Credit sales and recognition of government credits, station construction sales, grants and incentives, such as AFTC (for example, we recorded all of the AFTC revenue associated with our vehicle fuel sales made in the first and second quarters of 2022 during the third quarter of 2022); fluctuations in commodity, station construction and labor costs; fluctuations in expenditures and resource commitments due to new ADG RNG project developments; variations in the fair value of certain of our derivative instruments that are recorded in revenue; sales of compressors and other equipment used in RNG production and at fueling stations; the amount and timing of our billing, collections and liability payments; weather and seasonality; and the other factors described in these risk factors. Our performance in certain periods has also been affected by transactions or events that have resulted in significant cash or non-cash gains or losses. These or other similar gains or losses may not recur, in the same amounts or at all in future periods. These significant fluctuations in our operating results may render period-to-period comparisons less meaningful, especially with respect to periods heavily impacted by effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and investors in our securities should not rely on the results of one period as an indicator of performance in any other period. Additionally, these fluctuations in our operating results could cause our performance in any period to fall below the financial guidance we may have provided to the public or the estimates and projections of the investment community, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and may continue to adversely affect, and a future pandemic or epidemic may adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased costs on equipment and construction services, and longer lead times on equipment and materials orders. Any future pandemic, epidemic, or infectious disease outbreak could also adversely affected our business through delaying the adoption of our RNG and natural gas vehicle fuels by heavy-duty trucks and/or a delaying increased usage of our vehicle fuels; decreasing the volume of truck and fleet operations, including shuttle buses at airports, and public transportation generally, and disrupting production of vehicles and engines that use our fuels. Any of the foregoing may result in decreased demand for our vehicle fuels, plant closures, decreased manufacturing capacity, and delays in deliveries, which would negatively impact our business, operations, and financial condition. Our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, and other personnel. Our future success is dependent on the services and performance of our executive officers and other key management, engineering, information technology, scientific, manufacturing and operating personnel. The loss of the services of any such personnel could materially adversely affect our business. Our ability to achieve our strategic plans will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Recruiting key personnel in our industry is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. Our inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, or the departure of key employees, could materially and adversely affect our strategic plans and, therefore, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our inability to attract and retain sufficient personnel to quickly increase production at our facilities when and if needed to meet increased demand may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Other Capital Resources. We may need to raise additional capital to continue to fund our business, which could have negative effects and may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. We require capital to pay for capital expenditures, operating expenses, any mergers, acquisitions or strategic investments, capital calls related to our joint ventures, transactions or relationships we may pursue, and to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. If we cannot fund any of these activities with capital on-hand or cash provided by our operations, we may seek additional capital from other sources, such as by selling assets or pursuing debt or equity financing. Asset sales and equity or debt financing may not be available when needed, on terms favorable to us or at all. Any sale of our assets to generate cash proceeds may limit our operational capacity and could limit or eliminate any revenue streams or business plans that are dependent on the sold assets. Any issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock to raise capital would dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. Any debt financing we may pursue could require us to make significant interest or other payments and to pledge some or all of our assets as security. In addition, higher levels of indebtedness could increase our risk of non-repayment, adversely affect our creditworthiness, and amplify the other risks associated with our existing debt, which are discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing any capital-raising transactions, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees. On the other hand, if we are unable to obtain capital in amounts sufficient to fund our obligations, expenses, and strategic initiatives, we could be forced to suspend, delay or curtail our business plans or operating activities or could default on our contractual commitments. Any such outcome could negatively affect our business, performance, liquidity, and prospects.

 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our credit agreement and other indebtedness we may incur, and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt. On December 12, 2023, we and our wholly-owned direct subsidiary Clean Energy entered into a senior secured first lien term loan agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto Lenders and Alter Domus Products Corp., as the administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders and collateral agent for the secured parties, pursuant to which the Lenders funded a 300,000,000 senior secured term loan and committed to making an additional 100,000,000 of delayed draw term loans available for the two-year period after closing. As of September 30, 2024, we had total consolidated indebtedness of 267.2 million, net of debt discount, and we may incur additional debt in the future. Our outstanding and any future indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic conditions, including rising interest rates, regulatory, and competitive conditions, limit our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business or industry, place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, or limit our ability to borrow or otherwise raise additional capital as needed. Our payments of amounts owed under our various debt instruments will reduce our cash resources available for other purposes, including pursuing strategic initiatives, transactions or other opportunities, satisfying our other commitments, and generally supporting our operations. Moreover, our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, including those described in these risk factors, and many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash from operations to service our debt. If we cannot meet our debt obligations from our operating cash flows, we may pursue one or more alternative measures. Any repayment of our debt with equity, however, would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. We are permitted under the Credit Agreement to incur additional debt under certain conditions. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. The Credit Agreement requires us and our subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, to comply with a maximum total net leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, and a minimum liquidity test. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, dispose of assets, make investments, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate, amend our charter documents and certain other agreements, and enter into speculative hedging arrangements. In the event of any default on our debt obligations, the holders of the indebtedness could, among other things, declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable and foreclose on our assets that serve as collateral. Any such declaration could deplete all or a large portion of our available cash flow, and thereby reduce the amount of cash available to pursue our business plans or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations, which could result in unexpected costs. We provide product warranties with varying terms and durations for the stations we build and sell, and we establish reserves for the estimated liability associated with these warranties. Our warranty reserves are based on historical trends and any specifically identified warranty issues known to us, and the amounts estimated for these reserves could differ materially from the warranty costs we may actually incur. We would be adversely affected by an increase in the rate or volume of warranty claims or the amounts involved in warranty claims, any of which could increase our costs beyond our established reserves and cause our cash position and financial condition to suffer. Risks Related to Environmental Health and Safety and Governmental and Environmental Regulations Our business is influenced by environmental, tax and other government regulations, programs and incentives that promote our vehicle fuels, and their modification or repeal could negatively affect our business. Our business is influenced by federal, state, and local tax credits, rebates, grants and other government programs and incentives that promote or exclude the use of our vehicle fuels. These include various government programs that make grant funds available from the purchase of vehicles and construction of fueling stations, as well as the AFTC under which we generate revenue for our vehicle fuel sales. Additionally, our business is influenced by laws, rules and regulations that require reductions in carbon emissions and/or the use of renewable fuels, such as the programs under which we generate Environmental Credits. 

 57 

Table of Contents 
 These programs and regulations, which have the effect of encouraging the use of RNG as a vehicle fuel, could expire or be repealed or amended for a variety of reasons. For example, parties with an interest in gasoline and diesel, electric or other alternative vehicles or vehicle fuels, including lawmakers, regulators, policymakers, environmental or advocacy organizations, producers of alternative vehicles or vehicle fuels, or other powerful groups, may invest significant time and money in efforts to delay, repeal or otherwise negatively influence regulations and programs that promote RNG. Many of these parties have substantially greater resources and influence than we have. Further, challenges to agencies rules and regulations and their interpretations of such rules and regulations, and changes in federal, state or local political, social or economic conditions, including as a result of a lack of legislative focus on these programs and regulations or prolonged U.S. government shutdown, could result in their modification, delayed adoption or repeal. For example, the IRA contains credits and tax incentives that may be beneficial to us but interagency guidance processes are still ongoing. Any failure to adopt, delay in implementing, expiration, repeal or modification of these programs and regulations, or the adoption of any programs or regulations that encourage the use of other alternative fuels or alternative vehicles over RNG, could reduce the market for RNG as a vehicle fuel and harm our operating results, liquidity, and financial condition. To benefit from Environmental Credits, RNG projects are required to be registered and are subject to audit. RNG projects are required to register with the EPA and relevant state regulatory agencies. Further, we qualify our RINs through a voluntary Quality Assurance Plan, which typically takes from three to five months from first injection of RNG into the commercial pipeline system. We also must certify RNG pathways with CARB, which typically takes from 15-18 months from first injection of RNG into the commercial pipeline system. Delays in obtaining registration, RIN qualification, and any LCFS credit qualification of a new project could delay future revenues from a project and could adversely affect our cash flow. Further, we may make large investments in projects prior to receiving the regulatory approval and RIN qualification. By registering RNG projects with the EPA s voluntary Quality Assurance Plan and by establishing RNG pathways under CARB s LCFS program, we are subject to third-party audits and on-site visits of projects to validate generated RINs and overall compliance with the federal renewable fuel standard and the LCFS. We are also subject to a separate third party s annual attestation review. The Quality Assurance Plan provides a process for RIN owners to follow, for an affirmative defense to civil liability, if used or transferred Quality Assurance Plan verified RINs were invalidly generated. A project s failure to comply could result in remedial action, including penalties, fines, retirement of RINs, or termination of the project s registration, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws, orders or regulations mandating new or additional limits on GHG emissions, tailpipe emissions or internal combustion engines. Federal or state laws, orders or regulations have been adopted, such as California s AB 32 cap and trade law, and may in the future be adopted that impose limits on GHG emissions or otherwise require the adoption of zero-emission electric vehicles. The effects of GHG emission limits on our business are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of any requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of GHG emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, the range of available compliance alternatives, and our ability to demonstrate that our vehicle fuels qualify as a compliance alternative under any statutory or regulatory programs to limit GHG emissions. If our vehicle fuels are not able to meet GHG emission limits or perform as well as other alternative fuels and vehicles, our solutions could be less competitive. Furthermore, additional federal or state taxes could be implemented on tailpipe emissions or on methane emissions generally, which would have a negative impact on the cost of our vehicle fuels, as compared to vehicle fuels that do not generate tailpipe emissions. In June 2020, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which requires manufacturers to sell a gradually increasing proportion of zero-emission electric trucks, vans and pickup trucks from 2024 onwards. By the year 2045, the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation seeks to have every new commercial vehicle sold in California be zero-emissions. Further, in September 2020, the Governor of the State of California issued an executive order (the September 2020 Executive Order providing that it shall be the goal of California that (i) 100 of in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks will be zero-emission by 2035, (ii) 100 of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles in California will be zero-emission by 2045 for all operations, where feasible, and by 2035 for drayage trucks, and (iii) the state will transition to 

 58 

Table of Contents 
 100 zero-emission off-road vehicles and equipment by 2035 where feasible. The September 2020 Executive Order also directed CARB to develop and propose regulations and strategies aimed at achieving the foregoing goals. Resulting regulations mandate increasing adoption of zero-emission vehicles. In April 2023, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation, which requires all truck fleets be zero emission by 2042. The Advanced Clean Fleets regulation also seeks to end the sale of combustion trucks in California in 2036. Among other things, we believe the intent of the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, the September 2020 Executive Order, and the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation is to limit and ultimately discontinue the production and use of internal combustion engines because such engines have tailpipe emissions. Implementation of such regulations and executive actions may slow, delay or prevent the adoption by fleets and other commercial customers of our vehicle fuels, particularly in California. Moreover, other states have taken steps to enact similar regulations, which may slow, delay, change, or prevent the adoption of our vehicle fuels in those states as well. These actions could result in state funding and incentive programs being directed only to the adoption of zero emission vehicles. In December 2021, President Biden signed an executive order (the 2021 Executive Order that directs the federal government to achieve certain goals, including purchasing 100 zero-emission vehicles by 2035 for its fleet of over 600,000 cars and trucks. Our business is subject to a variety of government regulations, including environmental regulations, which may restrict our operations and result in costs and penalties or otherwise adversely affect our business and ability to compete. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, the government procurement process, any political activities or lobbying in which we may engage, public reporting and taxation, among others. It is difficult and costly to manage the requirements of every authority having jurisdiction over our various activities and to comply with their varying standards. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, may be unclear and difficult to interpret and have become more stringent over time. Any changes to existing regulations, adoption of new regulations, or judicial rulings regarding such regulations, may result in significant additional expense to us or our customers. For example, our operations are and will be subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Contamination at properties we own or operate, will own or operate, or formerly owned or operated to which hazardous substances were sent by us, are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. Further, from time to time, as part of the regular evaluation of our operations, including newly acquired or developing operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities, which may distract management from our revenue-generating activities and involve significant costs and use of other resources. Also, we often need to obtain facility permits or licenses to address, among other things, storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling and air emissions in connection with our operations, which may subject us to onerous or costly permitting conditions or delays if permits cannot be timely obtained. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in property damage, bodily injury or a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including, among others, assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of corrective requirements, including cleanup costs, or prohibition from providing services to government entities. If any of these enforcement measures were imposed on us, our business, financial condition, and performance could be negatively affected. Our operations entail inherent safety and environmental risks, which may result in substantial liability to us. Our operations entail inherent safety risks, including risks associated with equipment defects, malfunctions, failures, and misuses. For example, operation of LNG pumps requires special training because of the extremely low temperatures of LNG. Also, LNG tanker trailers and CNG fuel tanks and trailers could rupture if involved in accidents or improper maintenance or installation. Further, improper refueling of vehicles that use our fuels or operation of vehicle fueling stations could result in sudden releases of pressure that could cause explosions. In addition, our operations may result in the venting of methane, which is flammable and is a potent GHG. These safety and environmental risks could result in uncontrollable flows of our fuels, fires, explosions, death, or serious injury, any of which may expose us to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. We may incur substantial liability and costs if any such damages are not covered by insurance or are more than policy limits, or if environmental

 damage causes us to violate applicable GHG emissions or other environmental laws. Additionally, the occurrence of any of these events with respect to our fueling stations or our other operations could materially harm our business and reputation. Moreover, the occurrence of any of these events to any other organization in our vehicle fuel business could harm our industry generally by negatively affecting perceptions about, and adoption levels of, our vehicle fuels. Risks Related to Our Common Stock A significant portion of our outstanding common stock is owned or otherwise subject to acquisition by three equityholders, each of which may have interests that differ from the Company s other stockholders and which now or in the future may be able to influence the Company s corporate decisions, including a change of control. After giving effect to the issuance of the Amazon Warrant and the Stonepeak Warrant (defined below), Total Marketing Services, S.A.S TMS ), a wholly owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies, owns approximately 19 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2024. In addition, TotalEnergies was granted certain special rights that our other stockholders do not have in connection with its acquisition of this ownership position, including the right to designate two individuals to serve as directors of our Company and a third individual to serve as an observer on certain of our board committees. The Amazon Warrant was immediately exercisable by Amazon Holdings for 4.999 of our outstanding common stock when issued. Subject to additional vesting through fuel purchase from the Company pursuant to the Fuel Agreement, the Amazon Warrant will be exercisable for up to 19.999 of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis (determined at the time of issuance), subject to certain anti-dilution provisions, and Amazon Holding s beneficial ownership will initially be contractually limited to the beneficial ownership limitation unless Amazon Holdings gives the Company sixty one (61) days notice that it is waiving such limitation. The Stonepeak Warrant is exercisable at any time after December 12, 2025 for up to 9.999 of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, and Stonepeak s beneficial ownership will initially be contractually limited to such beneficial ownership limitation unless Stonepeak gives the Company sixty one (61) days notice that it is waiving such limitation. TotalEnergies or other current or future large stockholders may be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, mergers and acquisitions, or other extraordinary transactions. Large stockholders may have interests that differ from other stockholders and may vote or otherwise act in ways with which the Company or other stockholders disagree or that may be adverse to your interests. A concentration of stock ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock as part of a sale of our Company and could affect the market price of our common stock. Conversely, such a concentration of stock ownership may facilitate a change of control under terms other stockholders may not find favorable or at a time when other stockholders may prefer not to sell. Sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, regardless of the state of our business. All outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Also, shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise, vesting or conversion of our outstanding stock options and restricted stock units may be eligible for sale in the public market, to the extent permitted by Rule 144 and the provisions of the applicable stock option and restricted stock unit agreements or if such shares have been registered under the Securities Act. Sales of large amounts of our common stock by large stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of the state of the Company s business. Our common stock held by TMS, our common stock underlying the Amazon Warrant, and our common stock underlying the Stonepeak Warrant may be sold in the public market under Rule 144 or in registered sales or offerings pursuant to registration rights held by each stockholder. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they may be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.

 The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. Factors that may cause volatility in the price of our common stock, many of which are beyond our control, include, among others, the following: (i) the factors that may influence the adoption of our vehicle fuels, as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors; (ii) our ability to implement our business plans and initiatives and their anticipated, perceived or actual level of success; (iii) failure to meet or exceed any financial guidance we have provided to the public or the estimates and projections of the investment community; (iv) the market s perception of the success and importance of any of our acquisitions, divestitures, investments or other strategic relationships or transactions; (v) the amount and timing of sales of, and prices for, Environmental Credits; (vi) actions taken by state or federal governments to mandate or otherwise promote or incentivize alternative vehicles or vehicle fuels over, or to the exclusion of, RNG; (vii) technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our common stock, access to margin debt, and trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock; (viii) changes in political, regulatory, health, economic and market conditions; and (ix) a change in the trading volume of our common stock. In addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, but which have affected the market prices of these companies securities. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Volatility or declines in the market price of our common stock could have other negative consequences, including, among others, further impairments to our assets, potential impairments to our goodwill and a reduced ability to use our common stock for capital-raising, acquisitions or other purposes. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and could cause further declines in the market price of our common stock. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures None. Item 5. Other Information Rule 10b5-1 Plan Elections .

The Company will also indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on the Indemnitee s behalf in connection with any such proceeding or defense, in whole or in part, to which the Indemnitee is a party or participant and in which the Indemnitee is successful.

Exhibit 10.1 CLEAN ENERGY FUELS CORP. INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT This Indemnification Agreement Agreement is made as of ________ __, 20__ by and between Clean Energy Fuels Corp., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and ______________ Indemnitee ). This Agreement supersedes and replaces any and all previous Agreements between the Company and Indemnitee covering the subject matter of this Agreement. RECITALS WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board believes that highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors, officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation; WHEREAS, the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the Certificate of Incorporation require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ). The Bylaws, Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the Board, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification; WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification may increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons; WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future; WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Bylaws and the Certificate of Incorporation and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, as well as any rights of Indemnitees under any directors and officers liability insurance policy, and this Agreement shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and may not be willing to serve or continue to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve in such capacity. Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: Section 1. Services to the Company . Indemnitee agrees to serve as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Enterprise. Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise) and Indemnitee. Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that Indemnitee s employment with the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise), if any, is at will, and the Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, except as may be otherwise provided in any written employment contract between Indemnitee and the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise), other applicable formal 

 severance policies duly adopted by the Board, or, with respect to service as a director or officer of the Company, by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, and the DGCL. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as an officer, director, agent, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Enterprise, as provided in Section 16 hereof. Section 2. Definitions . As used in this Agreement: References to agent shall mean any person who is or was a director, officer, or employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company or other person authorized by the Company to act for the Company, to include such person serving in such capacity as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or other official of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at the request of, for the convenience of, or to represent the interests of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.

Any Person (as defined below) is or becomes the Beneficial Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifteen percent (15 or more of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding securities unless the change in relative Beneficial Ownership of the Company s securities by any Person results solely from a reduction in the aggregate number of outstanding shares of securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; ii. Change in Board of Directors. During any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in Sections 2(b)(i), 2(b)(iii) or 2(b)(iv)) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company s stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; iii. Corporate Transactions. The effective date of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the Surviving Entity (as defined below)) more than 50 of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Surviving Entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and with the power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or other governing body of such Surviving Entity; iv.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Independent Counsel shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement.

Section 3. Indemnity in Third-Party Proceedings . The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of a criminal Proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful. The parties hereto intend that this Agreement shall provide to the fullest extent permitted by law for indemnification in excess of that expressly permitted by statute, including, without limitation, any indemnification provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, vote of the Company s stockholders or disinterested directors or applicable law. Section 4. Indemnity in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company . The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4 if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No indemnification for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been finally adjudged by a court to be liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court (as hereinafter defined) or any court in which the Proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite 
 -4- 

 the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification. Section 5. Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with or related to each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter to the fullest extent permitted by law. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. Section 6. Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, a witness, is or was made (or asked) to respond to discovery requests in any Proceeding, or otherwise asked to participate in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection therewith. Section 7. Partial Indemnification . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Section 8. Additional Indemnification . Notwithstanding any limitation in Sections 3, 4, or 5, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law if Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant in any Proceeding (including a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status. For purposes of Section 8(a), the meaning of the phrase to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law shall include, but not be limited to: i. to the fullest extent permitted by the provision of the DGCL that authorizes or contemplates additional indemnification by agreement, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL, and ii. to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors. Section 9. Exclusions . Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnification payment in connection with any claim involving Indemnitee: for which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any insurance policy or other indemnity provision; or 
 -5- 

 for (i) an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 2(b) hereof) or similar provisions of state statutory law or common law, (ii) any reimbursement of the Company by the Indemnitee of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by the Indemnitee from the sale of securities of the Company, as required in each case under the Exchange Act (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), or the payment to the Company of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) or (iii) any reimbursement of the Company by Indemnitee of any compensation pursuant to any compensation recoupment or clawback policy adopted by the Board or the compensation committee of the Board, including but not limited to any such policy adopted to comply with stock exchange listing requirements implementing Section 10D of the Exchange Act; except as provided in Section 14(d) of this Agreement, in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation, (ii) such payment arises in connection with any mandatory counterclaim or cross claim brought or raised by Indemnitee in any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding), (iii) indemnification is expressly required by the Delaware General Corporate Law DGCL ), (iv) there has been a Change of Control, or (v) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law; or for (i) circumstances in which indemnity is expressly prohibited under the DGCL, or (ii) for any acts or omissions or transactions from which a director may not be relieved of liability under the DGCL. Section 10. Advances of Expenses . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than Section 14(d)), the Company shall advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, the Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) not initiated by Indemnitee or any Proceeding initiated by Indemnitee with the prior approval of the Board as provided in Section 9(c), and such advancement shall be made within (i) twenty (20) days after the receipt by the Company of a written statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding, for current and former directors and officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) the later of twenty (20) days following receipt by the Company of a written statement or statements therefor and determination by the Company to advance expenses pursuant to the Company s discretionary authority, for employees or agents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Advances shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement. In accordance with Section 14(d), advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the advances claimed. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement, which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts advanced (without interest) by the Company pursuant to this Section 10, if and only to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. No other form of undertaking shall be required other than the execution of this Agreement. This Section 10 shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 9. Section 11. Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim . Indemnitee shall notify the Company in writing of any matter with respect to which Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by Indemnitee of written notice thereof. The written notification to the Company shall include a description of the nature of the Proceeding and the facts underlying the Proceeding. To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification following the final disposition of such Proceeding. The omission by Indemnitee to notify the Company hereunder will not relieve the Company from 
 -6- 

 any liability which it may have to Indemnitee hereunder or otherwise than under this Agreement, and any delay in so notifying the Company shall not constitute a waiver by Indemnitee of any rights under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense. The Company shall not settle any Proceeding (in whole or in part) if such settlement would impose any Expense, judgment, liability, fine, penalty or limitation on Indemnitee in respect of which Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder without Indemnitee s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent. Section 12. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification . Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(a), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company at a meeting at which a quorum is present, with the share owned by the Indemnitee not being entitled to vote thereon; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or Expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. The Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 12(a) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 12(b). If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided , however , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or the Delaware Court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after the later of submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof and the final disposition of the Proceeding, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee 
 -7- 

 may petition the Delaware Court for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by such court or by such other person as such court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 12(a) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 14(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing). If the Company disputes a portion of the amounts for which indemnification is requested, the undisputed portion shall be paid and only the disputed portion withheld pending resolution of any such dispute. Section 13. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings . In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 11(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Subject to Section 14(e), if the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 12 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 13(b) shall not apply (i) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement and if A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy-five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement. The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, arbitration award or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification, except as expressly prohibited under this Agreement, or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful. For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial 
 -8- 

 statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser, financial advisor or other expert selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 13(d) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. Section 14. Remedies of Indemnitee . Subject to Section 14(e), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 12 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 or the second to last sentence of Section 12(a) of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 8 of this Agreement is not made within sixty (60) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, or (vi) the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or Proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of Indemnitee s entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at Indemnitee s option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within ninety (90) days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 14(a). The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration. In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 12(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law. The Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 14 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. It is the intent of the Company that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder. The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after receipt by the 
 -9- 

 Company of a written request therefor) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advancement of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company if, in the case of indemnification, Indemnitee is wholly successful on the underlying claims; if Indemnitee is not wholly successful on the underlying claims, then such indemnification shall be only to the extent Indemnitee is successful on such underlying claims or otherwise as permitted by law, whichever is greater. The Company and Indemnitee agree that Indemnitee shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement without the necessity of proving actual damages or irreparable harm. The Company and Indemnitee further agree that Indemnitee shall be entitled to such injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking in connection therewith. Any such requirement of bond or undertaking is hereby waived by the Company, and the Company acknowledges that in the absence of such a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required by the court. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding. Section 15. Insurance. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that, so long as Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company and thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible Proceeding, the Company, subject to Section 15(c), shall maintain an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Company in full force and effect. In all director and officer insurance policies, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits, subject to the same limitations, as are accorded to the Company s directors, officers, employees or agents most favorably insured by such policy. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of such claim or of the commencement of a Proceeding, as the case may be, to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to maintain directors and officers insurance if the Company determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, the premium costs for such insurance are disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, or the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide an insufficient benefit. Section 16. Non-exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Subrogation . The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise and (ii) shall be interpreted independently of, and without reference to, any other such rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by Indemnitee in Indemnitee s Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Bylaws, Certificate of 
 -10- 

 Incorporation and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy. In the event of any payment made by the Company under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (or for which advancement is provided hereunder) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise. The Company s obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. Section 17. Duration of Agreement . This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) ten (10) years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Enterprises or (b) one (1) year after the final termination of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding (including any appeal thereof) commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement relating thereto. The indemnification and advancement of expenses rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of any other Enterprise, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee s spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other legal representatives. The Company shall require and shall cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company to, by written agreement, expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. Section 18. Severability . Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require or shall be construed as requiring the Company to do or fail to do any act in violation of applicable law. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby. Section 19. Enforcement . The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve as a director or officer of the Company, 
 -11- 

 and the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in serving or continuing to serve as a director or officer of the Company. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, any directors and officers insurance maintained by the Company and applicable law, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder. Section 20. Modification and Waiver . No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. Section 21. Notice by Indemnitee . Indemnitee agrees promptly to notify the Company in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding or matter which may be subject to indemnification or advancement of Expenses covered hereunder. The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise. Section 22. Notices . All notices, requests, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (a) delivered by hand and receipted for by the party to whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed, (b) mailed by certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, on the third business day after the date on which it is so mailed, (c) mailed by reputable overnight courier and receipted for by the party to whom said notice or other communication shall have been directed or (d) sent by facsimile transmission, with receipt of oral confirmation that such transmission has been received: If to Indemnitee, at the address indicated on the signature page of this Agreement, or such other address as Indemnitee shall provide to the Company.

Section 23. Contribution . To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s). Section 24. Applicable Law and Consent to Jurisdiction . This Agreement and the legal relations among the parties shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Except with respect to any arbitration commenced by

 Indemnitee pursuant to Section 14(a) of this Agreement, the Company and Indemnitee hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Delaware Court ), and not in any other state or federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other country, (ii) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, (iii) waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Delaware Court, and (iv) waive, and agree not to plead or to make, any claim that any such action or proceeding brought in the Delaware Court has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum. Section 25. Identical Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement. Section 26. Miscellaneous . Use of the masculine pronoun shall be deemed to include usage of the feminine pronoun where appropriate. The headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof.
