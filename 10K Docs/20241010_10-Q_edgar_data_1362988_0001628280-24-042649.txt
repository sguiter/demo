 Market Investments, at fair value: Investment in debt securities Income Investment in equity securities Market/Income Total investments, at fair value 
 Our cash and cash equivalents consist largely of money market securities that are highly liquid and easily tradable. These securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities (Level 1). Our investments in debt and equity securities consist of notes and shares received as a result of claims settlements from various airline customers that had entered into bankruptcy proceedings or similar-type restructurings. Our investment in equity securities that are traded in an active market have been valued using quoted market prices (Level 1). Our investments in other equity securities and debt securities for which there is no active market or there is limited market data have been valued using the income approach (Level 3). 
 For the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, we had transfers into or out of Level 3. 
 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
 We measure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities on a non-recurring basis, when U.S. GAAP requires the application of fair value, including events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Assets subject to these measurements include our aircraft and unconsolidated equity method investment. 
 We record aircraft at fair value when we determine the carrying value may not be recoverable. Fair value measurements for aircraft in impairment tests are based on the average of the market approach (Level 2 or 3), which includes third-party appraisal data, and an income approach (Level 3), which includes the Company s assumptions and appraisal data as to the present value of future cash proceeds from leasing and selling aircraft. Level 3 valuations contain significant non-observable inputs. See Aircraft Valuation below for further information. 
 We account for our unconsolidated equity method investment under the equity method of accounting. Our investment is recorded at cost and is adjusted by undistributed earnings and losses and the distributions of dividends and capital. This investment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value is less than its carrying value and the decline is other-than-temporary. 
 Financial Instruments 
 Our financial instruments, other than cash, consist principally of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments in debt and equity securities, accounts payable and secured and unsecured financings. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates the carrying value of these financial instruments because of their short-term nature. 
 The fair value of our investments, which consist of debt and equity securities, have been valued using either quoted market prices to the extent such securities are traded in an active market (Level 1), or using the income approach for those securities where there is no active market or there is limited market data (Level 3). The fair value of our senior notes is

 Impairment of Flight Equipment 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recorded a transactional impairment charge of million related to a lease amendment for aircraft. The Company recognized million of maintenance revenue for this aircraft during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recorded transactional impairment charges totaling million related to a scheduled aircraft lease expiration and a lease amendment. The Company recognized million of maintenance revenue for these aircraft during the six months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Annual Recoverability Assessment 
 We will perform our annual recoverability assessment of all our aircraft during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 When we perform a recoverability assessment, we measure whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the aircraft exceed its net book value. The undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted lease rentals and maintenance payments, future projected lease rates and maintenance payments, transition costs, estimated down time, and estimated residual or scrap values for an aircraft. In the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test, the aircraft will be adjusted to fair value, resulting in an impairment charge. 
 Management develops the assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry, as well as information received from third-party industry sources. The factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in projected lease rental and maintenance payments, residual values, economic conditions, technology, airline demand for a particular aircraft type and other factors, such as the location of the aircraft and accessibility to records and technical documentation.

 Update on Russian Aircraft 
 The Company leased aircraft to Russian airlines that were unrecoverable following Russia s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Company filed claims against the reinsurers of the Russian airlines insurance and the Company s contingent and possessed insurance policies C P Policies seeking indemnity. 
 During the year ended February 29, 2024, the Company received cash settlement proceeds of million in settlement of certain of the Company s claims under the insurance policies in respect of aircraft formerly on lease to Russian airlines. The Company will continue to explore mitigating losses with respect to the other aircraft that were not included in the prior settlement, but it is uncertain whether this will result in any further settlements and, if so, in what amount. 
 The receipt of the insurance settlement proceeds serve to mitigate, in part, the Company s losses under its aviation insurance policies. The Company reserves all rights under its C P Policies. The collection, timing and amount of any future recoveries, including those related to insurance litigation, remain uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, the Company can give no assurance as to when or what amounts it may ultimately collect with respect to these matters.

 Non-U.S. operations ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and earnings of unconsolidated equity method investment ) 
 Our aircraft-owning subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the United States and typically are not subject to U.S. federal, state or local income taxes. The aircraft owning subsidiaries resident in the United States and Ireland are subject to tax in those respective jurisdictions. 
 We have a U.S.-based subsidiary which provides management services to our subsidiaries and is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. We also have Ireland and Singapore-based subsidiaries which provide management services to our non-U.S. subsidiaries and are subject to tax in those respective jurisdictions. 
 We recognized income tax provisions of million and million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the mix of profits in taxable and non-taxable jurisdictions. 
 Ireland and Bermuda Tax Law Changes 
 On December 18, 2023, Ireland enacted Finance (No. 2) Bill 2023 (the Finance Bill which includes legislative changes for new tax measures and amendments to the Irish tax code, such as provisions to implement the Pillar Two GloBE rules, new outbound payment rules, and a dividend withholding tax, among other changes. The Finance Bill requires a 20 withholding tax be applied to certain payments, such as interest payments, from Irish companies to recipients in no-tax and zero-tax jurisdictions, effective April 1, 2024. The Finance Bill also requires a 25 withholding tax be applied to dividends and distributions, subject to certain exemptions, as well as introduces new interest deduction rules for a qualifying finance company. The Company has determined that there is no current year impact from the law change. 
 On December 18, 2023, Bermuda enacted the Bermuda CIT Act which imposes the 15 Bermuda CIT that applies to Bermuda businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with annual revenue of 750 million or more and is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The Company has appropriately considered the impact of the Bermuda CIT and its impact on current and deferred income taxes.

OVERVIEW 
 Aircastle acquires, leases, and sells commercial jet aircraft to airlines throughout the world. We are a leading secondary market investor that sources aircraft through various acquisition channels that primarily include other aircraft lessors, airlines through purchase-leaseback transactions, financial institutions and other aircraft owners, and aircraft manufacturers. We have significant experience in successfully managing aircraft throughout their life cycle, including lease and technical management, aircraft redeliveries, transitions, and sales or disposals. We sell aircraft and engine assets, either with a lease attached or on a part-out basis, with the aim of generating profits and reinvesting proceeds. Our aircraft are managed by an experienced team based in the United States, Ireland and Singapore. 
 As of August 31, 2024, we owned and managed on behalf of our joint venture 253 aircraft leased to 78 airline customers located in 46 countries. The net book value of our fleet (flight equipment held for lease and net investment in leases, or Net Book Value was 7.1 billion as of August 31, 2024. The weighted average age of our fleet was 9.7 years, and the weighted average remaining lease term was 5.3 years. The weighted average utilization rate of our fleet was 99 for the six months ended August 31, 2024. During the six months ended August 31, 2024, we purchased 13 aircraft and sold 12 aircraft and other flight equipment. As of August 31, 2024, we had commitments to purchase 11 aircraft for 377.2 million, with deliveries through the first quarter of 2028, which included estimated amounts for pre-delivery deposits, contractual price escalations and other adjustments. 
 Our total revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA were 421.8 million, 44.7 million and 385.0 million, respectively, for the six months ended August 31, 2024. Cash flow provided by operating activities was 204.9 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024. The Company s financial performance reflects the continued expansion of global air traffic and strong demand for our aircraft through lease extension requests, primarily due to Original Equipment Manufacturer production issues and delivery delays, as well as the improved financial health of our airline customers. 
 Growth in commercial air traffic has been correlated with world economic activity and has historically grown at a rate one to two times that of global gross domestic product growth. This expansion of air travel has driven growth in the world aircraft fleet. There are approximately 26,000 commercial mainline passenger and freighter aircraft in the world fleet today. Aircraft leasing companies own approximately 52 of the world s commercial passenger jet aircraft. Under normal circumstances, we would expect the global fleet to continue expanding at a 2 to 3 average annual rate. 
 We believe our portfolio, which is primarily comprised of new technology and mid-life, narrow-body aircraft, will remain attractive assets for our airline customers to respond to the growing demand of global air travel. As a leading secondary market investor, we believe that our long-standing business strategy of maintaining conservative leverage and limiting long-term financial commitments positions us well to take advantage of new investment opportunities as they arise. 
 We employ a team of experienced senior professionals with extensive industry and financial experience. Our leadership team has an average of more than 30 years of relevant industry experience and has effectively enabled us to manage through prior downturns in the aviation industry, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the 2001 terror attacks. 
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our contractual obligations over the next twelve months. As of October 1, 2024, total liquidity of 3.1 billion included 2.1 billion of undrawn credit facilities, 0.5 billion of projected adjusted operating cash flows and contracted asset sales and 0.5 billion of unrestricted cash through October 1, 2025. 
 
 Acquisitions and Sales 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024, we purchased 13 aircraft for 343.5 million. As of August 31, 2024, we had commitments to purchase 11 aircraft for 377.2 million, with delivery through the first quarter of 2028, which included estimated amounts for pre-delivery deposits, contractual price escalations and other adjustments. As of October 4, 2024, we have purchased 1 additional aircraft and have commitments to purchase 15 aircraft for 566.7 million. 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024, we sold 12 aircraft and other flight equipment for net proceeds of 329.3 million and recognized a net gain on the sale of 36.4 million for these aircraft and other flight equipment. As of October 4, 2024, we have sold 1 additional aircraft. 
 
 22 

Fiscal Year 2024 Lease Expirations and Lease Placements 
 As of October 1, 2024, we had 1 off-lease aircraft and 1 aircraft with a lease expiring in fiscal year 2024, which combined account for less than 1 of our Net Book Value at August 31, 2024, remaining to be placed or sold. Of these 2 aircraft, we expect to transition 1 aircraft to a new lessee and sell or part out the other aircraft. 
 Fiscal Year 2025-2028 Lease Expirations and Lease Placements 
 Taking into account lease and sale commitments, we currently have the following number of aircraft with lease expirations scheduled in the fiscal years 2025 to 2028, representing the percentage of our Net Book Value as of August 31, 2024, specified below: 
 2025: 17 aircraft, representing 6 ; 
 2026: 34 aircraft, representing 12 ; 
 2027: 31 aircraft, representing 11 ; and 
 2028: 30 aircraft, representing 10 . 
 Finance 
 We operate in a capital-intensive industry and have a demonstrated track record of raising substantial amounts of capital from debt and equity investors. Since our inception in late 2004, we have raised 2.6 billion in equity capital from private and public investors, including 500.0 million received during the past 12 months in respect of the Subscription Agreement entered into with our Shareholders see Note 9 in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have raised 22.5 billion in debt capital from a variety of sources, including export credit agency-backed debt, commercial bank debt, the aircraft securitization markets and the unsecured bond market. The diversity and global nature of our financing sources demonstrate our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and seize new growth opportunities. 
 We intend to fund new investments through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, maintenance payments received from lessees, equity offerings, unsecured bond offerings, borrowings secured by our aircraft, draws under our revolving credit facilities and proceeds from any future aircraft sales. We may repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long-term debt financings, additional equity offerings or cash generated from operations and asset sales. Therefore, our ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets, depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our business is very capital intensive, requiring significant investments in order to expand our fleet and to maintain and improve our existing portfolio. Our operations have historically generated a significant amount of cash, primarily from lease rentals and maintenance collections. We have also met our liquidity and capital resource needs by utilizing several sources over time, including: 
 unsecured indebtedness, including our current unsecured revolving credit facilities and senior notes; 
 various forms of borrowing secured by our aircraft, including term facilities, term financings and limited recourse securitization financings for new aircraft acquisitions; 
 asset sales; and 
 issuance of common and preference shares. 
 Going forward, we expect to continue to seek liquidity from these sources and other sources, subject to pricing and conditions we consider satisfactory. 
 During the six months ended August 31, 2024, we met our liquidity and capital resource needs with 204.9 million of cash flows from operations and 329.3 million of proceeds from the sale or disposition of aircraft and other flight equipment. 
 As of August 31, 2024, the weighted average maturity of our secured and unsecured debt financings was 3.5 years, and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our contractual obligations over the next twelve months. As of October 1, 2024, total liquidity of 3.1 billion included 2.1 billion of undrawn credit facilities, 0.5 billion of projected adjusted operating cash flows and contracted asset sales and 0.5 billion of unrestricted cash through October 1, 2025. In addition, we believe payments received from lessees and other funds generated from operations, unsecured bond offerings, borrowings secured by our aircraft, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and other borrowings and proceeds from future aircraft sales will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months. Our liquidity and capital resource needs include payments due under our aircraft purchase obligations, required principal and interest payments under our long-term debt facilities, expected capital expenditures, lessee maintenance payment reimbursements and lease incentive payments.

Cash Flows 
 Six Months Ended August 31, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Net cash flow provided by operating activities 204,903 186,415 Net cash flow used in investing activities (7,484) (250,512) Net cash flow provided by financing activities 105,168 558,664 
 Operating Activities: 
 Cash flow provided by operating activities was 204.9 million and 186.4 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is attributable to higher customer cash collections and maintenance payments received by us and recognized into income during the six months ended August 31, 2024, partially offset by higher cash paid for interest. 
 Investing Activities: 
 Cash flow used in investing activities was 7.5 million and 250.5 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Proceeds from the sale or disposition of aircraft and other flight equipment increased 203.3 million during the six months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Financing Activities: 
 Cash flow provided by financing activities was 105.2 million and 558.7 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 453.5 million was primarily attributable to a 551.4 million increase in repayments of secured and unsecured financings, net of borrowings, partially offset by a 100.0 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. 
 
 Debt Obligations 
 For complete information on our debt obligations, refer to Note 8 in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our contractual obligations primarily consist of principal and interest payments on debt financings, aircraft acquisitions and rent payments pursuant to our office leases. Total contractual obligations decreased to 5.8 billion at August 31, 2024 from 6.1 billion at February 29, 2024, due to lower outstanding debt and aircraft purchase commitments, partially offset by higher interest obligations. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 From time to time, we make capital expenditures to maintain or improve our aircraft. These expenditures include the cost of major overhauls necessary to place an aircraft in service and modifications made at the request of lessees. For the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred a total of 15.0 million and 44.3 million, respectively, of capital expenditures, including lease incentives, related to the improvement of aircraft. 
 As of August 31, 2024, the weighted average age by Net Book Value of our aircraft was approximately 9.7 years. In general, the costs of operating an aircraft, including maintenance expenditures, increase with the age of the aircraft. Our lease agreements call for the lessee to be primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft. Maintenance reserves are generally paid by the lessee to provide for future maintenance events. Provided a lessee performs scheduled maintenance of the aircraft, we are required to reimburse the lessee for scheduled maintenance payments. In certain cases, we are also required to make lessor contributions, in excess of amounts a lessee may have paid, towards the costs of maintenance events performed by or on behalf of the lessee. We may incur additional maintenance and modification costs in the future in the event we are required to remarket an aircraft or a lessee fails to meet its maintenance obligations under the lease agreement. 
 33 

Actual maintenance payments to us by lessees in the future may be less than projected as a result of a number of factors, such as in the event of a lessee default. Maintenance reserves may not cover the entire amount of actual maintenance expenses incurred and, where these expenses are not otherwise covered by the lessees, there can be no assurance that our operational cash flow and maintenance reserves will be sufficient to fund maintenance requirements, particularly as our aircraft age. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Risks related to our leases If lessees are unable to fund their maintenance obligations on our aircraft, we may incur increased costs at the conclusion of the applicable lease in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have an unconsolidated equity method investment in an aircraft leasing entity with Mizuho Leasing. We hold a 25 equity interest in this entity, which was established to help expand our base of new business opportunities. As of August 31, 2024, the Net Book Value of its 9 aircraft was 264.9 million. 
 The assets and liabilities of this entity are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, and we record our net investment under the equity method of accounting. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Operations 
 At August 31, 2024, approximately 99 of our leases were payable to us in U.S. dollars. However, we incur Euro- and Singapore dollar-denominated expenses in connection with our subsidiaries in Ireland and Singapore. For the six months ended August 31, 2024, expenses, such as personnel and office costs, denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar totaled 10.5 million in U.S. dollar equivalents and represented approximately 25 of total selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Our international operations are a significant component of our business strategy and permit us to more effectively source new aircraft, service the aircraft we own and maintain contact with our lessees. Therefore, our international operations and our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely increase over time. Although we have not yet entered into foreign currency hedges, if our foreign currency exposure increases, we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to mitigate this risk. For the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred insignificant net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. 
 
 Management s Use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We use EBITDA to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance, and we believe this non-U.S. GAAP measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance. 
 This measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals, as well as achieving optimal financial performance. It provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed. 
 EBITDA provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Accordingly, this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely the cost structure, or expenses, of the organization. EBITDA is one of the metrics used by senior management and the Board of Directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (as defined above) further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance as that term is defined in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants. 
 
 34 

The table below shows the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended August 31, Six Months Ended August 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 28,659 5,518 44,740 28,288 Depreciation 87,675 86,328 177,033 175,117 Amortization of lease premiums, discounts and incentives 6,068 7,124 12,717 14,331 Interest, net 62,424 57,035 127,237 113,926 Income tax provision (benefit) 9,028 (5,099) 12,600 9,261 EBITDA 193,854 150,906 374,327 340,923 Adjustments: Impairment of flight equipment 5,761 1,100 10,972 2,197 Gain on extinguishment of debt (285) (285) Adjusted EBITDA 199,330 152,006 385,014 343,120 
 
 Limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 An investor or potential investor may find EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA important measures in evaluating our performance, results of operations and financial position. We use these non-U.S. GAAP measures to supplement our U.S. GAAP results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be viewed in isolation or as substitutes for U.S. GAAP measures of income (loss). Material limitations in making the adjustments to our income (loss) to calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and using these non-U.S. GAAP measures as compared to U.S. GAAP net income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations and cash flows provided by or used in operations, include: 
 depreciation and amortization, though not directly affecting our current cash position, represent the wear and tear and/or reduction in value of our aircraft, which affects the aircraft s availability for use and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures; 
 the cash portion of income tax provision (benefit) generally represents charges (gains), which may significantly affect our financial results; and 
 adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance as that term is defined in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not alternatives to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You should not rely on these non-U.S. GAAP measures as a substitute for any such U.S. GAAP financial measure. We strongly urge you to review the reconciliations to U.S. GAAP net income (loss), along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We also strongly urge you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. In addition, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this report, may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. These risks are highly sensitive to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. We are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates. Our primary interest rate exposures relate to our floating-rate debt obligations. Rent payments under our aircraft lease agreements typically do not vary during the term of the lease according to changes in interest rates. However, our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index, such as SOFR or an alternative reference rate. Therefore, to the extent our borrowing costs are not fixed, increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities. 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 The following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis, which models the effects of hypothetical interest rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe a sensitivity analysis provides the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, it is constrained by several factors, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by the inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. Although the following results of a sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rates may have some limited use as a benchmark, they should not be viewed as a forecast. This forward-looking disclosure also is selective in nature and addresses only the potential interest expense impacts on our financial instruments. It also does not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of changes in interest rates. 
 As of August 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100-basis point increase/decrease in our variable interest rate on our borrowings would result in an interest expense increase/decrease of 3.2 million and 3.2 million, respectively, over the next twelve months. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 31, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

The New Subsidiary Guarantor will have the right to seek contribution from any future non-paying Guarantor, if any, so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.

Section 2.2. Limitation on Guarantor Liability. The Note Guarantee by the New Subsidiary Guarantor will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the New Subsidiary Guarantor without rendering the Note Guarantee voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

The New Subsidiary Guarantor may not consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not New Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person, another Person other than the Company or another future Guarantor, if any), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless 
 (a) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists and
