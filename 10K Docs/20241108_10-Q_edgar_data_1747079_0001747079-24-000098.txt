Management has analyzed and concluded that Breckenridge Curacao B.V. Breckenridge is a VIE because it does not have sufficient equity investment at risk. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE because (a) although the Company does not control all decisions of Breckenridge, the Company has the power to direct the activities of Breckenridge that most significantly impact its economic performance through various contracts with the entity and (b) the nature of these agreements between Breckenridge and the Company provides the Company with the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits based on fees that are based upon off-market rates and commensurate to the level of services provided. The Company receives significant benefits in the form of fees that are not at market and commensurate to the level of services provided. As a result, the Company consolidates all of the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Breckenridge and its subsidiaries in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

 The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.

As of December 31, 2023, the total value of the liability was million, with million recorded within Accrued and other current liabilities related to the short-term portion of the liability, and million related to the long-term portion of the liability reflected as Commercial rights liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

In the first quarter of 2024, the Company s obligation to pay Diamond for the naming rights terminated upon the bankruptcy court s approval of certain settlement terms, which the court approved on March 1, 2024. Refer to Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies for further information. 
 
 Under the Framework Agreement, the Company issued to SBG (i) an immediately exercisable warrant to purchase up to shares of the Company at an exercise price of per share the Penny Warrants ), (ii) a warrant to purchase up to a maximum of additional shares of the Company at a price of per share subject to the achievement of various performance metrics (the Performance Warrants ), and (iii) an option to purchase up to additional shares in four tranches with purchase prices ranging from to per share, exercisable over a seven-year period beginning on the fourth anniversary of the November 18, 2020 closing (the Options ). The exercise and purchase prices and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and options are subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.

The 2023 year to date effective tax rate was higher than the US federal statutory tax rate of 21 , largely due to an increase in the valuation allowance and a tax liability for a discrete item related to the deferred gain on sale-leaseback transactions in Mississippi and Rhode Island.

 Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 Cross Currency Swaps - The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments it holds in its European foreign entities. The Company uses fixed and fixed-cross-currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the foreign exchange rate on its foreign investment in Europe and their exposure to changes in the EUR-GBP exchange rate. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the USD-EUR exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in USD for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. Cross-currency swaps involve the receipt of functional-currency-fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making foreign-currency-fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement. These derivative arrangements qualify as net investment hedges under ASC 815, with the gain or loss resulting from changes in the spot value of the derivative reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts are reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Additionally, the accrual of foreign currency and USD denominated coupons will be recognized in Interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 11 Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 Stockholders Equity for further information. 
 
 Cross currency swaps 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 Interest Rate Contracts - The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to hedge its exposure to variability in cash flows on a portion of its floating-rate debt, to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and collars as part of its financial risk and liability management policy. The Company s interest rate swaps and collars are designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815. The changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into Interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in the same period in which the hedged interest payments associated with the Company s borrowings are recorded. Refer to Note 11 Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 Stockholders Equity for further information.

 Interest Rate Contracts and Cross Currency Swaps 
 
 The fair values of interest rate contracts and cross currency swap assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on estimates using currency spot and forward rates and standard pricing models that consider the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard pricing models utilize inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves as well as currency spot and forward rates. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Sinclair Performance Warrants 
 
 Sinclair Performance Warrants are accounted for as a derivative instrument classified as a liability within Level 3 of the hierarchy as the warrants are not traded in active markets and are subject to certain assumptions and estimates made by management related to the probability of meeting performance milestones. These assumptions and the probability of meeting performance targets may have a significant impact on the value of the warrant. The Performance Warrants are valued using an option pricing model, considering the Company s estimated probabilities of achieving the performance milestones for each tranche. Inputs to this valuation approach include volatility between and , risk free rates between and , the Company s common stock price for each period and expected terms between and years. The fair value is recorded within Commercial rights liabilities of the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Overview 
 
 We are a global gaming, hospitality and entertainment company with a portfolio of casinos and resorts and online gaming businesses. We provide our customers with physical and interactive entertainment and gaming experiences, including traditional casino offerings, iGaming, online bingo, sportsbook and free-to-play F2P games. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we own and manage 15 land-based casinos in 10 states across the United States US ), one golf course in New York, and one horse racetrack in Colorado operating under the Bally s brand. Our land-based casino operations include approximately 14,900 slot machines, 550 table games and 3,800 hotel rooms, along with various restaurants, entertainment venues and other amenities. In 2021, we acquired London-based Gamesys Group Ltd. Gamesys to expand our geographical and product footprints to include an iGaming business with well-known brands providing iCasino and online bingo experiences to our global online customer base with concentrations in Europe and Asia and a growing presence in North America. Our revenues are primarily generated by these gaming and entertainment offerings. Our proprietary software and technology stack is designed to allow us to provide consumers with differentiated offerings and exclusive content. 
 
 Our Strategy and Business Developments 
 
 We seek to continue to grow our business by actively pursuing the acquisition and development of new gaming opportunities and reinvesting in our existing operations. We believe that interactive gaming represents a significant strategic opportunity for the future growth of Bally s and we will continue to actively focus resources in markets that we believe will regulate iGaming. We seek to increase revenues at our casinos and resorts through enhancing the guest experience by providing popular games, restaurants, hotel accommodations, entertainment and other amenities in attractive surroundings with high-quality guest service. We believe that our recent acquisitions have expanded and diversified us from financial and market exposure perspectives, while continuing to mitigate our susceptibility to regional economic downturns, idiosyncratic regulatory changes and increases in regional competition. 
 
 We continue to make progress on the integration of our acquired assets and deploying capital on our strategic growth projects. These steps have positioned us as a prominent, full-service, vertically integrated iGaming company, with physical casinos and online gaming solutions united under a single, leading brand. 
 
 Agreement and Plan of Merger 
 
 On July 25, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement with SG Parent, LLC, The Queen Casino Entertainment, Inc. Queen ), Epsilon Sub I, Inc. Merger Sub I ), Epsilon Sub II, Inc. Merger Sub II )and, solely for purposes of specified sections thereof, SG CQ Gaming LLC SG Gaming ). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, in connection with the closing of the transaction, SG Gaming will contribute to the Company all shares of common stock of Queen that it owns in exchange for shares of common stock of the Company, immediately thereafter, Merger Sub I will merge into the Company with the Company surviving such merger and immediately thereafter, Merger Sub II will merge into Queen with Queen surviving such merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Refer to Note 1 General Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the Merger Agreement and the mergers. 
 
 Carved-Out Business 
 
 On October 31, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to carve-out components of its interactive business in Asia and certain other international markets in its International Interactive reportable segment (the Carved-Out Business to a company (the Buyer formed by members of the management of the Carved-Out Business. The Buyer is acquiring the net-assets, predominantly working capital, of the Carved-Out Business, in exchange for a seven-year term note in the principal amount of 30 million, subject to applicable interest. Certain intellectual property used in the Carved-Out Business has been placed in trust, with royalty licensing fees paid to the trust by the Buyer for a term of five years (subject to extension). All royalty licensing fees, net of trustee administrative expenses, are paid to the Company by the trust and are expected to be reported by the Company as licensing revenues. The Company will also provide the Carved-Out Business with certain transition services. In connection with the separation transaction, the Company will acquire penny warrants that represent a 19.9 fully-diluted interest in the Buyer, which is expected to result in the deconsolidation of the Carved-Out Business. Bally s will have no role in the management or operational governance of the Carved-Out Business. 
 
 The separation transaction is intended to allow Bally s to focus its capital and resource allocation on North American and European business, and the Carved-Out Business will benefit from focused management attention and aligned ownership. 
 
 45 

Post transaction, the financial statements of the Company will only reflect licensing and royalty revenues received from a trust that it licenses to the Buyer, which are expected to be lower than revenues recorded under the current accounting treatment. However, the licensing and royalty revenues received from the Buyer are expected to be at higher profitability margins, leading to a modest decrease in Income from operations on an annualized basis after giving effect to the transaction. The gain or loss on sale of the net-assets of the Carved-Out Business has not yet been determined as it is subject to valuation procedures and associated goodwill allocation, the release of accumulated currency translation adjustments for the disposed entities, and other post-closing adjustments. The goodwill allocation, as well as the completion of a re-assessment of the Company s goodwill reporting units and long-lived asset groups upon completion of the separation transaction, could result in material impairment charges. Long-lived assets, predominantly intellectual property (including those to be held in trust), subject to the cash flows of the Carved-Out Business are 332.0 million as of September 30, 2024.

Rhode Island Regulatory Agreement 
 
 We are party to an Amended and Restated Regulatory Agreement (the Regulatory Agreement ), with the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation DBR and the State Lottery Division of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue DoL ). The Regulatory Agreement contains financial and other covenants that, among other things, (i) restrict the acquisition of stock and other financial interests in us, (ii) relate to the licensing and composition of members of our management and Board of Directors (the Board ), (iii) prohibit certain competitive activities and related-party transactions and (iv) restrict our ability to declare or make restricted payments (including dividends), incur additional indebtedness or take certain other actions, if our leverage ratio exceeds 5.50 to 1.00 (in general being gross debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA, each as defined in the Regulatory Agreement). 
 
 The Regulatory Agreement also provides affirmative obligations, including setting a minimum number of employees that we must employ in Rhode Island and providing the DBR and DoL with periodic information updates about us. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any properties in Rhode Island (other than Bally s Twin River and Bally s Tiverton), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire. A failure to comply with the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island. 
 
 In addition, our master contracts with Rhode Island extended through June 30, 2043, and allow for consolidation of promotional points between Bally s Twin River and Bally s Tiverton, obligate Bally s Twin River to build a 50,000 square foot expansion, obligate Bally s to lease at least 20,000 square feet of commercial space in Providence, and commit us to invest 100 million in Rhode Island over the term, including an expansion and the addition of new amenities at Bally s Twin River. As a licensed Technology Provider since July 1, 2021, Bally s Twin River is entitled to an additional share of net terminal income on Video Lottery Terminals VLTs which they owned or leased. June 2021 legislation in Rhode Island also authorized a joint venture between Bally s and IGT Global Solutions Corporation IGT to become a licensed technology provider and supply the State of Rhode Island with all VLTs at both Bally s Twin River and Bally s Tiverton for a 20.5-year period starting January 1, 2023. The joint venture was organized as the Rhode Island VLT Company, LLC, with IGT owning 60 of the membership interests and Bally s or its affiliates owning 40 of the membership interests RI Joint Venture ). On December 30, 2022, Bally s Twin River and Bally s Tiverton purchased additional machines directly from IGT to effectively own 40 of the machines. On January 1, 2023, Bally s Twin River and Bally s Tiverton contributed all of their machines to the RI Joint Venture in return for an aggregate 40 membership interest, and IGT contributed all of their machines at Bally s Twin River and Bally s Tiverton to the RI Joint Venture in return for a 60 membership interest. 
 
 Macroeconomic and Other Factors 
 
 Our business is subject to risks caused by global economic challenges, including those caused by public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of global and regional conflicts, rising inflation, rising interest rates and supply-chain disruptions, that can cause economic uncertainty and volatility. These challenges can negatively impact discretionary consumer spending and could result in a reduction in visitors to our properties, including those that stay in our hotels, or discretionary spending by our customers on entertainment and leisure activities. In addition, inflation generally affects our business by increasing our cost of labor. In periods of sustained inflation, it may be difficult to effectively control such increases to our costs and retain key personnel. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 
 The key performance indicator used in managing our business is consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDAR which are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings, or loss, for the Company, or where noted its reporting segments, before, in each case, interest expense, net of interest income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-operating (income) expense, acquisition and other transaction related costs, share-based compensation and certain other gains or losses as well as, when presented for our reporting segments, an adjustment related to the allocation of corporate cost among segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDAR is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) for the Company s reportable segments, plus rent expense associated with triple net operating leases with GLPI for the real estate assets used in the operation of the Bally s casinos and the assumption of the lease for real estate and land underlying the operations of the Bally s Lake Tahoe property. 
 
 47 

We use consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDAR to analyze the performance of our business and they are used as determining factors for performance-based compensation for members of our management team. We use consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDAR when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a more fulsome understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period performance. Also, we present consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDAR because they are used by some investors and creditors as indicators of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations, including our ability to service debt, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDAR information is presented because management believes that they are commonly used measures of performance in the gaming industry and that they are considered by many to be key indicators of our operating results. 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR is used outside of our financial statements solely as a valuation metric. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR is defined as consolidated Adjusted EBITDA plus rent expense associated with triple net operating leases. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR is an additional metric used by analysts in valuing gaming companies subject to triple net leases since it eliminates the effects of variability in leasing methods and capital structures. This metric is included as supplemental disclosure because (i) we believe Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR is used by gaming operator analysts and investors to determine the equity value of gaming operators and (ii) financial analysts refer to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR when valuing our business. We believe Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR is useful for equity valuation purposes because (i) its calculation isolates the effects of financing real estate, and (ii) using a multiple of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR to calculate enterprise value allows for an adjustment to the balance sheet to recognize estimated liabilities arising from operating leases related to real estate. 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as alternatives to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, as indicators of our performance. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and segment Adjusted EBITDAR as used by us may not be defined in the same manner as other companies in our industry, and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance or considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, because it excludes the rent expense associated with our triple net operating leases with GLPI and the lease for real estate and land underlying the operations of the Bally s Lake Tahoe property.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Total Revenue 
 
 Total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Gaming 523,906 508,895 15,011 2.9 1,564,714 1,489,086 75,628 5.1 Hotel 41,672 56,728 (15,056) (26.5) 118,026 155,451 (37,425) (24.1) Food and beverage 35,403 39,438 (4,035) (10.2) 103,478 108,270 (4,792) (4.4) Retail, entertainment and other 28,993 27,416 1,577 5.8 83,895 84,596 (701) (0.8) Total revenue 629,974 632,477 (2,503) (0.4) 1,870,113 1,837,403 32,710 1.8 
 
 Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.4 to 630.0 million, from 632.5 million in the same period last year and total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.8 to 1.87 billion, from 1.84 billion in the same period last year. We saw total revenue increase in our Casinos Resorts reportable segment, mainly due to the inclusion of our Bally s Chicago temporary casino property, which contributed approximately 32.6 million and 64.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, partially offset by the incremental decrease in revenue associated with the closure of our Tropicana Las Vegas property during the second quarter of 2024 of approximately 25.0 million and 32.1 million, respectively. Additionally, the expanded operating jurisdictions within our North America Interactive reportable segment contributed incremental revenue of approximately 7.8 million and 33.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year. 
 
 Gaming and Non-gaming Expenses 
 
 Gaming and non-gaming expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.9 million, from 287.2 million in 2023, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 27.0 million, from 828.4 million in 2023. The overall increase in gaming and non-gaming expenses from the prior year was mainly attributable to the inclusion of expenses from our recently opened Bally s Chicago temporary casino which contributed approximately 13.9 million and 46.9 million to the increase in both gaming and non-gaming expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, partially offset by the incremental decrease in expense associated with the closure of our Tropicana Las Vegas property of 13.8 million and 28.9 million, respectively. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 43.0 million from 230.6 million in the same period last year, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 42.3 million from 732.1 million in the same period last year. The year to date fluctuation in general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to higher operating expenses associated with the opening of our Bally s Chicago property and increased Merger Agreement costs in the current year, offset by decreased acquisition and integration costs and severance and employee related restructuring costs compared to prior year. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 77.8 million, an increase of 0.3 million compared to the same period last year, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 316.3 million, an increase of 85.1 million compared to the same period last year. The year to date increase was primarily driven by our Tropicana Las Vegas property, where we recorded accelerated depreciation of 80.1 million on assets as a result of the recent closure of the property on April 2, 2024. 
 
 51 

Income (Loss) From Operations 
 
 Loss from operations was 157.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income from operations of 37.2 million in the same period last year. Loss from operations was 226.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income from operations of 420.0 million in the same period last year. The change year-over-year was driven by the loss on sale-leaseback of 150.0 million related to the lease modification event involving the real estate underlying the Bally s Chicago project in the current year, compared to the gain on sale-leaseback of 374.3 million recorded during the first quarter of 2023 related to our Hard Rock Biloxi and Bally s Tiverton properties, combined with the depreciation at our Tropicana Las Vegas property in the current year, as noted above. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Total other expense increased 68.7 million to 123.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 55.1 million, and increased 83.6 million to 259.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 176.0 million, each compared to the same periods last year. The increase in other expense was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates of our borrowings year-over-year and increased foreign currency losses, partially offset by increased interest income recognized on our derivative instruments. 
 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 
 Benefit for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.6 million and 3.7 million, respectively, compared to provision for income taxes of 43.9 million and 153.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective year to date tax rate for 2024 was 0.8 compared to 62.7 in the prior year. The 2024 year to date effective tax rate differed from the US federal statutory tax rate of 21 , creating a benefit for income tax on the Company s Loss before income taxes, largely due to an increase in the valuation allowance, entirely offset by discrete tax asset related to the sale-leaseback transaction involving the real estate underlying the Bally s Chicago project. The 2023 year to date effective tax rate was higher than the US federal statutory tax rate of 21 , largely due to an increase in the valuation allowance and a tax liability for a discrete item related to the deferred gain on sale-leaseback transactions in Mississippi and Rhode Island. 
 
 On December 15, 2022, the European Union EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15 , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are also implementing similar legislation. The estimated impact of this directive is immaterial to the Company s consolidated financial statements in the current year. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) and Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
 
 Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 247.9 million, or (5.10) per diluted share, compared to 61.8 million, or (1.15) per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 482.0 million, or (9.96) per diluted share, compared to net income of 90.9 million, or 1.67 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR by Segment 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was 137.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 141.6 million for the same period last year. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was 387.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10.3 million, or 2.6 , from 398.0 million in the same period last year. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAR for the Casinos Resorts segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 17.7 million to 100.4 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 44.7 million to 289.7 million, each compared to the same prior year periods. These decreases were primarily attributable to weather impacts across multiple properties and the closure of the Tropicana Las Vegas in the current year, partially offset by the inclusion of Bally s Chicago that opened at the end of the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 52 

Adjusted EBITDAR for the International Interactive segment increased 4.6 million to 90.0 million and increased 4.5 million to 254.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods, driven by softness in our non-UK operations year-over-year, offset by stronger performance in the United Kingdom in the current year. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAR loss for the North America Interactive segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (11.0) million compared to an adjusted EBITDAR loss of (17.6) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDAR loss was (27.9) million compared to an adjusted EBITDAR loss of (45.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in adjusted EBITDAR losses is largely driven by expanded operating jurisdictions and stronger performance in iGaming and sportsbook in the current year. 
 
 The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDAR, which is our reportable segment GAAP measure and our primary measure for profit or loss for our reportable segments, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. The following table reconciles consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, to net income (loss), as derived from our financial statements (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a holding company. Our ability to fund our obligations depends on existing cash on hand, cash flow from our subsidiaries and our ability to raise capital. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities. We assess liquidity in terms of the ability to generate cash or obtain financing in order to fund operating, investing and debt service requirements. Our primary ongoing cash requirements include the funding of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments in line with our business strategy and debt repayment obligations and interest payments. Our strategy has been to maintain moderate leverage and substantial capital resources in order to take advantage of opportunities, to invest in our businesses and acquire properties at what we believe to be attractive valuations. As such, we have continued to invest in our land-based casino business and build on our interactive/iGaming gaming business. We believe that existing cash balances, operating cash flows and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, as explained below, will be sufficient to meet funding needs for operating, capital expenditure and debt service purposes. 
 
 Cash Flows Summary Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 76,178 118,359 Net cash used in investing activities (191,081) (2,247) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 75,708 (79,560) Effect of foreign currency on cash and cash equivalents 4,472 (2,251) Change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held for sale (1,648) Net change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (34,723) 32,653 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 315,262 265,184 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period 280,539 297,837 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 76.2 million, compared to 118.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the changes in working capital, offset by increased foreign currency losses in the current year. 
 
 55 

Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 191.1 million, an increase of 188.8 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by the proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions in the prior year and a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures year-over-year. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 75.7 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 79.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in long-term debt borrowings offset by higher payments made year-over-year and a decrease in stock repurchases. 
 
 Capital Return Program 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 95.5 million available for use under the capital return program, subject to limitations in our regulatory and debt agreements. Future share repurchases may be effected in various ways, which could include open-market or private repurchase transactions, accelerated stock repurchase programs, tender offers or other transactions. The amount, timing and terms of any return of capital transaction will be determined based on prevailing market conditions and other factors. There is no fixed time period to complete share repurchases. 
 
 We did not pay cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, nor do we currently intend to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determinations relating to our dividend policies will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on conditions then existing, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital and regulatory requirements and other factors our Board may deem relevant. 
 
 Debt and Lease Obligations 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 On August 20, 2021, we issued 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625 senior notes due 2029 and 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875 Senior Notes due 2031 (together, the Senior Notes ). 
 
 The indenture governing the Senior Notes contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments, (iii) enter into certain transactions with affiliates, (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, (v) create or incur liens and (vi) merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company s assets. These covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications set forth in the indenture. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 On October 1, 2021, we entered into the Credit Agreement providing for a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 1.945 billion (the Term Loan Facility ), which will mature in 2028, and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 620.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ), which will mature in 2026. 
 
 The credit facilities allow us to increase the size of the Term Loan Facility or request one or more incremental term loan facilities or increase commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility or add one or more incremental revolving facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of 650 million and 100 of the Company s consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period plus or minus certain amounts as specified in the Credit Agreement, including an unlimited amount subject to compliance with a consolidated total secured net leverage ratio. 
 
 56 

The credit facilities contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, sell assets, make certain investments, and grant liens. These covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes certain financial covenants the Company is required to maintain throughout the term of the credit facility. These financial covenants include a provision where, in the event borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 30 of the total revolving commitment, the Company is required to maintain a first lien secured indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 
 During 2023, the Company entered into certain currency swaps to synthetically convert 500 million of its Term Loan Facility to an equivalent fixed-rate Euro-denominated instrument, due October 2028, with a weighted average fixed interest rate of approximately 6.69 per annum. The Company also entered into additional currency swaps to synthetically convert 200 million, notional, of its floating rate Term Loan Facility, to an equivalent GBP-denominated floating rate instrument, due October 2026. Additionally, as part of the Company s risk management program to manage its overall interest rate exposure, the Company entered into a notional aggregate amount of 500 million interest rate collar arrangements maturing in 2028 where the Company s SOFR floating rate interest under its Term Loan Facility is capped at 4.25 , with a weighted average SOFR floor rate of 3.22 , pursuant to the interest rate collar arrangements. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company settled 500.0 million of notional interest rate collars and received 3.9 million in termination payments, reflecting the fair value on the settlement date. Additionally, the Company simultaneously entered into a series of interest rate contracts in a notional aggregate amount of 1.00 billion, to further manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements associated with the Company s variable rate Term Loan Facility through its synthetic conversion to fixed rate debt. The tenor of these contracts were matched with the maturity of the Term Loan Facility tranche maturing on October 1, 2028. 
 
 Refer to Note 10 Derivative Instruments and Note 14 Long-Term Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 Operating Leases 
 
 The Company is committed under various operating lease agreements for real estate and property used in operations. Minimum rent payable under operating leases was 4.17 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which 45.3 million is due within the current year. Refer to Note 15 Leases in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 
 GLPI Leases 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s Bally s Evansville, Bally s Dover, Bally s Quad Cities, Bally s Black Hawk, Bally s Tiverton and Hard Rock Biloxi properties were leased under the terms of a master lease agreement (the Master Lease with GLPI. The Master Lease has an initial term of 15 years and includes four, five-year options to renew and requires combined minimum annual payments of 100.5 million, subject to a minimum 1 annual escalation or greater escalation dependent on CPI. 
 
 During 2023, the Company s Bally s Tiverton and Hard Rock Biloxi properties were added to the Master Lease on January 3, 2023, as a result of a transaction with GLP Capital, L.P. GLP ), an affiliate of GLPI, related to the land and real estate assets for a total consideration of 625.4 million. The transaction was structured as a tax-free capital contribution and a substantial portion of the proceeds were used to reduce the Company s debt. These properties increased the minimum annual payments under the Master Lease by 48.5 million. 
 
 In addition to the properties under the Master Lease, the Company leases the land associated with Tropicana Las Vegas. This lease has an initial term of 50 years (with a maximum term of 99 years with renewal options) at annual rent of 10.5 million, subject to minimum 1 annual escalation or greater escalation dependent on CPI. During the third quarter, the Company entered into a lease modification, whereby GLPI funded 48.6 million to the Company for the demolition of the building at the Tropicana Las Vegas site in exchange for increasing annual rent by 4.1 million. 
 
 57 

In the third quarter of 2024, GLP acquired the real estate underlying the Bally s Chicago project, assuming the existing lease, for which the Company was subject to a 200.0 million financing obligation. Reclassifying the lease as an operating lease due to the transfer of control of the land asset from the Company to the lessor, permitted sale recognition, resulting in the Company derecognizing the 350.0 million land asset and the 200.0 million the long-term financing obligation, and recording a 150.0 million loss on sale-leaseback. 
 
 Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a Binding Term Sheet to form a strategic construction and financing arrangement with GLP, which includes the funding to complete the construction of Bally s Chicago permanent casino. GLP will amend the existing land lease through a new master lease agreement with Bally s Chicago Operating Company, LLC Chicago MLA ). The Chicago MLA includes annual rent of 20 million, subject to customary escalation provisions. The Chicago MLA will also provide up to 940 million in construction financing, subject to conditions and approvals. The Company will pay additional rent under the Chicago MLA based on a 8.5 capitalization rate on funded amounts. The initial lease term for the Chicago MLA is 15 years with renewal options to be agreed upon by the parties. 
 
 The Company will also sell and lease back from GLP its properties in Kansas City and Shreveport for 395 million, with initial annual rent of 32.2 million, subject to escalation. In addition, the Company plans to sell and lease back its Bally s Twin River property to GLP by 2026 for 735 million, with initial annual rent of 58.8 million. GLP has the right to call this transaction starting October 2026. All such transactions are subject to required regulatory approvals. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditures are accounted for as either project, maintenance or capitalized software expenditures. Project capital expenditures are for fixed asset additions that expand an existing facility or create a new facility. Maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to replace existing fixed assets with a useful life greater than one year that are obsolete, worn out or no longer cost effective to repair, along with spending on other small projects that do not fit into the project category. Capitalized software expenditures relate to the creation, production and preparation of software for use in our online gaming operations. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, capital expenditures were 155.8 million compared to 266.2 million in the same period last year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued our spending on our planned projects and maintenance at our casino properties, the most significant being our future Bally s Chicago permanent facility. 
 
 Bally s Twin River - In connection with our partnership with IGT, we have committed to invest 100 million in Bally s Twin River over the term of our master contract, ending in 2043, with Rhode Island to expand the property and add additional amenities along with other capital improvements. As a major component of this, we have constructed and opened a 14,000 square foot Korean-style spa, and a 40,000 square foot casino expansion, both of which opened in the first half of 2023. Approximately 48.2 million of the committed investment remains as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Bally s Atlantic City - Construction on our Bally s Atlantic City property commenced in 2021. We are committed to invest approximately 100 million over five years to refurbish and upgrade Bally s Atlantic City s facilities and expand its amenities, including renovated hotel rooms and suites, outdoor beer hall and lobby bar. As of September 30, 2024, all investment requirements had been met and no commitment to invest in non-hotel projects remains. 
 
 Centre County, PA - In September 2024, we issued a termination notice to cancel the framework agreement entered into on December 31, 2020 to design, develop, construct and manage a Category 4 licensed casino in Centre County, Pennsylvania. We concluded that market circumstances have changed and that such development at this point no longer fits with our strategic objectives. In accordance with the provisions of the framework agreement, we paid a termination fee of 5 million and the charge is reflected the quarter ending September 30, 2024. 
 
 58 

Bally s Chicago - On June 9, 2022, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, Bally s Chicago Operating Company, LLC (the Developer ), signed a host community agreement with the City of Chicago to develop a destination casino resort, to be named Bally s Chicago, in downtown Chicago, Illinois that will include approximately 3,400 slot machines, 170 table games, 10 food and beverage venues, 500 hotel rooms, a 65,000 square foot entertainment and event center, 20,000 square feet of exhibition space, 3,300 parking spaces and an outdoor green space. The project also provides the Company with the exclusive right to operate a temporary casino for up to three years while the permanent casino resort is constructed. The temporary casino commenced operations on September 9, 2023 at the Medinah Temple and includes approximately 800 gaming positions and 3 food and beverage venues. The Company currently estimates the permanent casino construction to be completed by the end of 2026. In 2024, we estimate spending of approximately 190.2 million primarily dedicated to demolition and site preparation. We expect future funding of the permanent casino construction to be financed through the GPLI agreement noted above. 
 
 In connection with the entry into the host community agreement with the City of Chicago, the Company will be required to pay annual fixed host community impact fees of 4.0 million. Additionally, in connection with the host community agreement, the Company provided the City of Chicago with a performance guaranty whereby the Company agreed to have and maintain available financial resources in an amount reasonably sufficient to allow the Developer to complete its obligations under the host community agreement. In addition, upon notice from the City of Chicago that the Developer has failed to perform various obligations under the host community agreement, the Company has indemnified the City of Chicago against any and all liability, claim or reasonable and documented expense the City of Chicago may suffer or incur by reason of any nonperformance of any of the Developer s obligations. 
 
 In furtherance of these obligations, the host community agreement requires us to spend at least 1.34 billion on the design, construction and outfitting of our temporary casino and our permanent resort and casino. The actual cost of the development may exceed this minimum capital investment requirement. In addition, land acquisition costs and financing costs, among other types of costs, do not count towards satisfying such minimum expenditure. 
 
 Other Contractual Obligations 
 
 Sponsorship Commitments - The Company has entered into several sponsorship agreements with various professional sports leagues and teams, allowing the Company use of official league marks for branding and promotions, among other rights. As of September 30, 2024, obligations related to these agreements were 129.8 million, with contracts extending through 2037. 
 
 Interactive Technology Partnerships - The Company has certain multi-year agreements with its various market access and content providers, as well as its online sports betting platform partners, that require the Company to pay variable fees based on revenue, with minimum annual guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, the cumulative minimum obligation committed in these agreements is approximately 54.7 million, extending through 2029. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate long-term debt arrangements and foreign currency risk attributable to our operations outside of the US. Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor. Bally s does not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, interest on borrowings under our credit facility was subject to fluctuation based on changes in short-term interest rates. On September 30, 2024, we had 2.24 billion of variable rate debt outstanding under our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facilities and 1.49 billion of unsecured senior notes. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our debt levels on September 30, 2024, a hypothetical increase of 1 in the effective interest rate would cause an increase in interest expense of approximately 22.4 million over the next twelve months while a decrease of 1 in the effective interest rate, not to exceed the interest rate floor, would cause a decrease in interest expense of approximately 22.4 million over the same period. 
 
 59 

We evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace and we have utilized derivative financial instruments to help manage this risk. As part of the Company s risk management and hedging program, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps and collars used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility as described in Note 10, Derivative Instruments to our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We have not historically utilized derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We do not believe that fluctuations in interest rates had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the US. A vast majority of our revenues are from the UK market and are conducted in British Pound Sterling GBP and are therefore susceptible to any movements in exchange rates between the GBP and US Dollar. Foreign currency transaction losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 30.2 million and 26.4 million, respectively, while foreign currency transaction gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 8.5 million and 2.5 million, respectively. Movements in currency exchange rates could impact the translation of assets and liabilities of these foreign operations which are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. We have utilized operational hedges or forward currency exchange rate contracts, as well as derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (principal financial officer), conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures for the reporting period ended September 30, 2024 as such terms is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Ongoing Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 
 
 The Company s management is in the process of designing and implementing effective measures to improve our internal controls over financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses. These remediation actions are ongoing and include: 
 
 Realigning resources and, where applicable, hiring qualified staff or using third-party subject matter experts with the appropriate level of experience and training to segregate key functions within our financial processes in order to support the review of significant and complex accounting matters, including appropriately analyzing, recording and disclosing accounting matters timely and accurately, specifically around assumptions used in certain estimates. 
 Educating control owners within our International Interactive reportable segment of the appropriate design elements of journal entry controls and enhancing our monitoring control to ensure that these control activities are performed and that journal entries have a separate preparer and independent reviewer. 
 Strengthening controls over account reconciliations and account analyses within our International Interactive reportable segment to support financial reporting requirements. Specifically, controls will address the timeliness of the review and the quality of information used in the review to ensure completeness and accuracy. 
 Implementing a new enterprise resource planning ERP system, which we believe will enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and control and provide timely information to our management team will enable us to remediate segregation of duties over journal entries. As the implementation of the new ERP system progresses, we may change our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in further changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 While we believe our remediation efforts above will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure that the measures will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified or will prevent 
 60 

potential future material weaknesses. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 61 

PART II 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are party to various legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of our business. Such proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings will not materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to mitigate the risks of such proceedings, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. Estimated losses are accrued for these proceedings when the loss is probable and can be estimated. The current liability for the estimated losses associated with these proceedings is not material to our consolidated financial condition and those estimated losses are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes to our risk factors contained in Part I. Item IA. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
