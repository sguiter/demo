FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INDUSTRY DATA 

This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that if they materialize or prove incorrect, could cause the results of Ceva to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally written in the future tense and/or are preceded by words such as will, may, should, could, expect, suggest, believe, anticipate, intend, plan, or other similar words. Forward-looking statements include the following: 

Our belief that our portfolio of wireless communications and sensing and edge AI technologies address some of the most important megatrends, including 5G, generative AI, embedded AI, industrial automation and vehicle electrification, and our belief in the continued interest in our IP portfolio due to these trends, in both traditional and new areas; 

Our belief that our Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ultra Wide Band (UWB) and cellular IoT IPs allow us to address the high volume IoT industrial, consumer and smart home markets, and our expectation that the overall addressable market size will be more than 15 billion devices annually by 2027 based on research from ABI Research; 

Our belief that Wi-Fi represents a significant royalty revenue opportunity in connection with our leading market position in licensing Wi-Fi 6 and our leadership position in Wi-Fi 7 IP; 

Our belief that our PentaG2 platform, including the recently announced CevaXC22 multi-thread DSP, ensures we offer the most comprehensive baseband processor IP platform in the industry today, and that our 5G IPs provide newcomers and incumbents with a customizable solution to address the need for 5G, 5G Advanced and other communications in data centers and infrastructure; 

Our belief that the high volume consumer audio markets, including True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds, smartwatches, AR and VR headsets, and other wearable assisted devices, offers an incremental growth segment for our Bluetooth, Audio AI DSPs and software IPs, and our belief in the capabilities of our RealSpace Spatial Audio Head Tracking Solution, WhisPro speech recognition technology and ClearVox voice input software to enhance the user experience and offer premium features; 

Our belief that our SensPro2 sensor hub AI DSP family can address the growing demand for efficient, high-performance signal processing in sensor-based applications across various industries for applications such as smartphones, automotive safety (ADAS), autonomous driving, drones, robotics, security and surveillance, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), natural language processing and voice recognition, which enables us to address the transformation in devices enabled by these applications and expand our footprint and content in smartphones, drones, consumer cameras, surveillance, ADAS, voice-enabled devices and industrial IoT applications; 

Statements regarding third-party estimates of industry growth and future market conditions, including research from Bloomberg Intelligence which forecasts that hardware revenue associated with computer vision AI products and conversational AI devices will reach 61 billion and 108 billion, respectively, by 2030, indicating the size of the market opportunity; 

Our belief that our newest generation family of AI neural processing units (NPUs) present a highly efficient and high-performance architecture to enable generative and classic AI on any device including communication gateways, optically connected networks, cars, notebooks and tablets, AR/VR headsets, smartphones, and any other cloud or edge use case from the edge all the way to the cloud, and that more than 2.5 billion Edge AI devices will ship annually by 2026 based on research from Yole Group; 

Our belief that our recently announced NeuPro-Nano family of AI NPUs present a compelling position to add a cost- and power-efficient processor to microcontrollorer units and SoC designs to handle the complete AI workloads on-device, that based on research from ABI Research, by 2030, over 40 of TinyML shipments will be powered by dedicated TinyML hardware, representing billions of devices annually, and that NeuPro-Nano will allow us to expand on our strong position in IoT where we have a dominant position in wireless connectivity as customers increasingly look to add support for AI to their cost- and power-constrained chips for this market;

Table of Contents 

Our belief that our sensor fusion and spatial audio application software allows us to address an important technology piece used in personal computers, robotics, TWS earbuds, smart TVs and many other smart sensing IP products, in addition to our existing portfolio for camera-based computer vision and AI processing, and microphone-based sound processing; 

Our belief that our customers can benefit from our capabilities as a one-stop-shop for processing many types of sensors; 

Our belief that we are well positioned for long-term growth in shipments and royalty revenues derived from smart edge products as a result of our focus on silicon and software IP solutions that enable products to connect, sense and infer data; 

Our belief that our ubiquitous technology and collaborative business model present a significant and secular growth prospect as digital transformation continues to drives industries to become connected and intelligent; 

Our intention to continue to capitalize on the semiconductor momentum with our portfolio of technologies to enable three main use cases associated with smart edge devices connect, sense and infer, and to focus on four main markets which include consumer, automotive, industrial and infrastructure, and our belief that such markets are large, diversified and represent the greatest opportunities for long-term growth; 

Any statements regarding sales trends and financial results for the third and fourth quarter of and full year 2024 and other future periods, including our expectations with respect to future customers, contracts, revenues and expenses, regarding our customer pipeline, that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers in part due to consolidation in the semiconductor industry, that international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future, that an increasing portion of our new customers and revenues will be derived from international customers generally and sales to Asia Pacific in particular, that we can expand our customer base and revenues in Europe and the U.S., and that we will experience year-over-year revenue growth in 2024; 

Our belief that our cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and marketable securities, along with cash from operations, will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months; and 

Our belief that fluctuations in high interest rates within our investment portfolio will not have a material effect on our financial position on an annual or quarterly basis. 

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on information that is currently available to us and expectations and assumptions that we deem reasonable at the time the statements were made. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this report or in any of our other communications, except as required by law. All such forward-looking statements should be read as of the time the statements were made and with the recognition that these forward-looking statements may not be complete or accurate at a later date. 

Many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. These factors include, but are not limited to, those risks set forth in Part II Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

As a result of our focus on silicon and software IP solutions that enable products to connect, sense, and infer data, we believe we are well positioned for long-term growth in shipments and royalty revenues derived from smart edge products. Royalty rates from these products are comprised of a range of ASPs, spanning from high volume Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to high value sensor fusion and base station RAN. The royalty ASP of our other products will be in between the two ranges. 

CURRENT TRENDS 

We believe that with digital transformation being a long-term trend that continues drives industries to become connected and intelligent, our ubiquitous technology and collaborative business model present a significant and secular growth prospect. We intend to continue to capitalize on the semiconductor momentum with our portfolio of technologies to enable three main use cases associated with smart edge devices: connect, sense and infer. We focus on four main markets, which are consumer, automotive, industrial and infrastructure, which we believe are large, diversified and represent the greatest opportunities for long-term growth. We will also continue to serve the mobile and PC markets where we have established customers and market presence. We believe our key customers are keenly receptive to our products roadmap around connect, sense and infer, and that they are willing to expand the scope of engagements with us as our roadmap aligns with their technology needs. Furthermore, we anticipate that we can expand our customer base and revenues in Europe and the U.S., as evidenced by our geography revenue split for the second and third quarters of 2024, complementing our strong presence in the APAC region. 

We believe our strategy is returning Ceva to year-over-year revenue growth for 2024, with overall revenue now expected to grow 7 to 9 over 2023, versus the 4 to 8 we expected at the beginning of the year. This growth started in the second quarter of 2024, became more evident in the third quarter of the year, is expected to continue in the last quarter of the year. In 2024, we expect our licensing and related revenues business will continue to expand into new markets and use cases in the industrial IoT (IIoT) and consumer IoT, offering connectivity platforms, sensing platforms and software, AI solutions (including AI engines, NPUs and software) and more. On royalties, we expect our connectivity products to continue to show strength in 2024, particularly related to our Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular IoT business lines (which recorded 400 million units in the third quarter of 2024), with the initial ramp of automotive ADAS royalties expected in the fourth quarter of the year. 

Instability in the Middle East 

Our operations in Israel remain largely unaffected by the war between Israel and Hamas that began on October 7, 2023 and escalated to conflicts with Lebanon and Hezbollah, and we continue to drive our business and support our customers globally. However, a portion of our employees in Israel have been or are called to active reserve duty and additional employees may be called in the future, if needed. The Company has executed its business continuity plan with respect to those employees. It is possible that some of our operations in the region may be disrupted if this continues for a significant period of time or if the situation further deteriorates. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Total Revenues 

Total revenues were 27.2 million and 77.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, representing an increase of 13 and 6 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 was due to higher licensing and related revenues and higher royalty revenues, as further described below. The increase in total revenues for the first nine months of 2024 was due to higher royalty revenues, offset by lower licensing and related revenues, as further described below. 

Our five largest customers accounted for 48 and 44 of our total revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 53 and 30 for the comparable periods in 2023. Two customers accounted for 13 and 17 of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to three customers that accounted for 14 , 14 and 12 of our total revenues for the third quarter of 2023. One customer accounted for 13 of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to one customer that accounted for 10 of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2023. Sales to UNISOC (formerly Spreadtrum Communications, Inc. and RDA Corporation) represented 13 and 10 of our total revenues for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Generally, the identity of our customers representing 10 or more of our total revenues varies from period to period, especially with respect to our IP licensing customers as we generate licensing revenues generally from new customers on a quarterly basis. With respect to our royalty revenues, two royalty paying customers represented 10 or more of our total royalty revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, and collectively represented 43 of our total royalty revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Two royalty paying customers represented 10 or more of our total royalty revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, and collectively represented 46 and 41 of our total royalty revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers. The concentration of our customers is explainable in part by consolidation in the semiconductor industry.

Licensing and Related Revenues 

Licensing and related revenues were 15.6 million and 44.3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, representing an increase of 12 and a decrease of 3 , as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in licensing and related revenues for the third quarter of 2024 was mainly due to the signing of number of strategic deals in the third quarter of 2024 for the 5G-Advenced modem markets, including a strategic OEM customer deal for 5G-Advanced satellite communications, partially offset by a decrease from our wireless communications IP portfolio. The decrease in licensing and related revenues for the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to a decrease in our wireless communications IP portfolio, partially offset by few strategic deals for the 5G-advenced modem markets signed in the first nine months of 2024. 

During the quarter, ten IP licensing agreements were concluded, targeting a wide range of end markets and applications, including embedded AI solutions for consumer AIoT devices, 5G-Advanced satellite broadband for infrastructure and terminals, 5G for cellular IoT and V2X, spatial audio for headphones and TWS earbuds, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and UWB connectivity for wearables and hearables. Three of the deals signed in the quarter were with OEMs and three deals signed were with first-time customers. 

Licensing and related revenues accounted for 57 of our total revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to 58 and 62 for the comparable periods of 2023. 

Royalty Revenues 

Royalty revenues were 11.6 million and 33.5 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, representing an increase of 15 and 22 , as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included revenue of 0.3 million and 2.0 million, respectively, following the resolution of royalty audits. Excluding these amounts, the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 would have been up by 12 and 14 , respectively, as compared to the comparable periods of 2023. Royalty revenues accounted for 43 of our total revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to 42 and 38 for the comparable periods of 2023. The increase in royalty revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 are attributed to the continued strength in consumer and industrial IoT end markets, which helped us to achieve 15 year-over-year royalty revenue growth and delivered the second highest quarterly unit shipments in Ceva s history of 522 million units. Cellular IoT units were at an all-time record high, while Bluetooth and Wi-Fi continued to be very robust. Overall, combined shipments of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular IoT surpassed 400 million units in a quarter for the first time, an impressive milestone for our IoT connectivity product line. Moreover, we saw sequential and year-over-year growth of TVs and PCs powered by our sensor fusion software. Our customers reported sales of 522 million and 1,354 million chipsets incorporating our technologies for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, an increase of 4 and 16 from the corresponding periods in 2023 for actual shipments reported. 

The five largest royalty-paying customers accounted for 61 and 60 of our total royalty revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 60 and 55 for the comparable periods of 2023.

Due to the nature of our license agreements and the associated potential large individual contract amounts, the geographic split of revenues both in absolute dollars and percentage terms generally varies from quarter to quarter. 

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenues was 4.0 million and 9.4 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 2.4 million and 9.4 million for the comparable periods of 2023. Cost of revenues accounted for 15 and 12 of our total revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 10 and 13 for the comparable periods of 2023. The increase for the third quarter of 2024 principally reflected higher strategically beneficial customization work associated with the strategic 5G-Advanced deals we signed recently, as well as higher third-party IP costs (associated mainly with the Mobile and Infrastructure technology customers), higher revenue and the cost of unit shipments related to our sensor fusion chip business, and higher payments to the Israeli Innovation Authority of the Ministry of Economy and Industry in Israel (the IIA). Included in cost of revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was a non-cash equity-based compensation expense of 176,000 and 570,000, respectively, as compared to 216,000 and 636,000 for the comparable periods of 2023. 

Gross Margin 

Gross margin for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 85 and 88 , respectively, as compared to 90 and 87 for the comparable periods of 2023. The decrease for the third quarter of 2024 mainly reflected higher cost of revenues as set forth above, offset by higher total revenues. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 mainly reflected higher total revenues. The gross margin for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 reflects historical period on a re-cast basis excluding the Intrisix business as a discontinued operation, is also illustrative of our decision to return to pure IP licensing and royalty business model. 

Operating Expenses 

Total operating expenses were 25.9 million and 75.9 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 24.4 million and 74.5 million for the comparable periods of 2023. The net increase for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 principally reflected higher allowance for credit losses. 

Research and Development Expenses, Net 

Total research and development expenses, net were 18.0 million and 54.7 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 17.8 million and 54.5 million for the comparable periods of 2023. The slight increase for the third quarter of 2024 principally reflected higher retention costs and higher project related costs, partially offset by higher allocation of customization work for our licensees to cost of revenues. The slight increase for the first nine months of 2024 principally reflected lower research grants received, mainly from the IIA, and lower allocation of customization work for our licensees to cost of revenues, partially offset by lower project related costs. Included in research and development expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were non-cash equity-based compensation expenses of 2,421,000 and 6,866,000, respectively, as compared to 2,257,000 and 6,703,000 for the comparable periods of 2023. Research and development expenses as a percentage of our total revenues were 66 and 70 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 74 for both the comparable periods of 2023. The percentage decrease for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to the comparable periods of 2023, was mainly due to higher revenues. 

The number of research and development personnel was 326 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 322 at September 30, 2023. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Our sales and marketing expenses were 3.1 million and 9.0 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 2.9 million and 8.2 million for the comparable periods of 2023. The slight increase for the third quarter of 2024 principally reflected higher commission expenses. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 principally reflected higher commission expenses as well as higher sales training and higher marketing and trade shows events. Included in sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were non-cash equity-based compensation expenses of 491,000 and 1,307,000, respectively, as compared to 478,000 and 1,305,000 for the comparable periods of 2023. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our total revenues were 11 and 12 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 12 and 11 for the comparable periods of 2023.

The total number of sales and marketing personnel was 32 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 34 at September 30, 2023. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses were 4.6 million and 11.8 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 3.6 million and 11.3 million for the comparable periods of 2023. The increase for the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected higher allowance for credit losses and higher professional services costs. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected higher allowance for credit losses. Included in general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were non-cash equity-based compensation expenses of 1,120,000 and 2,936,000, respectively, as compared to 1,018,000 and 2,787,000 for the comparable periods of 2023. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of our total revenues were 17 and 15 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 15 for both the comparable periods of 2023. 

The number of general and administrative personnel was 45 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 51 at September 30, 2023. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets 

Our amortization charges were 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the comparable periods of 2023. The amortization charges for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were incurred in connection with the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of the Hillcrest Labs and VisiSonics business.

Financial income, net, consists of interest earned on investments, gains and losses from sale of marketable securities, accretion (amortization) of discounts (premiums) on marketable securities and foreign exchange movements. 

The increase in interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities, net, during both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 principally reflected higher combined bank deposits and marketable securities balances held (mainly because of cash received from the sale of Intrinsix in October 2023) and higher yields. 

We review our monthly expected major non-U.S. dollar denominated expenditures and look to hold equivalent non-U.S. dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations. However, our Euro cash balances increase significantly on a quarterly basis beyond our Euro liabilities, mainly from applicable French research tax credits, which are generally refunded every three years. This has resulted in a foreign exchange gain of 0.80 million and 0.52 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to foreign exchange gain of 0.03 million and 0.39 million for the comparable periods of 2023. 

Remeasurement of Marketable Equity Securities 

We recorded an income of 21,000 and a loss of 97,000 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to an income of 160,000 and a loss of 76,000 for the comparable periods of 2023, related to remeasurement of marketable equity securities, which we hold at cost. Over time, other income (expense), net, may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. Equity values generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of marketable equity securities. In addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant change in the value of our investments.

Provision for Income Taxes 

Our income tax expenses was 1.0 million and 4.3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 1.1 million and 3.1 million for the comparable periods of 2023. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected higher withholding tax expenses in our Israeli subsidiary for which we will not be able to obtain a refund from the tax authorities and the effect of the capitalization of R D expenditures under IRC Section 174, partially offset by lower tax expenses on income generated in our French subsidiary (under the French IP Box regime). 

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A number of factors influence our effective tax rate, including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules. Federal, state, and local governments and administrative bodies within the United States, and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, a variety of broad tax, trade, and other regulatory reforms that may impact us. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Reform enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes, and the taxation of foreign earnings. It is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes, but these changes could have a material impact on our business and financial condition. 

We have significant operations in Israel and operations in France and the Republic of Ireland. A substantial portion of our taxable income is generated in Israel and France, as well as potentially in the U.S. due to global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and the requirement to capitalize R D expenditures under IRC Section 174 over 5 years if sourced from the U.S. and over 15 years if sourced internationally. Although our Israeli and Irish subsidiaries, and, from 2022 onward, our French subsidiary, are taxed at rates substantially lower than U.S. tax rates, the tax rates in these jurisdictions could nevertheless result in a substantial increase as a result of withholding tax expenses with respect to which we are unable to obtain a refund from the relevant tax authorities. 

Our Irish subsidiary qualified for a 12.5 tax rate on its trade. Interest income generated by our Irish subsidiary is taxed at a rate of 25 . 

Our French subsidiary is entitled to a tax benefit of 10 applied to specific revenues under the French IP Box regime. The French IP Box regime applies to net income derived from the licensing, sublicensing or sale of several IP rights such as patents and copyrighted software, including royalty revenues. This elective regime requires a direct link between the income benefiting from the preferential treatment and the R D expenditures incurred and contributing to that income. Qualifying income may be taxed at a favorable 10 CIT rate (plus social surtax, hence 10.3 in total). 

Our Israeli subsidiary is entitled to various tax benefits as a technological enterprise. In December 2016, the Economic Efficiency Law (Legislative Amendments for Applying the Economic Policy for the 2017 and 2018 Budget Years), 2016, which includes the Amendment to the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 (Amendment 73) (the Amendment ), was published. The Amendment, among other things, prescribes special tax tracks for technological enterprises, which are subject to rules that were issued by the Minister of Finance in April 2017. 

The new tax track under the Amendment, which is applicable to our Israeli subsidiary, is the Technological Preferred Enterprise . Technological Preferred Enterprise is an enterprise for which total consolidated revenues of its parent company and all subsidiaries are less than 10 billion New Israeli Shekel (NIS). A Technological Preferred Enterprise, as defined in the Amendment, that is located in the center of Israel (where our Israeli subsidiary is currently located), is taxed at a rate of 12 on profits deriving from intellectual property. Any dividends distributed to foreign companies , as defined in the Amendment, deriving from income from technological enterprises will be taxed at a rate of 4 . We are applying the Technological Preferred Enterprise tax track for our Israeli subsidiary from tax year 2020 and onwards. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 

33

Table of Contents 

We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, fair value of financial instruments, equity-based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024, for a discussion of additional critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to what was previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 13.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, 2.0 million in bank deposits, and 142.9 million in marketable securities, totaling 158.1 million, as compared to 166.5 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease for the first nine months of 2024 principally reflected cash used in operating activities and funds used to repurchase 343,604 shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of approximately 7.5 million, partially offset by cash proceeds from exercise of stock-based awards. 

Out of total cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits and marketable securities of 158.1 million, 133.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to permanently reinvest earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign earnings to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds. The determination of the amount of additional taxes related to the repatriation of these earnings is not practicable, as it may vary based on various factors such as the location of the cash and the effect of regulation in the various jurisdictions from which the cash would be repatriated. 

During the first nine months of 2024, we invested 41.3 million of cash in marketable securities with maturities up to 30 months from the balance sheet date. In addition, during the same period, marketable securities were sold or redeemed for cash amounting to 34.4 million. All of our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. The purchase and sale or redemption of available-for-sale marketable securities are considered part of investing cash flow. Available-for-sale marketable securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity, net of taxes. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments, as determined on a specific identification basis, are included in the interim condensed consolidated statements of loss. The amount of credit losses recorded for the first nine months of 2024 was immaterial. For more information about our marketable securities, see Note 7 to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Bank deposits are classified as short-term bank deposits and long-term bank deposits. Short-term bank deposits are deposits with maturities of more than three months but no longer than one year from the balance sheet date, whereas long-term bank deposits are deposits with maturities of more than one year as of the balance sheet date. Bank deposits are presented at their cost, including accrued interest, and purchases and sales are considered part of cash flows from investing activities. 

Operating Activities 

Cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 4.6 million and consisted of net loss of 7.0 million, adjustments for non-cash items of 13.6 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 11.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of 3.0 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, and 11.7 million of equity-based compensation expenses, partially offset by 0.7 million of amortization of premiums on available-for-sale marketable securities and 0.5 million of unrealized foreign exchange gain. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an increase in trade receivables of 7.8 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 3.7 million (mainly related to unbilled receivables of 2.7 million classified as other long-term assets in the Interim Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets). 

Cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2023 was 11.1 million and consisted of net loss of 15.6 million, adjustments for non-cash items of 16.1 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 11.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of 3.9 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (including 1.1 million from discontinued operations), and 12.3 million of equity-based compensation expenses. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of an increase in trade receivables of 0.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 2.0 million (mainly as a result of an increase in applicable French research tax credits), an increase in deferred taxes, net of 1.5 million, a decrease in trade payables of 0.8 million, a decrease in accrued payroll and related benefits of 6.2 million (mainly as a result of a yearly bonus payments), and a decrease of income tax payable of 1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenues of 1.0 million.

Table of Contents 

Cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our receipts and payments. Our ongoing cash outflows from operating activities principally relate to payroll-related costs and obligations under our property leases and design tool licenses. Our primary sources of cash inflows are receipts from our accounts receivable, to some extent, funding from research and development government grants and French research tax credits, and interest earned from our cash, deposits and marketable securities. The timing of receipts of accounts receivable from customers is based upon the completion of agreed milestones or agreed dates as set out in the contracts. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 1.1 million, compared to 7.2 million of net cash provided by investing activities for the comparable period of 2023. We had a cash outflow of 41.3 million and a cash inflow of 34.4 million with respect to investments in marketable securities during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to a cash outflow of 10.5 million and a cash inflow of 19.5 million with respect to investments in marketable securities during the first nine months of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, we had net proceeds of 8.0 million from bank deposits, as compared to net proceeds of 4.0 million from bank deposits for the comparable period of 2023. We had a cash outflow of 1.9 million and 2.1 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, from purchase of property and equipment. For the first nine months of 2024, we had a cash inflow of 0.5 million in connection with the sale of Intrinsix, and a cash outflow of 0.8 million for the acquisition of a Greek-based company. For the first nine months of 2023, we had a cash outflow of 3.6 million for the acquisition of the VisiSonics business. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 was 4.6 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in the amount of 0.4 million for the comparable period of 2023. 

In August 2008, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to one million shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, which was extended by an additional 7,800,000 shares collectively across further approvals in 2010, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2023 and November 2024. During the first nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 343,604 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 21.70 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 7,456. During the first nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 135,078 shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 22.23 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 3,003. As of September 30, 2024, we had 356,396 shares available for repurchase, with 700,000 additional shares being approved by our board of directors for repurchase on November 7, 2024, bringing the aggregate to approximately 1,056,000 shares available for repurchase as of that date. 

During the first nine months of 2024, we received 2.9 million from the exercise of stock-based awards, as compared to 3.4 million received for the comparable period of 2023. 

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and marketable securities, along with cash from operations, will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We cannot provide assurances, however, that the underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will prove to be accurate. 

In addition, as part of our business strategy, we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies and minority equity investments. Accordingly, a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses or minority equity investments. Such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, complete acquisitions or investments, integrate acquired businesses into our current operations, or expand into new markets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurances that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

Item 3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

A majority of our revenues and a portion of our expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars and our assets and liabilities together with our cash holdings are predominately denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the majority of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the NIS and the Euro. Increases in volatility of the exchange rates of currencies other than the U.S. dollar versus the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur when remeasured into U.S. dollars. We review our monthly expected non-U.S. dollar denominated expenditures and look to hold equivalent non-U.S. dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations. However, our Euro cash balances increase significantly on a quarterly basis beyond our Euro liabilities, mainly from French research tax benefits applicable to the CIR, which is generally refunded every three years. This has resulted in a foreign exchange gain of 802,000 and 523,000 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and a foreign exchange gain of 34,000 and 390,000 for the comparable periods of 2023. 

35

Table of Contents 

As a result of currency fluctuations and the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar denominated expenditures to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and quarterly basis. To protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flow resulting from salaries paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar during the year, we follow a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. We hedge portions of the anticipated payroll for our non-U.S. employees denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for a period of one to twelve months with forward and option contracts. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss of 20,000 and 966,000, respectively, from our forward and option contracts, net of taxes, with respect to anticipated payroll expenses for our non-U.S. employees. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss of 77,000 and 132,000, respectively, from our forward and option contracts, net of taxes, with respect to anticipated payroll expenses for our non-U.S. employees. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of other comprehensive gain from our forward and option contracts, net of taxes, was 22,000, which will be recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) during the following one month. We recognized a net gain of 160,000 and 767,000 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and a net loss of 299,000 and 873,000 for the comparable periods of 2023, related to forward and options contracts. We note that hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations. We expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate and currency fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis. 

The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in high-grade certificates of deposits with major U.S., European and Israeli banks. Generally, cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits may be redeemed and therefore minimal credit risk exists with respect to them. Nonetheless, deposits with these banks exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions, to the extent such deposits are even insured in such foreign jurisdictions. While we monitor on a systematic basis the cash and cash equivalent balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit our funds fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, we have experienced no loss of principal or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be affected if the financial institutions that we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail. 

We hold an investment portfolio consisting principally of corporate bonds. We have the ability to hold such investments until recovery of temporary declines in market value or maturity. As of September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with our investments were approximately 1.1 million due to the dramatic changes in the interest rate environment that took place in 2022. As we tend to hold such bonds with unrealized losses to recovery, the allowance for credit losses was not material during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. However, we can provide no assurance that we will recover present declines in the market value of our investments. 

Interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities, net, were 1.50 million and 4.44 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 0.89 million and 3.11 million for the comparable periods of 2023. The increase in interest income, and gains and losses from marketable securities, net, during both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 reflected higher combined bank deposits and marketable securities balances held (mainly because of cash received from the sale of Intrinsix in October 2023) and higher yields. 

We are exposed primarily to fluctuations in the level of U.S. interest rates. To the extent that interest rates rise, fixed interest investments may be adversely impacted, whereas a decline in interest rates may decrease the anticipated interest income for variable rate investments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short-term. We currently do not have any derivative instruments but may put them in place in the future. Fluctuations in interest rates within our investment portfolio have not had, and we do not currently anticipate such fluctuations will have, a material effect on our financial position on an annual or quarterly basis. 

Item 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
