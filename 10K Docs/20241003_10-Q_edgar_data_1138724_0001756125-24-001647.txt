The Company was to pay , of which has already been paid, and issue common shares to purchase these assets under this first amended APA. GES derives over of its current business from Election Services Solutions. Management anticipates the closing of this transaction will occur in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 On May 20, 2015, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned entity in the State of Delaware called GAHI Acquisition Corp. This entity was incorporated at the time to be the merger subsidiary for the acquisition of Blockchain Technologies Corp. (BTC) and other software system development. 
 
 On May 20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with BTC. Under this agreement, BTC would have merged with GAHI Acquisition, and GAHI Acquisition, would have been the surviving corporation. As consideration for the merger, the Company was to reserve a number of shares equal to 1/3 the total issued and outstanding of the Company to be issued to BTC shareholders at closing. On October 20, 2015, the parties agreed to extend the closing date of the merger to December 15, 2015. This agreement expired on December 15, 2015. 

Concurrently, on October 20, 2015, the Company paid in cash to BTC and issued to Nikolaos Spanos of its common shares and warrants to purchase its common shares at the exercise price of per common share with an exercise period of . The warrants have expired. The common shares and warrants were issued for the purchase of common shares of BTC. Said common shares of BTC represented ten percent of the outstanding equity in BTC on October 20, 2015.

There has been no further activity in GAHI Acquisition Corp. 
 
 On March 28, 2017, the United States Patent Office issued patents to BTC covering Election Intellectual Property, US Patent #9,608,829, Issued March 28, 2017. As an equity shareholder in BTC only, GAHC and GES have not used the BTC US Patent. Any use of the patent would require a new negotiation, and new contract with BTC. 
 
 The Company has determined that the initial investment of Blockchain Technologies Corp. will be written off. The Company s Board of Directors cancelled all transactions previously proposed but never acted on concerning GAHI Acquisition. GAHI Acquisition will remain a subsidiary for the exclusive use of any future transactions involving Blockchain Technologies Corporation. 
 
 The Company, GAHI, and GES do not trade crypto currency, nor participate in Initial Coin Offerings. 
 
 On June 15, 2019, GES entered into a Term Sheet, and Common Stock Purchase Agreement to create a joint venture with TrueVote, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement GES was to invest into a 24 Month Debenture and issue a warrant exercisable at for common shares of the Company.

The Company invested into Tidewater Energy Group Inc. for general capital and administrative expenses in January 2020. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has generated recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficits from its operations since inception and has had to continually borrow to continue operating. In addition, certain of the Company s debt is in default as of June 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or acquire or develop a business that generates sufficient positive cash flows from operations. The Company continues to raise funds from the issuance of additional convertible promissory note. Management is hopeful that with their ability to raise additional funds that the Company should be able to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, expectations, predictions, and assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical facts. Although the Company believes such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that any forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Such forward-looking statements are subject to, and are qualified by, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the Company s ability to estimate the impact of competition and of industry consolidation and risks, uncertainties and other factors set forth in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q. Current GES Corporate Operations GES has developed and deployed proprietary Registration software, which was designed specifically to authenticate and register voters. This proprietary software functions as a data storage and retrieval registration system by cross-referencing eligibility status within a control voter database. In a mail ballot election, the voter s ID barcode, QR code, or signature on the Business Reply Envelope, can be scanned and the status of that voter is identified. If the voter is not eligible to vote or another ballot for that individual has already been registered in the system, that ballot is marked VOID and removed from the count. In an in-person election, the voter provides their name for look-up in the system. If they have not voted, a signature box pops up on the screen, the voter signs an electronic signature pad and the digital signature is captured next to their name. If a voter tries to vote more than once, an alert will pop up indicating that the voter has already registered, and the voter will not receive an additional ballot. Because we account for every single ballot, the system has multiple reporting options, which include the list of valid envelopes and list of voters whose ballot was void, detailing the reason. Once the voter is authenticated, the identifiers are removed to ensure a secret vote and the ballot is scanned for tabulation. GES developed proprietary Scanning and Tabulation election software. This software features advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode scanning and tabulation system featuring de-skewing, de-speckling and image correction. The computer hardware was designed to run hard wired without Internet or Wi-Fi access, ensuring complete security. The system allows for triple-auditing capabilities, which are; electronically generated tabulation results, .jpeg imaging and storage, and the original physical ballot. This advancement gives GES the ability to tabulate elections faster and more efficiently. As experts in paper/mail ballot elections, GES began deploying this system in our elections in the third quarter of 2017 and it has been operating flawlessly. In 2020 GES developed, built and implemented a propriety online election voting solution that is compliant with Title IV of the United States Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards. GES built the platform on one of the most secure global infrastructures Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is a comprehensive, evolving platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform as a service and packaged software (PaaS), and software as a service offerings (SaaS). The platform enables GES to protect individual client data, including the ability to encrypt it, move it, and manage retention (if required). All data flowing across the global network interconnects with the GES secured data center and is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities. Additional encryption layers exist as well. 31 GES controls where our client data is stored, who can access it, and what resources your organization is utilizing at any given moment. Fine-grain identity and access controls combined with continuous monitoring for near real-time security information ensures that the right resources have the right access at all times, wherever your information is stored. GES encryption software uses AES 256 with a cryptographic key using an RSA elliptic curve of 4096, which is used to encrypt the communication of the client and the GES server, as well all client data hosted in the server. A six-digit security code, delivered to the voter s email address provided by the client, must be validated by the prospective voter in order to authenticate the identity of the voter before the voter may access the ballot. After validating the voter, the voter then votes anonymously, so that the identity of the voter and the ballot cast can never be matched. The GES voting platform verifies that the users does not use the back and forward browser button, a safe mechanism against tampering. Distributed denial of service DDoS protection tools help secure websites and applications and prevent DDoS attacks, which bombard websites with traffic traditionally delivered via botnets" that are created by networked endpoints connected via malware. The DDoS software protection provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency. Every state has Election Software Developers and Manufactures may also qualify by meeting individual requirements for individual States in the United States. GES has begun undertaking the following six step benchmarks to qualify for the updated U.S. certification and is also considering individual State certifications; Step 1 - Voting System Testing, Testing current developed systems to U.S. Federal 2.0 Standards Step 2 - Technical Data Package Review; Reviews submitted documents against documentation requirements of outside agencies, published standards, or U.S. specifications Step 3 - Physical Configuration Audit; Examines the documentation of the system against the actual submitted system Step 4 - System Integration Testing; Executes tests on all components of a system configured as if the system was deployed Step 5 - Functional Configuration Audit; Examines submitted test data and conducts additional testing to verify submitted system hardware and software described in the documents submitted to the Elections Assistance Commission and the Department of Homeland Security Step 6 - Security Testing; Performs vulnerability assessments and penetration analysis to assess system vulnerabilities Trends and Uncertainties The Company currently has minimal revenues and operations and is investigating potential businesses and companies for acquisition to create and/or acquire a sustainable business. Our ability to acquire or create a sustainable business may be adversely affected by our current financial conditions, availability of capital and/ or loans, general economic conditions which can be cyclical in nature along with prolonged recessionary periods, and other economic and political situations. The Company has generated recurring losses and cash flow deficits from its operations since inception and has had to continually borrow to continue operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. Management believes that it will be successful in obtaining additional financing, from which the proceeds will be primarily used to execute its new operating plans. The Company plans to use its available cash and new financing to develop and execute its new business plan and hopefully create and maintain a self-sustaining business. However, the Company can give no assurances that it will be successful in achieving its plans or if financing will be available or, if available, on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, and ultimately achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or all of its operating activities. 32 There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from our continuing operations except for the fair value change on derivative financial instruments and settlement on arbitration. The rapid advances in computing and telecommunications technology over the past several decades have brought with them increasingly sophisticated methods of delivering administrating elections. Along with these advances, though, have come risks regarding the integrity and privacy of data, and these risks apply to election companies, falling into the general classification of cybersecurity. While it is not possible for anyone to give an absolute guarantee that data will not be compromised, when applicable, the Company shall utilize third-party service providers to secure the Company s financial and personal data; the Company believes that third-party service providers provide reasonable assurance that the financial and personal data that they hold are secure. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 32,786,305 and a working capital deficit of 9,881,535. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends upon whether we can ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations, and obtain additional financing as needed. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded net loss of 287,997. We recorded an amortization of debt discount of 61,432 and a gain from change in fair value of derivative liability of 3,611. We had an increase in accrued expenses of 131,279. As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of 101,675 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, we received 139,500 as proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes payable, 217,500 as proceeds from the issuance of promissory notes payable, repaid 109,420 of outstanding convertible promissory notes payable and repaid 137,061 of promissory notes payable. As a result, we had net cash provided by financing activities of 110,519 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded net loss of 825,042.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were 348,190 compared to 237,972 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, an increase of 110,218. The majority of our clients hold elections on a three year cycle. This increase in revenues is due primarily to less elections held during the three month period in 2023. Salaries and benefits totaled 32,032 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 69,432 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was due to the employment compensation amended for John Matthews and Kathryn Weisbeck since the 2nd quarter of 2023 and reduced the salary to 2 per quarter per person. Professional fees for the three months ended June 30, 2024 totaled 101,077 compared to 131,738 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of 32,798. This decrease is primarily due to decreased assistance needed during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 33 For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred marketing and advertising expenses of 42,344 compared to 25,216 in the three months ended June 30, 2023.

The increase in printing expenses was mainly due to a increase in costs related to the increase in revenue. Total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were 527,456, compared to 641,512 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of 114,056 principally due to reasons discussed above. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not Applicable Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of June 30, 2024. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be not effective as of June 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 34 Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or those persons performing similar functions, did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Important Considerations The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. 35 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company may be involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance.
