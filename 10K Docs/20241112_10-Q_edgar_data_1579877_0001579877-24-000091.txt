 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired displays, resulting in amortizable intangible assets for permits and leasehold agreements of million, which are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, an average period of years.

 As a result of negative aggregate cash flow forecasts related to our New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the MTA asset group, we performed quarterly impairment analyses on the MTA asset group during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and recorded impairment charges of million and million, respectively, in those periods for a total of million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charges recorded during 2024 represented additional MTA equipment deployment cost spending during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our analysis performed as of September 30, 2024, resulted in positive aggregate cash flows in excess of the carrying value of our MTA asset group. As such, impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of million representing additional MTA equipment deployment costs spending during the quarter, and in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of million, primarily representing million of impairment charges related to our MTA asset group.

 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have a million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the AR Facility ), which terminates in June 2027, unless further extended. 
 
 On June 14, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the agreements governing the AR Facility, pursuant to which we (i) extended the term of the AR Facility so that it now terminates on June 14, 2027, unless further extended; and (ii) modified the upfront fee and modified the program fee so that the program fee may increase or decrease based on the Company s Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined and described below). The amendment to the agreements governing the AR Facility do not change how we account for the AR Facility as a collateralized financing activity. 
 
 In connection with the AR Facility, Outfront Media LLC and Outfront Media Outernet Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain of the Company s taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs (the Originators ), will sell and/or contribute their respective existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to either Outfront Media Receivables LLC, a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company s qualified REIT subsidiary accounts receivable assets (the QRS SPV or Outfront Media Receivables TRS, LLC a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company s TRS accounts receivable assets (the TRS SPV and together with the QRS SPV, the SPVs ). The SPVs may transfer undivided interests in their respective accounts receivable assets to certain purchasers from time to time (the Purchasers ). The SPVs are separate legal entities with their own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPVs assets before the assets become available to the Company. Accordingly, the SPVs assets are not available to pay creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers and other creditors of the SPVs may be remitted to the Company. Outfront Media LLC will service the accounts receivables on behalf of the SPVs for a fee.

 Recoupment of Equipment Deployment Costs. We may retain incremental revenues that exceed an annual base revenue amount for the cost of deploying advertising and communications displays throughout the transit system. As presented in the table below, recoupable MTA equipment deployment costs are recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and as these costs are recouped from incremental revenues that the MTA would otherwise be entitled to receive, Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs will be reduced. If incremental revenues generated over the term of the agreement are not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the equipment deployment costs, the costs will not be recouped, which could have an adverse effect on our

We did not recoup any equipment deployment costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we do not expect to recoup any equipment deployment costs in the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Payments . We must pay to the MTA the greater of a percentage of revenues or a guaranteed minimum annual payment. Our payment obligations with respect to guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts owed to the MTA resumed on January 1, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the MTA Agreement, and any guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts that would have been paid for the period from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (less any revenue share amounts actually paid during this period using an increased revenue share percentage of will instead be added in equal increments to the guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts owed for the period from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2026. The MTA Agreement also provides that if prior to April 1, 2028 the balance of unrecovered costs of deploying advertising and communications screens throughout the transit system is equal to or less than , then in any year following the year in which such recoupment occurs (the Recoupment Year ), the MTA is entitled to receive an additional payment equal to of the annual base revenue amount for such year calculated in accordance with the MTA Agreement, provided that gross revenues in such year (i) were at least equal to the gross revenues generated in the Recoupment Year, and (ii) did not decline by more than from the prior year. 
 
 Term . In July 2021, we extended the initial -year term of the MTA Agreement to a -year base term (the Amended Term ). We have the option to extend the Amended Term for an additional period at the end of the Amended Term, subject to satisfying certain quantitative and qualitative conditions. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had recoupment from incremental revenues. As of September 30, 2024, digital displays had been installed, composed of digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock and MTA communications displays. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, installations occurred, for a total of installations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 As a result of negative aggregate cash flow forecasts related to our MTA asset group, we performed quarterly impairment analyses on the MTA asset group during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and recorded impairment charges of million and million, respectively, in those periods for a total of million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charges recorded during 2024 represented additional MTA equipment deployment cost spending during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our analysis performed as of September 30, 2024, resulted in positive aggregate cash flows in excess of the carrying value of our MTA asset group. As such, impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 22, 2024, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This MD A contains forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are subject to a number of important factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, and the section entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described herein or implied by such forward-looking statements . Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to (i) OUTFRONT Media, the Company, we, our, us and our company mean OUTFRONT Media Inc., a Maryland corporation, and unless the context requires otherwise, its consolidated subsidiaries, and (ii) the 25 largest markets in the U.S., approximately 120 markets in the U.S. and Nielsen Designated Market Areas are based, in whole or in part, on Nielsen Media Research s 2024 Designated Market Area rankings. 

Overview 
 
 OUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust REIT ), which provides advertising space displays on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the U.S. ). We currently manage our operations through one operating segment, U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment. Prior to its sale, our Canadian operations comprised our International operating segment, which did not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, was included in Other . Historical operating results of our Canadian operations are included in Other (see Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements) through the date of sale. 
 
 On June 7, 2024, we sold all of our equity interests in Outdoor Systems Americas ULC and its subsidiaries (the Transaction ), which hold all of the assets of the Company s outdoor advertising business in Canada (the Canadian Business ). (See Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions : Dispositions : Canadian Business to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 
 
 Business 
 
 We are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas DMAs ), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and approximately 120 markets in the U.S. Our top market, high-profile, location-focused portfolio includes sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser s website or retail location one mile down the road. 
 
 In addition to providing location-based displays, we also focus on delivering mass and targeted audiences to our customers. Geopath, the out-of-home advertising industry s audience measurement system, enables us to build campaigns based on the size and demographic composition of audiences. As part of our technology platform, we are developing solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. 
 
 We believe out-of-home continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective stand-alone medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, consumer insights, print production, creative services and post-campaign tracking and analytics. 
 
 Economic Environment 
 
 Our revenues and operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in advertising expenditures, general economic conditions and other external events beyond our control, such as supply chain disruptions, current levels of inflation, pandemics like the 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 COVID-19 pandemic, industry shutdowns or slowdowns (including due to labor strikes), and shifts in market demographics and transportation patterns (including reductions in foot traffic, roadway traffic, commuting, transit ridership and overall target audiences due to remote work, safety concerns or otherwise), as described in this MD A. These sensitivities may adversely impact our revenues and operating results on a consolidated basis and/or may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our U.S. transit business within our U.S. Media reportable segment. 
 
 We rely on third parties to manufacture and transport our digital displays. As a result of the current market-wide supply shortages and logistics disruptions, we have experienced delays and price increases with respect to certain of our digital displays, which may continue throughout 2024, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Due to the current levels of inflation and commodity prices in the U.S. and abroad, which has resulted in elevated interest rates, we have experienced increases with respect to some of our posting, maintenance and other expenses, some of our corporate expenses, and our interest expense, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our billboard property lease expenses and transit franchise expenses have been less impacted by the current levels of inflation due to the long-term nature of most of our operating leases and transit franchise agreements. However, our transit franchise agreements that contain inflationary price adjustments may cause increases in our transit franchise expenses in the near-term. Though the Company cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of the current levels of inflation on our business, financial condition and results of operations at this time, a portion of these increases may be partially offset by increases in advertising rates on our displays and cost efficiencies. 
 
 Business Environment 
 
 The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several companies operating on a national basis, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for both customers and structure and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional advertising platforms (such as television, radio, print and direct mail marketers). In addition, we compete with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. 
 
 Increasing the number of digital displays in our prime audience locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce print production and installation costs. In addition, digital displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display. Digital billboard displays generate approximately four to five times more revenue per display on average than comparable traditional static billboard displays. Digital billboard displays also incur, on average, approximately two to four times more costs, including higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue than comparable traditional static billboard displays. As a result, digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than comparable traditional static billboard displays. 
 
 We have deployed state-of-the-art digital transit displays in connection with several transit franchises we operate and we expect to continue these deployments over the coming years, but at a slower pace than our historical deployments. We believe revenues generated on our network of digital transit displays will be higher than revenues generated on a comparable portfolio of our static transit displays. 
 
 We have incurred, and we intend to incur, significant equipment deployment costs and capital expenditures, in the coming years to continue increasing the number of digital displays in our portfolio. However, we expect our annual equipment deployment cost spending with respect to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the MTA transit franchise will decline now that we have substantially completed our initial deployment during 2024.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we built or converted 65 new digital billboard displays in the U.S. and entered into marketing arrangements to sell advertising on 14 third-party digital billboard displays in the U.S. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we built, converted or replaced 5,717 digital transit and other displays in the U.S. The following table sets forth information regarding our digital displays.

 (a) Digital display amounts include 5,867 displays reserved for transit agency use. Our number of digital displays is impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, management agreements, the net effect of new and lost billboards, and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period. 
 (b) On June 7, 2024, we completed the sale of the Canadian Business in the Transaction. (See Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation and Note 12. Acquisitions and Dispositions : Dispositions : Canadian Business to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 
 
 Our revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season. As described above, our revenues and profits may also fluctuate due to external events beyond our control. 
 
 We have a diversified base of customers across various industries. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our largest categories of advertisers were entertainment, retail and health/medical, each of which represented approximately 18 , 12 and 8 of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, our largest categories of advertisers were entertainment, retail and health/medical, each of which represented approximately 19 , 11 and 9 of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our largest categories of advertisers were entertainment, retail and health/medical, each of which represented approximately 18 , 11 and 9 of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our largest categories of advertisers were entertainment, retail and health/medical, each of which represented approximately 20 , 10 and 9 of our total U.S. Media segment revenues, respectively. 
 
 Our large-scale portfolio allows our customers to reach a national audience and also provides the flexibility to tailor campaigns to specific regions or markets. We generated approximately 42 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 43 in the same prior-year period. We generated approximately 41 of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 42 in the same prior-year period. 
 
 Our transit businesses require us to periodically obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain or renew contracts. 

Key Performance Indicators 
 
 Our management reviews our performance by focusing on the indicators described below. 
 
 Several of our key performance indicators are not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America GAAP ). We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

 (a) Organic revenues exclude revenues associated with the impact of the Transaction and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates non-organic revenues ). We provide organic revenues to understand the underlying growth rate of revenue excluding the impact of non-organic revenue items. Our management believes organic revenues are useful to users of our financial data because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business period to period. Since organic revenues are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, revenues as an indicator of operating performance. Organic revenues, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Analysis of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We derive Revenues primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year. Revenues from billboard displays are recognized as rental income on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Transit and other revenues are recognized over the contract period. (See Note 11. Revenues to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

 Billboard property lease expenses represented 33 of billboard revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 34 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in billboard property lease expenses as a percentage of billboard revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to lower variable billboard property lease costs driven by higher revenue performance in advertising markets that have lower variable billboard property lease costs and lower revenue performance in advertising markets that have higher variable billboard property lease costs, partially offset by the impact of new locations, including through acquisitions. Billboard property lease expenses represented 34 of billboard revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 35 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in billboard property lease expenses as a percentage of billboard revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to lower variable billboard property lease costs driven by higher revenue performance in advertising markets that have lower variable billboard property lease costs and lower revenue performance in advertising markets that have higher variable billboard property lease costs (see Note 5. Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the impact of new locations, including through acquisitions. 
 
 Transit franchise expenses represented 73 of transit display revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024, 73 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, 72 of transit display revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 76 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in transit franchise expenses, as a percentage of transit display revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, was primarily driven by MTA revenues growing at a faster pace than the inflationary increase to the guaranteed minimum annual payments to the MTA under the MTA Agreement (as defined below), partially offset by the net impact of new and lost transit franchise contracts. 
 
 Billboard property lease and transit franchise expenses decreased 5.3 million, or 3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to the impact of the Transaction, lower variable property lease expenses and the net impact of new and lost transit franchise contracts, partially offset by higher guaranteed minimum annual payments to the MTA and the impact of new locations, including through acquisitions.

 franchise expenses decreased 6.8 million, or 1 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to lower variable property lease expenses, the impact of the Transaction and the net impact of new and lost transit franchise contracts, partially offset by higher guaranteed minimum annual payments to the MTA and the impact of new locations, including through acquisitions. 
 
 Posting, maintenance and other expenses as a percentage of revenues were 12 in each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 13 in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Posting, maintenance and other expenses decreased 1.4 million, or 2 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to the impact of the Transaction and lower materials costs driven by lower third-party equipment sales, partially offset by higher compensation-related expenses and higher posting and rotation costs, driven by higher business activity. Posting, maintenance and other expenses increased 2.4 million, or 1 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses, higher posting and rotation costs, driven by higher business activity, and higher maintenance and utilities cost, driven by inflationary cost increases, partially offset by the impact of the Transaction and lower materials costs driven by lower third-party equipment sales. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG A 
 
 SG A expenses represented 24 of Revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024, 23 of Revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2023, 25 of Revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 24 of Revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. SG A expenses increased 3.4 million, or 3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses, including salaries and commissions, the impact of market fluctuations on an unfunded equity-linked retirement plan offered by the Company to certain employees and higher professional fees, as a result of a management consulting project, partially offset by the impact of the Transaction and a lower provision for doubtful accounts. SG A expenses increased 16.5 million, or 5 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses, including salaries and commissions, higher professional fees, as a result of a management consulting project, the impact of market fluctuations on an unfunded equity-linked retirement plan offered by the Company to certain employees and higher rent related to new offices, partially offset by the impact of the Transaction. We continue to evaluate methods to lower SG A expense growth. 
 
 Net (Gain) Loss on Dispositions 
 
 Net loss on dispositions was 1.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net gain on dispositions was 153.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a Net loss on dispositions of 0.2 million in the same prior-year period, due primarily to the impact of the Transaction. 
 
 Impairment Charges 
 
 As a result of negative aggregate cash flow forecasts related to our MTA asset group, we performed quarterly impairment analyses on the MTA asset group during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and recorded impairment charges of 9.1 million and 8.8 million, respectively, in those periods for a total of 17.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charges recorded during 2024 represented additional MTA equipment deployment cost spending during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our analysis performed as of September 30, 2024, resulted in positive aggregate cash flows in excess of the carrying value of our MTA asset group. As such, no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 12.1 million, representing additional MTA equipment deployment costs spending during the quarter, and in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 523.5 million, primarily representing 455.2 million of impairment charges related to our MTA asset group (see Note 4. Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and an impairment charge of 47.6 million representing the entire goodwill balance associated with our U.S. Transit and Other reporting unit. 
 
 In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of 0.3 million related to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of a cost-method investment. 
 
 Depreciation 
 
 Depreciation decreased 0.7 million, or 4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, and decreased 3.6 million, or 6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to the impact of the Transaction (see Note 12.

 Interest expense, net, was 37.1 million (including 1.5 million of deferred financing costs) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 40.2 million (including 1.6 million of deferred financing costs) in the same prior-year period. Interest expense, net, decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to a lower average debt balance, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest expense, net, was 119.6 million (including 4.6 million of deferred financing costs) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 117.6 million (including 5.0 million of deferred financing costs) in the same prior-year period. Interest expense, net, increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by a lower average debt balance. 
 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.2 million, relating to the write-off of deferred financing costs and a portion of the discount on the Term Loan (as defined below), due to prepayments on the Term Loan. 
 
 Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes 
 
 Benefit for income taxes was 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a Provision for income taxes of 1.4 million in the same prior-year period, due primarily to the impact of the Transaction. Provision for income taxes increased 8.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to a gain on disposition related to the Transaction. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 
 Net income before allocation to redeemable and non-redeemable noncontrolling interests increased 18.1 million, or 108 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily driven by higher operating income, impairment charges incurred in 2023 and lower interest expense. Net income before allocation to redeemable and non-redeemable noncontrolling interests was 184.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared a Net loss before allocation to redeemable and non-redeemable noncontrolling interests of 485.2 million in the same prior-year period, primarily driven by higher operating income, due primarily to a gain on disposition related to the Transaction and higher impairment charges incurred in 2023, partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and higher interest expense. 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted OIBDA 
 
 We calculate Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization, net (gain) loss on dispositions, stock-based compensation and impairment charges. We calculate Adjusted OIBDA margin by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are among the primary measures we use for managing our business, evaluating our operating performance and planning and forecasting future periods, as each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because eliminating certain non-comparable items highlight operational trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management s opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier for users of our financial data to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.

 FFO and AFFO 
 
 When used herein, references to FFO and AFFO mean FFO attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc. and AFFO attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc., respectively. We calculate FFO in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). FFO reflects net income (loss) attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc. adjusted to exclude gains and losses from the sale of real estate assets, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, amortization of direct lease acquisition costs and the same adjustments for our equity-based investments and redeemable and non-redeemable noncontrolling interests, as well as the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We calculate AFFO as FFO adjusted to include cash paid for direct lease acquisition costs as such costs are generally amortized over a period ranging from four weeks to one year and therefore are incurred on a regular basis. AFFO also includes cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures since these are routine uses of cash that are necessary for our operations. In addition, AFFO excludes losses on extinguishment of debt, as well as certain non-cash items, including non-real estate depreciation and amortization, impairment charges on non-real estate assets, stock-based compensation expense, accretion expense, the non-cash effect of straight-line rent, amortization of deferred financing costs and the same adjustments for our redeemable and non-redeemable noncontrolling interests, along with the non-cash portion of income taxes, and the related income tax effect of adjustments, as applicable. We use FFO and AFFO measures for managing our business and for planning and forecasting future periods, and each is an important indicator of our operational strength and business performance, especially compared to other REITs. Our management believes users of our financial data are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in managing, planning and executing our business strategy. Our management also believes that the presentations of FFO and AFFO, as supplemental measures, are useful in evaluating our business because adjusting results to reflect items that have more bearing on the operating performance of REITs highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. It is management s opinion that these supplemental measures provide users of our financial data with an important perspective on our operating performance and also make it easier to compare our results to other companies in our industry, as well as to REITs. 
 
 Since Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin, FFO and AFFO are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to OUTFRONT Media Inc., and revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, these measures do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.

Segment Results of Operations 
 
 We present Adjusted OIBDA as the primary measure of profit and loss for our U.S. Media reportable segment and Other . (See the Key Performance Indicators section of this MD A and Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 
 
 We currently manage our operations through one operating segment, U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment. Prior to its sale, our Canadian operations comprised our International operating segment, which did not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, was included in Other . Historical operating results of our Canadian operations are included in Other through the date of sale (see Note 18. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our segment reporting therefore includes U.S. Media and Other . 
 
 The following table presents our Revenues , Adjusted OIBDA and Operating income (loss) by segment in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Total U.S. Media segment revenues increased 22.8 million, or 5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to higher transit and other revenues, as well as higher billboard revenues. Total U.S. Media segment revenues increased 53.9 million, or 4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to higher transit and other revenues, as well as higher billboard revenues. We generated approximately 42 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, 43 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, 41 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 42 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of our U.S. Media segment revenues from national advertising campaigns. 
 
 Billboard revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased 16.6 million, or 5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, reflecting an increase in average revenue per display (yield), driven by the impact of programmatic and direct sale advertising platforms on digital billboard revenues, the impact of new and lost billboards in the period, including insignificant acquisitions, and higher proceeds from condemnations. Billboard revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased 32.4 million, or 3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, reflecting an increase in average revenue per display (yield), driven by the impact of programmatic and direct sale advertising platforms on digital billboard revenues and the impact of new and lost billboards in the period, including insignificant acquisitions, partially offset by lower proceeds from condemnations. 
 
 Transit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased 6.2 million, or 7 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in average revenue per display (yield), partially offset by the impact of new and lost transit franchise contracts in the period. Transit and other revenues in the U.S. Media segment increased 21.5 million, or 9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in average revenue per display (yield), partially offset by the impact of new and lost transit franchise contracts in the period. 
 
 Operating expenses in the U.S. Media segment increased 7.1 million, or 3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily driven by higher guaranteed minimum annual payments to the MTA, higher compensation-related expenses and higher posting and rotation costs, driven by higher business activity, partially offset by lower variable property lease expenses and the net impact of new and lost transit franchise contracts. Operating expenses in the

 U.S. Media segment increased 14.0 million, or 2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily driven by higher billboard revenues, higher compensation-related expenses, higher guaranteed minimum annual payments to the MTA, higher posting and rotation costs, driven by higher business activity, and higher maintenance and utilities cost, driven by inflationary cost increases, partially offset by the net impact of new and lost transit franchise contracts. 
 
 SG A expenses in the U.S. Media segment increased 2.4 million, or 3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily driven by higher compensation-related expenses, partially offset by lower professional fees and a lower provision for doubtful accounts. SG A expenses in the U.S. Media segment increased 9.7 million, or 4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily driven by higher compensation-related expenses and higher rent related to new offices, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of 17.9 million in the U.S. Media segment, primarily related to impairment charges with respect to our MTA asset group and our U.S. Transit and Other reporting unit. We did not record any impairment charges in the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 12.1 million and in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 523.5 million in the U.S. Media segment, primarily related to impairment charges with respect to our MTA asset group and our U.S. Transit and Other reporting unit. (See Note 4. Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 
 
 U.S. Media segment Adjusted OIBDA increased 13.3 million, or 11 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased 30.2 million, or 9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period. Adjusted OIBDA margin was 30 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, 28 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, 27 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 26 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in Adjusted OIBDA margin were due primarily to a higher increases in Adjusted OIBDA compared to lower increases in revenues.

 Corporate 
 
 Corporate expenses primarily include expenses associated with employees who provide centralized services. Corporate expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, increased 6.7 million, or 70 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, and increased 13.4 million, or 38 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period. The increases were primarily due to higher professional fees, as a result of a management consulting project, higher compensation-related expenses and the impact of market fluctuations on an unfunded equity-linked retirement plan offered by the Company to certain employees.

 We continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, certain of our municipal transit contracts require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid on a monthly or quarterly basis, as applicable. 
 
 Our short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, interest, capital expenditures, equipment deployment costs and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), the AR Facility (as defined below) or other credit facilities that we may establish, to the extent available. 
 
 In addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology, directly or in connection with joint ventures (including buy/sell arrangements with joint venture partners). Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions,

 which transactions and transaction-related expenses will be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof. 
 
 Our long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and commitments related to operating leases and franchise and other agreements, including any related guaranteed minimum annual payments, and equipment deployment costs. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other credit facilities that we may establish, to the extent available. 
 
 Although we have taken several actions to date to enhance our financial flexibility and increase our liquidity, our short-term and long-term cash needs and related funding capability may be adversely affected by the current levels of inflation and related economic environment if cash on hand and operating cash flows decrease in 2024, and our ability to issue debt and equity securities and/or borrow under our existing or new credit facilities on reasonable pricing terms, or at all, may become uncertain. (See the Overview section of this MD A.) 
 
 Working capital was a deficit of 183.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to a deficit of 195.4 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the impact of the Transaction. 
 
 Under the current MTA agreement, which was amended in June 2020 and July 2021 and is subject to modification as agreed-upon by us and the MTA (as amended, the MTA Agreement ): 
 
 Deployments . We must deploy, over a number of years, (i) 5,433 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 15,896 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock, and (iii) 9,283 MTA communications displays. We are also obligated to deploy certain additional digital advertising screens and MTA communications displays in subway and train stations and rolling stock that the MTA may build or acquire in the future (collectively, the New Inventory ). 
 
 Recoupment of Equipment Deployment Costs. We may retain incremental revenues that exceed an annual base revenue amount for the cost of deploying advertising and communications displays throughout the transit system. As presented in the table below, recoupable MTA equipment deployment costs are recorded as Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs and Intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and as these costs are recouped from incremental revenues that the MTA would otherwise be entitled to receive, Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs will be reduced. If incremental revenues generated over the term of the agreement are not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the equipment deployment costs, the costs will not be recouped, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including impairment charges (see Note 4. Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we do not recoup all costs of deploying advertising and communications screens with respect to the New Inventory by the end of the term of the MTA Agreement, the MTA will be obligated to reimburse us for these costs. Deployment costs in an amount not to exceed 50.7 million, which are deemed authorized before December 31, 2020, will be paid directly by the MTA. For any deployment costs deemed authorized after December 31, 2020, the MTA and the Company will no longer be obligated to directly pay 70 and 30 of the costs, respectively, and these costs will be subject to recoupment in accordance with the MTA Agreement. We did not recoup any equipment deployment costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we currently do not expect to recoup any equipment deployment costs throughout the remainder of the Amended Term (as defined below) of the MTA Agreement. We expect our MTA equipment deployment costs to be approximately 50.0 million in 2024. After 2024, we expect MTA equipment deployment costs to be approximately 30.0 million to 40.0 million annually throughout the remainder of the Amended Term (as defined below) of the MTA Agreement and encompass replacement costs. Accordingly, we expect annual MTA equipment deployment costs after 2024 to be significantly below prior year levels as we have substantially completed our initial deployment during 2024. 
 
 Payments . We must pay to the MTA the greater of a percentage of revenues or a guaranteed minimum annual payment. Our payment obligations with respect to guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts owed to the MTA resumed on January 1, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the MTA Agreement, and any guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts that would have been paid for the period from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (less any revenue share amounts actually paid during this period using an increased revenue share percentage of 65 will instead be added in equal increments to the guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts owed for the period from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2026. The MTA Agreement also provides that if prior to April 1, 2028 the balance of unrecovered costs of deploying advertising and communications screens throughout the transit system is equal to or less than zero, then in any year following the year in which such recoupment occurs (the Recoupment Year ), the MTA is entitled to receive an additional payment equal to 2.5 of the annual base revenue amount for such year calculated in accordance with the MTA Agreement, provided that gross revenues in such year (i) were at 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 least equal to the gross revenues generated in the Recoupment Year, and (ii) did not decline by more than 5 from the prior year. 
 
 Term . In July 2021, we extended the initial 10-year term of the MTA Agreement to a 13-year base term (the Amended Term ). We have the option to extend the Amended Term for an additional five-year period at the end of the Amended Term, subject to satisfying certain quantitative and qualitative conditions. 
 
 We may utilize cash on hand and/or incremental third-party financing to fund equipment deployment costs over the next couple of years. However, given the current levels of inflation and related economic environment, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate financing amount, if any, at this time. As of September 30, 2024, we have issued surety bonds in favor of the MTA totaling approximately 136.0 million, which amount is subject to change as equipment installations are completed and revenues are generated. As indicated in the table below, we incurred 24.5 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (which includes equipment deployment costs related to future deployments), for a total of 604.1 million to date, of which 33.9 million had been recouped from incremental revenues to date. As of September 30, 2024, 25,345 digital displays had been installed, composed of 5,008 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, 14,548 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock and 5,789 MTA communications displays. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, 1,374 installations occurred, for a total of 5,648 installations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 MTA performance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was slightly better than the expectations and assumptions included in our year-end 2023 model and our current long-term assumptions continue to be in line with our year-end 2023 model. As a result of negative aggregate cash flow forecasts related to our MTA asset group, we performed quarterly impairment analyses on the MTA asset group during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and recorded impairment charges of 9.1 million and 8.8 million, respectively, in those periods for a total of 17.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charges recorded during 2024 represented additional MTA equipment deployment cost spending during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our analysis performed as of September 30, 2024, resulted in positive aggregate cash flows in excess of the carrying value of our MTA asset group. As such, no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. (See the Critical Accounting Policies section of this MD A and Note 4. Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) We currently expect positive aggregate cash flows on an undiscounted basis from the fourth quarter of 2024 through to the end of the Amended Term of the MTA Agreement. If our MTA performance continues to be in line with, or better than, our current model, we would not expect to incur additional impairment charges on our MTA equipment deployment cost spending. There can be no assurance that these estimates and assumptions will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and a downward revision of these estimates and/or assumptions would decrease our cash flows, which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.

 On November 12, 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a special dividend of 0.75 per share on our common stock payable on December 31, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2024. Approximately 0.30 per share will be paid in cash (exclusive of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) and approximately 0.45 per share will be paid in shares of our common stock. Stockholders will have the option to elect to receive their special dividend in all cash or all stock, however the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed will be equal to approximately 49.8 million, with the balance of the special dividend payable in the form of our common stock.

To offset the dilutive impact of the common stock portion of the special dividend, our board of directors also approved a reverse stock split, which we expect to complete in January 2025.

 Term Loan 
 
 The interest rate on the term loan due in 2026 (the Term Loan was 6.6 per annum as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, a discount of 0.5 million on the Term Loan remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through Interest expense, net , on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In June 2024, we prepaid 200.0 million of the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a Loss on extinguishment of debt of 1.2 million on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, relating to the write-off of deferred financing costs and a portion of the discount on the Term Loan. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 We also have a 500.0 million revolving credit facility, which matures in 2028 (the Revolving Credit Facility, together with the Term Loan, the Senior Credit Facilities ). 
 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.5 million in each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately 5.7 million against the letter of credit facility sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Standalone Letter of Credit Facilities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately 65.0 million under our aggregate 81.0 million standalone letter of credit facilities. The total fees under the letter of credit facilities were immaterial in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have a 150.0 million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the AR Facility ), which terminates in June 2027, unless further extended. 
 
 On June 14, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the agreements governing the AR Facility, pursuant to which we (i) extended the term of the AR Facility so that it now terminates on June 14, 2027, unless further extended; and (ii) modified the upfront fee and modified the program fee so that the program fee may increase or decrease based on the Company s Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined and described below). The amendment to the agreements governing the AR Facility do not change how we account for the AR Facility as a collateralized financing activity. 
 
 In connection with the AR Facility, Outfront Media LLC and Outfront Media Outernet Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain of the Company s taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs (the Originators ), will sell and/or contribute their respective existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to either Outfront Media Receivables LLC, a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company s qualified REIT subsidiary accounts receivable assets (the QRS SPV or Outfront Media Receivables TRS, LLC a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company s TRS accounts receivable assets (the TRS SPV and together with the QRS SPV, the SPVs ). The SPVs may transfer undivided interests in their respective accounts receivable assets to certain purchasers from time to time (the Purchasers ). The SPVs are separate legal entities with their own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPVs assets before the assets become available to the Company. Accordingly, the SPVs assets are not available to pay creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers and other creditors of the SPVs may be remitted to the Company. Outfront Media LLC will service the accounts receivables on behalf of the SPVs for a fee. The Company has agreed to guarantee the performance of the Originators and Outfront Media LLC, in its capacity as servicer, of their respective obligations under the agreements governing the AR Facility. Neither the Company, the Originators nor the SPVs guarantee the collectability of the receivables under the AR Facility. Further, the TRS SPV and the QRS SPV are jointly and severally liable for their respective obligations under the agreements governing the AR Facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 40.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility, at a borrowing rate of 6.3 . As of September 30, 2024, borrowing capacity remaining under the AR Facility was 110.0 million based on approximately 339.8 million of accounts receivable that could be used as collateral for the AR Facility in accordance with the agreements governing the AR Facility. The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the AR Facility was 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2023, 0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In October and November 2024, we made repayments totaling 20.0 million under the AR Facility. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 Our credit agreement, dated as of January 31, 2014 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement ), governing the Senior Credit Facilities, the agreements governing the AR Facility, and the indentures governing our senior notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that restrict the Company s and its subsidiaries abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company s or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC s capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany or third-party transfers, and (iii) incur additional indebtedness. One of the exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur additional indebtedness is satisfaction of a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.9 to 1.0, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transaction, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The terms of the Credit Agreement (and under certain circumstances, the agreements governing the AR Facility) require that we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to 150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.5 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.6 to 1.0, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transaction, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with our debt covenants. 
 
 Deferred Financing Costs 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had deferred 22.4 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility, the AR Facility and our senior notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through Interest expense, net, on our Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Facility and our senior notes. 
 
 Equity 
 
 At-the-Market Equity Offering Program 
 
 We have a sales agreement in connection with an at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program ), under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 300.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any of our common stock under the sales agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the sales agreement. No shares were sold under the ATM Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 232.5 million of capacity remaining under the ATM Program. 
 
 Series A Preferred Stock Issuance 
 
 On April 20, 2020, we issued 400,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock ), par value 0.01 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of the Company s common stock with respect to dividend and distribution rights. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend accruing at the initial rate of 7.0 per year, payable quarterly in arrears, subject to increases as set forth in the Articles Supplementary, effective as of April 20, 2020 (the Articles ). Dividends may, at the option of the Company, be paid in cash, in-kind, through the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or a combination of cash and in-kind, until April 20, 2028, after which time dividends will be payable solely in cash. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company may not, without the consent of a specified percentage of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, declare a dividend on, or make any distributions relating to, capital stock that ranks junior to, or on a parity basis with, the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to (i) any dividend or distribution in cash or capital stock of the Company on or in respect of the capital stock of the Company to the extent that such dividend or distribution is necessary to maintain the Company s status as a REIT; and (ii) any dividend or distribution in cash in respect of our common stock that, together with the dividends or distributions during the 12-month period immediately preceding such dividend or distribution, is not in excess of 5 of the aggregate dividends or distributions paid by the Company necessary to maintain its REIT status during such 12-month period. If any dividends or distributions in respect of the shares of our common stock are paid in cash, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock will participate in the dividends or distributions on an as-converted basis up to the amount of their accrued dividend for such quarter, which amounts will reduce the dividends payable on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock dollar-for-dollar for such quarter. The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of any holder at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 16.00 per share and an initial conversion rate of 62.50 shares of our common stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments and a share cap as set forth in the Articles. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Articles (including a change of control), each of the Company and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may convert or redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at the prices set forth in the Articles, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.

 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents our cash flows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Net cash flow provided by operating activities 174.7 149.2 17 Net cash flow provided by (used for) investing activities 230.7 (93.4) Net cash flow used for financing activities (413.0) (51.9) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (0.4) 0.1 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 (8.0) 4.0 
 Calculation is not meaningful. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased 25.5 million, or 17 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, due primarily to a decrease in prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs, and a smaller use of cash related to accounts payable and accrued expenses, driven by lower incentive compensation payments made in 2024, partially offset by the timing of receivables and lower net income in 2024 compared to 2023, due to increased SG A expenses and higher interest expense. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid net cash of 18.8 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs and installed 5,648 digital displays. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid net cash of 33.4 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs and installed 4,633 digital displays. 
 
 Cash provided by investing activities was 230.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Cash used by investing activities of 93.4 million in the same prior-year period, due primarily to cash received from the Transaction and lower cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures. 
 
 The following table presents our capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Growth 42.0 39.1 7 Maintenance 
 17.9 24.5 (27) Total capital expenditures 59.9 63.6 (6) 
 
 Capital expenditures decreased 3.7 million, or 6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same prior-year period, primarily due to lower spending related to the renovation of certain office facilities and lower spending on software and technology, partially offset by increased growth in digital displays, increased maintenance spending for billboard display upgrades, and higher spending on safety-related projects. 
 
 For the full year of 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 85.0 million, which will be used primarily for growth in digital displays, the renovation of certain office facilities, software and technology, maintenance and safety-related projects. This estimate does not include equipment deployment costs that will be incurred in connection with the MTA Agreement (as described above). 
 
 Cash used for financing activities increased by 361.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior-year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we prepaid 200.0 million on the outstanding balance of the Term Loan, made net repayments on the AR Facility of 25.0 million and paid total cash dividends of 156.4 million on our common stock, the Series A Preferred Stock and vested restricted share units granted to employees, and paid 23.9 million related to the exercise of a buy/sell arrangement by one of our joint venture partners resulting in our purchase of the outstanding noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we drew 120.0 million of net borrowings on the AR Facility and paid total cash dividends of 155.4 million on our common stock, the Series A Preferred Stock and vested restricted share units granted to employees. 
 
 Cash paid for income taxes was 11.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to income tax payments related to the Transaction.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Our off-balance sheet commitments primarily consist of guaranteed minimum annual payments. (See Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our off-balance sheet commitments.) 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. 
 
 For information regarding accounting policies we consider to be the most critical as they are significant to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. 
 
 For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8., Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We are exposed to market risk related to commodity prices and to a limited extent, interest rates and credit risks. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We incur various operating costs that are subject to price risk caused by volatility in underlying commodity values. Commodity price risk is present in electricity costs associated with powering our digital billboard displays and lighting our traditional static billboard displays at night. 
 
 We do not currently use derivatives or other financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk. However, we do enter into contracts with commodity providers to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, such contracts accounted for 6.2 of our total utility costs. As of September 30, 2024, we had active electricity purchase agreements with fixed contract rates for locations in Illinois, New Jersey and Texas, which expire at various dates through June 2025. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we have variable-rate debt outstanding, including under the Senior Credit Facilities and the AR Facility. 
 64 

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, we had a 400.0 million variable-rate Term Loan due 2026 outstanding, which has an interest rate of 6.6 per year. An increase or decrease of 1/4 in our interest rate on the Term Loan will change our annualized interest expense by approximately 1.0 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 40.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility, at a borrowing rate of 6.3 . An increase or decrease of 1/4 in our interest rate on the AR Facility will change our annualized interest expense by approximately 0.1 million. In October and November 2024, we made repayments totaling 20.0 million under the AR Facility. 
 
 We are not currently using derivatives or other financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk, although we may do so in the future. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 In the opinion of our management, credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers and advertising agencies utilized. We perform credit evaluations on our customers and agencies and believe that the allowances for credit losses are adequate. We do not currently use derivatives or other financial instruments to mitigate credit risk. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 On an ongoing basis, we are engaged in lawsuits and governmental proceedings and respond to various investigations, inquiries, notices and claims from national, state and local governmental and other authorities (collectively, litigation ). Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in our opinion, none of our current litigation is expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 We have disclosed the risk factors affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed.
