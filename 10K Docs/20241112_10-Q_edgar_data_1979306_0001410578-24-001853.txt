A portion of the Incentive Compensation is based on a percentage of the Company s income (an Income Incentive Fee and a portion is based on a percentage of the Company s capital gains (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee ). The Income Incentive Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized or unrealized capital gains or losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income will be compared to a hurdle amount, Hurdle Amount equal to the product of (i) the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) and (ii) the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did t incur any Income Incentive Fees. Capital Gains Incentive Fee The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears and equals (i) of the Company s realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year prior to a Liquidity Event (as defined below), and (ii) of the Company s realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year after a Liquidity Event. A Liquidity Event may include (1) an initial public offering IPO ), (2) an Exchange Listing or (3) a Sale Transaction. A Sale Transaction means (a) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets to, or other liquidity event with, another entity or (b) a transaction or series of transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or sale of Shares, in each case for consideration of either cash and/or publicly listed securities of the acquirer. In determining the Capital Gains Incentive Fee payable to the Adviser, the Company calculates the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since the Company s inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in the Company s portfolio. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for the Company s calculation of the Capital Gains Incentive Fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to the Company s portfolio of investments. If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a fiscal year, a Capital Gains Incentive Fee shall be calculated as of the day before the Exchange Listing, with such Capital Gains Incentive Fee paid to the Adviser following the end of the fiscal year in which the Exchange Listing occurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did t incur any Capital Gains Incentive Fees.

In connection with that determination, investment valuations will be prepared using ranges of valuations obtained from independent valuation firms, and/or proprietary models depending on the materiality of the investments, the availability of information on the Company s investments and the type of investment being valued, all in accordance with the Valuation Policy. Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. As part of the valuation process, the factors that may be taken into account in determining the fair value of the Company s investments, include, as relevant: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Adviser s valuation committee will consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of the portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Adviser carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value the Company s portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company. Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are valued based on an expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis. Investments in debt securities with sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying security. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow typically represent the relevant security s contractual interest, fees and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the security s expected maturity date.

As of September 30, 2024, given there were no material market movements in credit spreads from the Effective Date through September 30, 2024, and given the underlying interest rate on any secured borrowing is based on an underlying index that resets on a periodic basis, the carrying values of the secured borrowings approximate fair value. Secured borrowings are categorized as Level 3 within the hierarchy.

 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was income tax expense or benefit recorded as the Company had taxable income. At September 30, 2024, the Company determined a valuation allowance was required. The Company s assessment considered, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the associated risk that operating loss and capital loss carryforwards are limited or are likely to expire unused. Through the consideration of these factors, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company s net deferred tax asset would not be realized. As a result, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2024. From time to time, the Company may modify its estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability and/or asset balances and any applicable valuation allowance as new information becomes available. Modifications to the Company s estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability and/or asset balances and any applicable valuation allowance, changes in generally accepted accounting principles or related guidance or interpretations thereof, limitations imposed on or expirations of the Company s net operating losses and capital loss carryovers (if any) and changes in applicable tax law could result in increases or decreases in the Company s NAV per share, which could be material. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for federal and state income tax purposes of . This net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any capital loss carryforward.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend, target, goals, plan, forecast, project, other variations on these words or comparable terminology, or the negative of these words are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

We have based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to us on the date of this Form 10-Q and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements, unless we are required to do so by applicable law. However, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including subsequent amendments to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Summary of Risk Factors An investment in the Company s limited liability company interests Shares involves significant risks. The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in the Shares. These are not the only risks the Company faces. This summary should be read closely together with the risk factors set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports and documents the Company files with the SEC. The Company has a limited operating history. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), which imposes numerous restrictions on the activities of the Company, including restrictions on leverage and on the nature of its investments. The use of leverage magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested. The use of leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique and increases the risks associated with investing in our securities, including, but not limited to, Andalusian Credit Partners, LLC s ACP, in such capacity, the Adviser incentives in determining to pursue more volatile investments, which could cause a reduction of the rate of return for investors in the event that the Company s investments have not performed well. The Company invests primarily in privately-held companies for which very little public information exists. Such companies are also generally more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience substantial variations in operating results. 

 21 

Table of Contents 
 The Company invests in privately-held companies and securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as junk have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They will also be difficult to value and are illiquid. Defaults by portfolio companies will harm the Company s operating results. An investment in the Company is suitable only for sophisticated investors and requires the financial ability and willingness to accept the high risks and lack of liquidity inherent in an investment in the Company. An investment in our Shares is not suitable for you if you might need access to the money you invest in the foreseeable future. If you are unable to sell your Shares, you will be unable to reduce your exposure on any market downturn. Our Shares are not currently listed on an exchange and given that we have no current intention of pursuing any such listing, it is unlikely that a secondary trading market will develop for our Shares. The purchase of our Shares is intended to be a long-term investment. Our distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital (i.e., a distribution funded solely by investors Capital Commitments (as defined herein)) and reduce the amount of capital available to us for investment. Any capital returned to you through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. The Company is subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent the Company uses debt to finance its investments, changes in interest rates will affect the cost of capital and net investment income. The Company is classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, which means that the Company is not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the proportion of its assets that it may invest in securities of a single issuer. The Company depends on the Adviser for its success and upon its access to investment professionals. The Company operates in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. The Company s debt investments may be risky and could result in the loss of all or part of its investments. There is no public market for the Shares. There are restrictions on holders of the Shares Members ). There is a risk that investors may not receive distributions. There is a risk that a Member may default on its obligations to fund Capital Commitments, which can adversely affect the Company and its Members. The Company is operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. The Company s regulatory structure as a BDC and expected tax status as a regulated investment company (a RIC could limit certain of the Company s investments or negatively affect the Company s investment returns. Future changes in laws or regulations and conditions in the Company s operating areas could have an adverse impact on the Company.

 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Overview The Company was formed on October 17, 2022, as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have been formed to provide Members with access to a portfolio of investments in the equity or debt of private U.S. companies or public companies with less than 250 million in market capitalization. The Company is externally managed by ACP, a Delaware limited liability company that is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. ACP also serves as the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator has retained SS C as a sub-administrator to perform any or all of its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Key Components of Our Results of Operations Investments We invest primarily in senior secured loans with a first lien on collateral, including unitranche loans, which are loans that combine the characteristics of both first lien and second lien debt of U.S. middle-market companies. Our level of investment activity can and is expected to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Revenues We generate revenue in the form of interest income and fees primarily from senior secured loans with some capital appreciation through nominal equity co-investments. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind, or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we expect to receive will be directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has invested 86,206,380 in ten portfolio companies. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. Dividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies. Our portfolio activity may also reflect the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Statements of Operations.

 Expenses We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, under which we pay the Adviser fees for investment management services consisting of the Management Fee and the Incentive Compensation. The services necessary for our business, including the origination and administration of our investment portfolio, will be provided by individuals who are employees of ACP and SS C, as our Administrator and Sub-Administrator, respectively, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement and Sub-Administration Agreement, respectively. All investment professionals of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services under the Advisory Agreement, and the compensation and routine compensation-related overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser and not by the Company. We pay to the Administrator an annual Administration Fee of 0.25 on the Company s total Capital Commitments, i.e. the sum of the Members funded Capital Commitments and unfunded Capital Commitments at the end of each fiscal quarter, payable quarterly in arrears, for services and facilities provided under the Administration Agreement. We will bear all other costs and expenses of the Company s operations and transactions, including legal, accounting, tax, auditing, consulting and other professional expenses (including, without limitation, expenses relating to establishing reputation and public relations in connection with self-sourced lending or other financial transactions); the Management Fee and Incentive Compensation; professional liability insurance (including costs relating to managers and officers liability insurance and errors and omissions insurance); research and market data expenses; interest on indebtedness; custodial fees; bank service fees; investment-related fees and expenses (such as third-party sourcing fees, fees and expenses of legal and other professionals, due diligence expenses and travel, lodging and meal expenses) related to the analysis, purchase or sale of investments, whether or not the investments are consummated; expenses related to special purpose vehicles SPVs organized to hold certain Company investments; interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance the Company s investments; other expenses related to the purchase, monitoring, sale, settlement, custody or transmittal of Company assets (directly or through trading affiliates) as will be determined by the Adviser, Administrator, and Sub-Administrator or an affiliate thereof, as applicable, in its sole discretion (including costs associated with systems and software used in connection with investment-related activities); costs of reporting to Members and investor meetings; administration fees and expenses charged by any third-party provider of administration services; entity-level taxes; offering expenses (subject to a Cap of 1.50 of aggregate Capital Commitments to the Company over the initial four-year period following November 14, 2023 (the Initial Closing Date )) including any expenses relating to the offer, transfer, sale and marketing of Shares (including all expenses incurred in connection with an initial public offering IPO )); filing fees and expenses; Federal and state registration fees and expenses; regulatory and compliance fees and expenses of the Company (including with respect to any registration activities of the Company); costs of winding up and liquidating the Company; costs associated with ensuring compliance with the applicable BDC and RIC requirements, including, but not limited to, costs incurred in connection with the organization of, and transfer of assets to, a private investment vehicle; expenses incurred in connection with a defaulting Member; and other expenses associated with the operation of the Company and its investment activities, including extraordinary expenses such as litigation, workout and restructuring and indemnification expenses, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will also bear its allocable share (based on invested capital) of any of the expenses listed above incurred by any SPV. The Company will also be responsible for any ongoing costs and expenses relating to distributions paid to Members; costs of effecting sales and repurchases of the Company s securities; allocated costs incurred by the Adviser or its affiliate in providing managerial assistance to those companies in which the Company has invested who request it; transfer agent fees; fees and expenses paid to the Company s Independent Board members (including expenses and costs related to meetings of the Independent Board members); costs of preparing and filing reports with the SEC and other Company reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees; the Company s allocable portion of the fidelity bond; the costs of reports, proxy statements or other notices to Members, including printing and mailing costs; the costs of any Members meetings and communications; expenses payable under any underwriting agreement, including associated fees, expenses and any indemnification obligations; any underwriting or other expenses arising in connection with any listing on a nationally recognized stock exchange Exchange Listing or other Liquidity Event (as defined below); and all other expenses incurred by the Company in connection with maintaining its status as a BDC. A Liquidity Event may include (1) an IPO (2) an Exchange Listing or (3) a Sale Transaction (as defined below). A Sale Transaction means (a) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets to, or other liquidity event with, another entity or (b) a transaction or series of transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or sale of Shares, in each case for consideration of either cash and/or publicly listed securities of the acquirer. From time to time, the Adviser or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our Members.

 In accordance with its operating documents and agreements, the Company bears investment related research and data costs in support of its overall operations. Generally, these expenses will be allocated among the Company and other funds or accounts managed by the Adviser on a pro rata basis. However, the Adviser has authority to negotiate arrangements with other funds and accounts pursuant to which those funds and accounts will not bear such expenses, despite benefiting, directly or indirectly, from the applicable products and services by participating in investments that have been analyzed with the help of those resources. In such instances, the Company and other funds and accounts that have not entered into such arrangements with the Adviser will bear more than their respective pro rata share of the applicable expenses. The Adviser currently manages one separate account client that does not bear investment related research and data costs pursuant to such an arrangement. Leverage The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. On August 1, 2023, we received approval from ACP, as our sole initial Member, for the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. Effective on August 2, 2023, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities was reduced from 200 to 150 . As a result, we generally will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of limited liability company interests senior to the Shares if its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least be equal to 200 immediately after each such issuance. This reduced asset coverage ratio permits us to double the amount of leverage it can incur. For example, under a 150 asset coverage ratio we may borrow 2 for investment purposes of every 1 of investor equity whereas under a 200 asset coverage ratio we may only borrow 1 for investment purposes for every 1 of investor equity. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowings and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities. Portfolio and Investment Activity Below is a summary of certain characteristics of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024: 

Number of investments 17 Number of portfolio companies 10 Percentage of total investment fair value First lien term loans 100.0 Percentage of debt investment fair value Floating rate (1) 100.0 Fixed interest rate Weighted average yield (2) 10.7 

 (1) Primarily subject to interest rate floors. (2) Weighted average yield is calculated by weighting the yield to maturity of each investment by its ending funded par amount. Yield to maturity is calculated inclusive of a portfolio company s spread, reference rate floor (if any) or actual reference rate in effect and original issue discount through maturity and excludes any upfront fees or present value adjustments. The weighted average yield of our accruing debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our Members but, rather, relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and any of our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield is computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.

 We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process. We consider board observation rights, where appropriate, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors or independent shareholders and detailed, internally-generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. ACP has developed a monitoring template that is designed to reasonably ensure compliance with these standards. This template will be used by ACP as a tool to assess investment performance relative to our plan. In addition, we anticipate that our portfolio companies will often rely on ACP to provide them with financial and capital markets advice and expertise. As part of the monitoring process, ACP regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by ACP and its affiliates. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as ACP s internal performance ratings: Grade 1: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is substantially within or above ACP s expectations and whose risk factors are neutral to favorable to those at the time of the original investment or subsequent restructuring. All investments will initially be graded as a 1. Grade 2: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is below ACP s expectations and that require closer monitoring; however, the adverse impact may be deemed temporary, and the most likely outcome is that no loss of investment return (interest and/or dividends) or principal is expected. Grade 3: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is below ACP s expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of investment return is likely, but no loss of principal is expected. Companies graded 3 generally present a higher risk of liquidity pressure and/or covenant breach over the next six to twelve months. These investments will be added to ACP s watch list. Investment teams will research any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the company. Grade 4: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below ACP s expectations where business trends have deteriorated and risk factors have increased substantially since the original investment or subsequent restructuring, potentially resulting in a breach of covenants or other event of default. Investments graded 4 are those for which some loss of principal or invested capital is likely. For these investments, our investment teams review the loans on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursue workout actions that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration. 
 ACP monitors and, when appropriate, changes the performance ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. ACP reviews our investment ratings in connection with our quarterly valuation process. The below table summarizes the internal performance ratings assigned as of September 30, 2024. 

September 30, 2024 Percentage of Internal Performance Rating Investments at Fair Value Total Investments 1 85,992,907 100.00 2 3 4 Total 85,992,907 100.00 Results of Operations Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful. The net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to a net investment loss of 4,924,276 in the early stage of the Company s operations.

 Investment Income We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold and cash equivalents. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interest obtained in connection with originated loans, such as options, warrants, or conversion rights. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns. Additionally, although we were initially capitalized on June 30, 2023, we commenced operations and began investing activities in November 2023. We generated 2,081,434 and 3,525,760 of investment income primarily from interest income, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code as soon as is reasonably practicable and intend to maintain its qualification as a RIC annually thereafter. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our Members in each taxable year generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income, if any for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our Members, which generally relieves us from U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates to the extent of such distributions. Upon our qualification as a RIC, depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. The character of income and gains that the Company distributes is determined in accordance with U.S. income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to Member dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We intend to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of the Private Offering and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We also intend to fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities. Our primary use of cash will be investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, payment of cash distributions to our Members and any repurchases of our Shares under our discretionary share repurchase program. We may from time to time enter into credit facilities or issue debt securities. Additional financings could include additional SPVs drop down facilities and unsecured notes. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . We seek to carefully consider our unfunded Capital Commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitment we are required to fund. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 are expected to be sufficient for our operations in the near term. Our long-term cash needs will include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and funding of additional portfolio investments. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from unused net proceeds from financing activities including drawdowns on Capital Commitments and fundings from the revolving credit facility with CIBC Bank USA (the CIBC Credit Facility ). We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term cash requirements. We cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to us in sufficient amounts in the future. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 13,989,476 and 1,011,952 in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 88,897,834 in cash for operating activities, primarily to fund new investments. Cash provided by financing activities was 101,875,358 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily the result of proceeds from issuance of Shares.

 Net Assets Share Issuances As of September 30, 2024, the Company had the authority to issue an unlimited number of Shares at 0.001 par value per share. Since inception through September 30, 2024, the Company has completed the following share issuances: 

Share Issuance Date Shares Issued Proceeds Received June 30, 2023 50 1,000 November 14, 2023 171,824 3,436,474 February 13, 2024 973,655 19,473,102 April 15, 2024 2,482,469 38,892,227 September 3, 2024 2,901,546 44,013,319 Total 6,529,544 105,816,122 The sales of the Shares were made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by the Company with its investors. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, each investor is required to fund drawdowns to purchase Shares up to the amount of their respective capital commitments each time the Company delivers a drawdown notice with a minimum of 10 business days prior notice to the date on which payment will be due. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 2,901,546 and 6,357,670 Shares at an average price of 15.17 and 16.10 through the Private Offering, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of 44,013,319 and 102,378,648, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 0 and 50 Shares to the Adviser at a price of 20.00, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of 0 and 1,000. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 6,529,544 and 171,874 Shares outstanding, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received Capital Commitments of 505,663,388 of which 399,578,023 was undrawn. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had received Capital Commitments of 380,519,213 of which 377,079,446 was undrawn. There were no dividends declared or reinvested from inception through September 30, 2024. Share Repurchases; Liquidity Event Prior to a Liquidity Event, and subject to market conditions and the Board s commercially reasonable judgment, the Company may from time to time offer to repurchase Shares pursuant to written tenders by Members. No Member has the right to require the Company to redeem his, her or its Shares. If a Liquidity Event has not occurred by May 20, 2027, the Board will use best efforts to commence quarterly repurchases of Shares with the first quarterly repurchase offer commencing on the first business day of the first full calendar quarter following May 20, 2027 or otherwise provide liquidity over a commercially reasonable period of time such that all investors who wish to liquidate their investment may do so. Repurchases of Shares from Members, by the Company, will be paid in cash. Repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by the Company of eligible written tenders of Shares from Members by the applicable repurchase offer deadline. The Company does not intend to impose any charges in connection with repurchases of Shares. The Company does not currently intend to institute a share repurchase program and share repurchases will be effected only in extremely limited circumstances in accordance with applicable law. Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any Shares.

 Debt Aggregate Borrowings As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 334,859 and 615,606 in interest expense and credit facility fees, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had no borrowings and did not incur any interest expense. Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had the following unfunded commitments:

 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We describe additional significant accounting policies in the notes to our financial statements in addition to those discussed below. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows. Investment Valuation The Company shall value its investments in accordance with the Valuation Policy approved by the Board. In accordance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as the Company s Valuation Designee . The Adviser has established a Valuation Committee that is responsible for determining the fair value of the Company s investments in instances where there is no readily available market quotation. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be priced by independent pricing services. The Adviser has retained an external, independent valuation firm to provide data and valuation analyses on the Company s portfolio companies. Revenue Recognition Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes accretion or amortization of discounts or premiums. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends. PIK interest represents accrued interest that is added to the principal amount of the investment on the respective interest payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity. PIK dividends represent accrued dividends that are added to the shares held of the equity investment on the respective interest payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at a certain trigger date. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion or amortization of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. If at any point we believe PIK interest is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest is generally reversed. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Organizational and Offering Expenses Organizational expenses to establish the Company are charged to expense as incurred. These expenses consist primarily of legal fees and other costs of organizing the Company. Offering expenses in connection with the offering of Shares are capitalized as a deferred charge and are amortized over a twelve-month period beginning with the latter of either the Initial Closing Date or from incurrence. These costs consist primarily of legal and other fees incurred in connection with the Company s Private Offering of its Shares.

 Income Taxes The Company intends to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code as soon as is reasonably practicable and intends to so qualify annually thereafter. So long as the Company maintains its tax treatment as a RIC, it generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income, or capital gains distributed to shareholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements as well as distribute each taxable year dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the Company s investment company taxable income, . Beginning with its first tax year end treated as a RIC, the Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its Members, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to its Members. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is recorded in the financial statements of the Company. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company would represent obligations of the Company s investors. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. For periods prior to the effectiveness of our RIC election, we expect to be taxed as a corporation. It is not anticipated that the Company will incur U.S. federal, state, and local taxes (other than nominal state and local taxes) as a corporation and consequently, no such taxes were accrued for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no tax expenses and no interest and penalties were incurred. Recent Developments On October 7, 2024, the Company invested 5.2 million in a first lien term loan with a yield of 9.9 and committed to a 1.0 million first lien delayed draw term loan and 0.6 million first lien revolver. On October 15, 2024, the Company committed to a 5.6 million first lien delayed draw term loan and 0.3 million first lien revolver. On October 21, 2024, the Company received 18.4 million in connection with the repayment, at par, of all outstanding commitments to Savory MB Stores, LLC plus a prepayment premium of 0.3 million. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to the floating rate investments we may hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. A rise in interest rates would also be expected to lead to higher cost on any floating rate borrowings we may have in the future. Valuation Risk We plan to invest primarily in illiquid debt securities of private middle-market companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with the Valuation Policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. The Adviser has retained an external, independent valuation firm to provide data and valuation analyses on the Company s portfolio companies.

 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In a low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. As of September 30, 2024, 100.0 of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at floating rates. Additionally, the weighted average reference rate floor, based on fair value, of our debt investments was 1.46 . The CIBC Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates with no interest rate floor. Based on our Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, assuming there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure, the following table shows the approximate annualized impact on net interest income, of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments): 

Basis Point Change Interest Income Interest Expense Net Interest Income Up 300 basis points 2,601,438 2,601,438 Up 200 basis points 1,734,292 1,734,292 Up 100 basis points 867,146 867,146 Down 100 basis points (867,146) (867,146) Down 200 basis points (1,734,292) (1,734,292) Down 300 basis points (2,601,438) (2,601,438) We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. Currency Risk From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each such investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future fair values and cash flows, as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our financial statements. We may use derivative instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we may have the ability to borrow in foreign currencies under any credit facilities or enter into other financing arrangements, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rate differences. We expect to typically be a net receiver of these foreign currencies as related for our international investment positions, and, as a result, our investments denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent not hedged, are expected to benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Credit Risk We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting to reputable financial institutions the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held the majority of our cash balances with a single highly rated banking institution and such balances are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We seek to mitigate this exposure by monitoring the credit standing of these financial institutions.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Neither we nor the Adviser are currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes since the filing of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 14, 2024 to the risk factors previously disclosed therein. If any of such risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the value of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Lack of Diversification and Limited Number of Portfolio Companies The Company is classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, which means that the Company is not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the proportion of its assets that it may invest in securities of a single issuer. The Company does not have fixed guidelines for diversification (other than certain maximum concentration limitations), and the Company could be concentrated in relatively few industries and portfolio companies. The Company could participate in a relatively limited number of investments and, as a consequence, the aggregate return could be substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of even a single investment. To the extent that the Company assumes large positions with respect to a small number of investments or industries, its valuation may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a more diversified investment company. Realized aggregate returns may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if the value of any one investment is written down, and a downturn in any particular industry in which the Company is invested could significantly affect its aggregate returns. To the extent that the Company operates as a non-diversified investment company, it may be subject to greater risk. Conflicts of Interest Certain of the Company s investment professionals serve or may serve in an investment management capacity to other funds managed by the Adviser and its affiliates (collectively, Andalusian or its related entities or unaffiliated entities and funds pursuant to which Andalusian makes its investment and portfolio management and monitoring teams available to the Adviser. As a result, investment professionals may allocate such time and attention as is deemed appropriate and necessary to carry out the operations of the managed funds. In this respect, they may experience diversions of their attention from the Company and potential conflicts of interest between their work for the Company and their work for other funds and clients in the event that the interests of other clients run counter to the Company s interests (for example where one or more investment vehicle or opportunity may be attractive to multiple parties). Andalusian may form, advise and/or manage one or more other funds with a strategy similar to that of the Company. In addition, other funds managed by Andalusian may have a different primary investment objective than the Company, but may, from time to time, invest in the same or similar asset classes that the Company targets. These investments may be made at the direction of the same individuals acting in their capacity on behalf of the Company and the managed funds. As a result, subject to the allocation restrictions (as described below), there may be conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities between the Company and the managed funds. In addition, affiliates of Andalusian may contract and/or otherwise conduct business with companies and partnerships in which the Company invests (directly or indirectly through funds) upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between such affiliates and entities. Specifically, one or more affiliates of Andalusian may negotiate to receive investment banking and other similar fees from funds and portfolio companies thereof. 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 Personnel or affiliates of Andalusian may acquire control over or acquire an interest in (directly or indirectly) one or more investment vehicles which are able to employ leverage in the form of bank loans. Should the Company invest into such an entity, the investment may have tax consequences for certain Members of the Company. Personnel or affiliates of Andalusian may acquire ownership and/or control over or acquire an interest in (directly or indirectly) a FINRA member-broker dealer. Additionally, or in connection therewith, personnel or affiliates of Andalusian may become registered representatives of a broker-dealer. In such a case, such broker (and/or such persons) may provide investment banking, placement or similar services for one or more Portfolio Investments. To the extent that the fees for such services are paid by the portfolio companies rather than by the Company, such fees will not reduce or otherwise offset the Management Fee payable by the Company to the Adviser. The Members of the Company may have conflicting tax and other interests with respect to their investment in the Company. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by Andalusian that may be more beneficial for one investor than for another investor, especially with respect to investors individual tax situations, including with respect to the making or financing of investments. Persons involved in the management of one or more Portfolio Investments may make Capital Commitments to the Company, either as Members or through Andalusian. Such capital commitments may create conflicts for such individuals in the management of such Portfolio Investments. In accordance with its operating documents and agreements, the Company bears investment related research and data costs in support of its overall operations. Generally, these expenses will be allocated among the Company and other funds or accounts managed by the Adviser on a pro rata basis. However, the Adviser has authority to negotiate arrangements with other funds and accounts pursuant to which those funds and accounts will not bear such expenses, despite benefiting, directly or indirectly, from the applicable products and services by participating in investments that have been analyzed with the help of those resources. In such instances, the Company and other funds and accounts that have not entered into such arrangements with the Adviser will bear more than their respective pro rata share of the applicable expenses. The Adviser currently manages one separate account client that does not bear investment related research and data costs pursuant to such an arrangement. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Except as previously reported by the Company on its current reports on Form 8-K, the Company did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that were not registered under the Securities Act. The Company did not repurchase any of its equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, of the Company s managers or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
