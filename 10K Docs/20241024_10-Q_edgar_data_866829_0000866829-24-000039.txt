Bank of America ), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Zions Bancorporation and subsequently we entered into various amendments (collectively, the Amended ABL Facility ). The most recent amendment on August 2, 2024 extended the maturity of the Amended ABL Facility and increased the letter of credit basket size. The Amended ABL Facility provides a million asset-based revolving credit facility, which matures on , with a springing maturity prior to the maturity of any outstanding indebtedness with a principal amount in excess of million. The Amended ABL Facility also permits us to request an increase of the facility by up to million, subject to certain conditions. Commitments under the Amended ABL Facility are comprised of separate U.S. and U.K. revolving credit facility commitments of million and million, respectively. The Amended ABL Facility provides funding based on a borrowing base calculation that includes eligible U.S. and U.K. customer accounts receivable and cash, and provides for a million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, we had borrowings under the Amended ABL Facility, and our available borrowing capacity, based on the borrowing base, totaled million, net of million of letters of credit issued. We and certain of our U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries are the current borrowers under the Amended ABL Facility, whose obligations under the Amended ABL Facility are guaranteed by those borrowers and certain other U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries, excluding Cal Dive I Title XI, Inc. CDI Title XI ), Helix Offshore Services Limited and certain other enumerated subsidiaries. Other subsidiaries may be added as guarantors of the facility in the future. The Amended ABL Facility is secured by all accounts receivable and designated deposit accounts of the U.S. borrowers and guarantors, and by substantially all of the assets of the U.K. borrowers and guarantors. U.S. borrowings under the Amended ABL Facility bear interest at the Term SOFR rate (also known as CME Term SOFR as administered by CME Group, Inc.) plus a margin of to or at a base rate plus a margin of to . U.K. borrowings under the Amended ABL Facility denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest at the Term SOFR rate with SOFR adjustment of and U.K. borrowings denominated in the British pound bear interest at the SONIA daily rate, each plus a margin of to . We also pay a commitment fee of to per annum on the unused portion of the facility. The Amended ABL Facility includes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, pay dividends and make distributions on equity interests, dispose of assets, make investments, repay certain indebtedness, engage in mergers, and other matters, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Amended ABL Facility contains customary default provisions which, if triggered, could result in acceleration of all amounts then outstanding. The Amended ABL Facility requires us to satisfy and maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to 1.0 if availability is less than the greater of of the borrowing base or million. The Amended ABL Facility also (i) limits the amount of permitted debt for the deferred purchase price of property not to exceed million, and (ii) provides for potential ESG-related pricing adjustments based on specific metrics and performance targets determined by us and Bank of America, as agent with respect to the Amended ABL Facility.

Performance Obligations As of September 30, 2024, billion related to unsatisfied performance obligations was expected to be recognized as revenue in the future, with million, million and million in 2024 , 2025 as well as 2026 and beyond, respectively. These amounts include fixed consideration and estimated variable consideration for both wholly and partially unsatisfied performance obligations, including mobilization and demobilization fees. These amounts are derived from the specific terms of our contracts, and the expected timing for revenue recognition is based on the estimated start date and duration of each contract according to the information known at September 30, 2024. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods were immaterial. Contract Fulfillment Costs Contract fulfillment costs consist of costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer. Our contract fulfillment costs primarily relate to costs incurred for mobilization of personnel and equipment at the beginning of a contract and costs incurred for demobilization at the end of a contract. Mobilization costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the contract term (including anticipated contract extensions) based on the pattern of the provision of services to which the contract fulfillment costs relate. Demobilization costs are recognized when incurred at the end of the contract. Deferred contract costs are reflected as Deferred costs, a component of Other current assets and Other assets, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (Note 3). Our deferred contract costs totaled million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million and million, respectively, related to amortization of these deferred contract costs. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, we recorded million and million, respectively, related to amortization of these deferred contract costs. There were no associated impairment losses for any period presented. For additional information regarding revenue recognition, see Notes 2 and 11 to our 2023 Form 10-K.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Our Business We are an international offshore energy services company that provides specialty services to the offshore energy industry, with a focus on well intervention, robotics and decommissioning operations. Our services are key in supporting a global energy transition by maximizing production of existing oil and gas reserves, decommissioning end-of-life oil and gas fields and supporting renewable energy developments. Our well intervention fleet includes seven purpose-built well intervention vessels and 12 subsea intervention systems. Our robotics equipment includes 39 work-class ROVs, six trenchers and two IROV boulder grabs. We charter robotics support vessels on long-term, short-term, flexible and spot bases to facilitate our ROV and trenching operations. Our Shallow Water Abandonment segment includes nine liftboats, six OSVs, three DSVs, one heavy lift derrick barge, one crew boat, 20 P A systems and six CT systems. Our Production Facilities segment includes the HP I , the HFRS and our ownership of mature oil and gas properties. Industry Influences and Market Environment Demand for our services is primarily influenced by the condition of the oil and gas and the renewable energy markets and, in particular, the willingness of offshore energy companies to spend on operational activities and capital projects. The performance of our business is largely affected by the prevailing market prices for oil and natural gas, which are impacted by domestic and global economic conditions, hydrocarbon production and capacity, geopolitical issues, weather, global health, and various other factors. Demand for decommissioning is affected by commodity prices as well as governmental regulations and political forces globally. Oil prices continue to be volatile but have generally remained robust since 2020. Global demand for oil continues to experience growth albeit at slower rates, and we expect the current market conditions will maintain continued customer spending for the industry. However, factors that could threaten the current commodity price environment persist, including regional conflicts, unrest in the Middle East, decisions from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and other non-OPEC producer nations (collectively with OPEC members, OPEC+ ), the global economy and the demand for oil and gas in China in particular, various governmental and customer sustainability initiatives and continued shifting of resource allocation to renewable energy. We expect these factors will continue to contribute to commodity price volatility with the potential to temper customer spending for oil and gas projects. We maximize production of existing oil and gas reserves for our customers primarily in our Well Intervention segment. Historically, drilling rigs have been the asset class used for offshore well intervention work, and rig day rates are a pricing indicator for our services. Our customers have used drilling rigs on existing long-term contracts (rig overhang) to perform well intervention work instead of new drilling activities. Current volumes of work, rig utilization rates, the day rates quoted by drilling rig contractors and existing rig overhang affect the utilization and/or rates we can achieve for our assets and services. We are seeing oil and gas companies continue to invest in long-cycle exploration projects in addition to maintaining and/or increasing production from their existing reserves. As historically production enhancement through well intervention is less expensive per incremental barrel of oil than exploration, we expect oil and gas companies to continue to focus on optimizing production of their existing subsea wells.

Table of Contents 
 Once end-of-life oil and gas wells have depleted their production, we decommission wells and infrastructure in our Well Intervention and Shallow Water Abandonment segments. Our operations service the life cycle of an oil and gas field and provide P A and decommissioning services at the end of the life of a field as required by governmental regulations. We believe that our well intervention vessels have a competitive advantage in performing these services efficiently and with our suite of shallow water assets and capabilities, we are the only provider of full-field decommissioning services in the Gulf of Mexico shelf. The demand for P A services should grow over the mid- to long-term as the subsea tree base expands, as government regulations continue to place stronger emphasis on decommissioning aged wells worldwide (including subsea trees as well as mature dry tree wells in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico), as customers look to reduce their decommissioning obligations and as customers shift resources to renewable energy. We support the energy transition to renewable energy primarily in our Robotics segment through our services in offshore wind farm developments, primarily including subsea cable trenching and burial as well as seabed clearance and preparation services. Demand for our services in the renewable energy market is affected by various factors, including the pace of consumer shift towards renewable energy sources, global electricity demand, technological advancements that increase the generation and/or reduce the cost of renewable energy, expansion of offshore renewable energy projects to deeper water and other regions, and government subsidies for renewable energy projects. We expect growth in our renewables services as the energy market transitions to continued offshore renewable energy developments. Backlog Our backlog is represented by signed contracts. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated backlog totaled approximately 1.6 billion, of which 261 million is expected to be performed over the remainder of 2024. Our various contracts with Shell and ExxonMobil globally, our contracts with Trident Energy and Petrobras in Brazil, and our contracts with Talos in the Gulf of Mexico represented approximately 86 of our total backlog as of September 30, 2024. Backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of revenues derived from our contracts as services are often added but may sometimes be subtracted; contracts may be renegotiated, deferred, canceled and in many cases modified while in progress; and reduced rates, fines and penalties may be imposed by our customers. Furthermore, our contracts are in certain cases cancelable without penalty. If there are cancellation fees, the amount of those fees can be substantially less than amounts reflected in backlog. Outlook For the remainder of 2024 going into 2025, we expect to continue our strong performance driven by increasing demand for our decommissioning services internationally and continued growth in the offshore renewables trenching market. We expect the demand for shallow water decommissioning services in the Gulf of Mexico to remain soft in the near term but should grow over the mid- to long-term. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Financial Measures A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the SEC as a numerical measure of a company s historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that includes or excludes amounts from the most directly comparable measure under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are excluded from these measures.

 We evaluate our operating performance and financial condition based on EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt are non-GAAP financial measures that are commonly used but are not recognized accounting terms under GAAP. We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt to monitor and facilitate internal evaluation of the performance of our business operations, to facilitate external comparison of our business results to those of others in our industry, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future investments and acquisitions, to plan and evaluate operating budgets, and in certain cases, to report our results to the holders of our debt as required by our debt covenants. We believe that our measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt provide useful information to the public regarding our operating performance and ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures and may help our investors understand and compare our results to other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Other companies may calculate their measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt differently from the way we do, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, but instead are supplemental to, income from operations, net income, cash flows from operating activities, or other data prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as earnings before income taxes, net interest expense, net other income or expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Non-cash impairment losses on goodwill and other long-lived assets are also added back if applicable. To arrive at our measure of Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude gains or losses on disposition of assets, acquisition and integration costs, gains or losses related to convertible senior notes, the change in fair value of contingent consideration and the general provision (release) for current expected credit losses, if any. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales and insurance recoveries (related to property and equipment), if any. Net Debt is calculated as long-term debt including current maturities of long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. In the following reconciliations, we provide amounts as reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements unless otherwise noted. The reconciliation of our net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):

Our consolidated net revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 13 as compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting lower revenues in our Well Intervention, Shallow Water Abandonment and Production Facilities business segments, offset in part by higher revenues in our Robotics segment. Our Well Intervention revenues decreased by 19 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting a higher number of transit and mobilization days, during which period revenues and costs were deferred and not recognized. The Q4000 incurred approximately 67 days of paid mobilization and transit to West Africa and the Q7000 incurred approximately 38 days of paid mobilization and transit between contracts offshore Australia during the third quarter 2024, whereas both vessels had no transit and mobilization days during the third quarter 2023. Our Robotics revenues increased by 12 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher vessel, trenching and ROV activities during the third quarter 2024. Chartered vessel activity increased to 532 days during the third quarter 2024 as compared to 506 days during the third quarter 2023. Integrated vessel trenching decreased to 249 days during the third quarter 2024 as compared to 276 days during the third quarter 2023, and the third quarter 2024 included 92 days utilization on the i-Plough trencher on a third-party vessel and 92 days utilization on the IROV boulder grab whereas the i-Plough and IROV were idle during the third quarter 2023. Overall ROV and trencher utilization increased to 77 in the third quarter 2024 from 67 during the third quarter 2023. Our Shallow Water Abandonment revenues decreased by 18 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenues was due to lower activity levels and an overall softer Gulf of Mexico shelf market in 2024 coupled with the impact of two hurricanes affecting our operations in September 2024, resulting in lower vessel and system utilization during the third quarter 2024 as compared to the third quarter 2023, offset in part by higher pass-through revenues on the P A systems. Overall vessel utilization was 76 during the third quarter 2024 as compared to 89 during the third quarter 2023. P A systems and CT systems utilization declined to 607 days of utilization, or 25 , during the third quarter 2024 as compared to 1,531 days of utilization, or 74 , during the third quarter 2023. Our Production Facilities revenues decreased by 15 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting lower oil and gas production and prices during the third quarter 2024. Oil and gas production declined during the third quarter 2024 due to an ongoing unplanned shut-in of the Thunder Hawk wells.

 Gross Profit (Loss). Our consolidated gross profit decreased by 14.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting a reduction in profit from our Shallow Water Abandonment business segment, offset in part by an increase in profit from our Robotics segment. Our Well Intervention segment gross profit remained relatively flat despite lower revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting lower revenues, offset by lower costs due in part to the deferral of transit and mobilization costs during the third quarter 2024. Our Robotics gross profit increased by 4.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher revenues during the third quarter 2024. Our Shallow Water Abandonment gross profit decreased by 18.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting lower revenues, in addition to higher costs due to an increase in lower margin pass-through activities during the third quarter 2024. Our Production Facilities gross profit decreased by 0.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting lower revenues, offset in part by lower production costs. Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration in the third quarter 2023 reflects an improvement in Helix Alliance s results during the quarter. We entered into an agreement and set the final earn-out during the fourth quarter 2023, which was paid on April 3, 2024. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were 21.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 27.8 million for the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting lower employee compensation costs. Net Interest Expense. Our net interest expense totaled 5.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.2 million for the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher debt levels and rates on our 2029 Notes in 2024 as compared to our 2026 Notes in 2023, offset in part by higher interest income on our invested cash reserves (Note 5). Other Expense, Net. Net other expense was minimal for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.3 million for the same period in 2023. Net other expense during the third quarter 2024 primarily reflects a 2.4 million increase in the value of incentive credits granted to the seller of P A equipment acquired in 2023 (Note 3), offset by foreign currency gains due to the strengthening of the British pound. Net other expense during the third quarter 2023 primarily reflects foreign currency losses related to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany debt in our U.K. entities. Income Tax Provision. Income tax provision was 9.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.3 million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 24.4 and 34.9 , respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to higher net income (Note 6).

Our consolidated net revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by 5 as compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting higher revenues in our Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities business segments, offset in part by lower revenues in our Shallow Water Abandonment segment. Our Well Intervention revenues increased by 19 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher revenues across our well intervention fleet except for the Well Enhancer . Utilization increased on the Q4000 and the Q5000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as both vessels underwent their regulatory dry docks in 2023. The Q7000 had higher utilization during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. The Seawell s contract in the western Mediterranean, which completed in June 2024, has provided higher rates and utilization during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The Well Enhancer in the North Sea had lower utilization as compared to the prior year period as the vessel underwent a scheduled dry dock during the first quarter 2024. Our Robotics revenues increased by 11 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher chartered vessel days and trenching and ROV activities. Chartered vessel activity increased to 1,393 days during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1,236 days during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, although chartered vessel days in the first quarter 2024 included approximately 64 days of standby utilization at reduced rates. Overall ROV and trencher utilization increased to 70 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 60 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and included 566 days of integrated vessel trenching in 2024 as compared to 536 days in 2023. Our Shallow Water Abandonment revenues decreased by 30 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenues was due to lower activity levels and an overall softer Gulf of Mexico shelf market in 2024, resulting in lower vessel and system utilization during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Overall vessel utilization was 59 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 75 during the same period in 2023. P A systems and CT systems achieved 1,865 days of utilization, or 26 , during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4,362 days of utilization, or 74 , during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Our Production Facilities revenues increased by 3 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher oil and gas production and lower number of shut-in days. Gross Profit (Loss). Our consolidated gross profit increased by 9.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting increased profits from our Well Intervention and Robotics business segments, offset in part by losses from our Shallow Water Abandonment and Production Facilities segments. Our Well Intervention segment gross profit increased by 54.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher segment revenues and increased activity levels. Our Robotics gross profit increased by 16.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher revenues and higher profit margin projects during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Our Shallow Water Abandonment gross profit decreased by 55.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting lower segment revenues. Our Production Facilities gross profit decreased by 6.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting well workover costs of approximately 8.6 million related to the Thunder Hawk wells during the first quarter 2024, offset in part by higher segment revenues. Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 reflects an improvement in Helix Alliance s results during the first half 2023. We entered into an agreement and set the final earn-out during the fourth quarter 2023, which was paid on April 3, 2024. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were 64.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 71.5 million for the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting lower employee compensation costs. Net Interest Expense. Our net interest expense totaled 17.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.6 million for the same period in 2023, primarily reflecting higher debt levels and rates on our 2029 Notes in 2024 as compared to our 2026 Notes in 2023, offset in part by higher interest income on our invested cash reserves (Note 5). Losses Related to Convertible Senior Notes. The 20.9 million loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was associated with the retirement of our 2026 Notes (Note 5). Other Expense, Net. Net other expense was 2.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10.6 million for the same period in 2023. Net other expense during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects a 2.4 million increase in the value of incentive credits granted to the seller of P A equipment acquired in 2023 (Note 3). Net other expense during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects foreign currency losses related to the devaluation of the Nigerian naira on our naira cash holdings, offset in part by foreign currency gains related U.S. dollar denominated intercompany debt in our U.K. entities. Income Tax Provision. Income tax provision was 22.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9.6 million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rates for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 38.8 and 35.5 , respectively. The increase in effective tax rates was primarily attributable to the non-deductibility of certain losses associated with the 2026 Notes Redemptions, which was characterized as a discrete event and reported in the first quarter 2024 (Note 6). LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Financial Condition and Liquidity The following table presents certain information useful in the analysis of our financial condition and liquidity (in thousands): 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Net working capital 390,718 249,223 Long-term debt (excluding current maturities) 305,487 313,430 Liquidity 398,833 431,471 Net Working Capital Net working capital is equal to current assets minus current liabilities and includes cash and cash equivalents, current maturities of long-term debt and current operating lease liabilities. Net working capital measures short-term liquidity and is important for predicting cash flow and debt requirements. Net working capital at December 31, 2023 included 85.0 million of Alliance earn-out consideration that was paid in cash on April 3, 2024. 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 Long-Term Debt Long-term debt in the table above includes our MARAD Debt, the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes and excludes current maturities of 9.2 million at September 30, 2024 and 48.3 million at December 31, 2023, and is net of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs. See Note 5 for information relating to our long-term debt. Liquidity We define liquidity as cash and cash equivalents plus available capacity under our credit facility. Our liquidity at September 30, 2024 included 324.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and 74.7 million of available borrowing capacity under the Amended ABL Facility (Note 5). Our liquidity at December 31, 2023 included 332.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and 99.3 million of available borrowing capacity under the Amended ABL Facility. The reduction in availability on the Amended ABL Facility was attributable to higher letter of credit usage due to the Nigeria project on the Q4000 . In the current market environment, we expect strong ongoing operating performance and cash flows. We believe that our cash on hand, internally generated cash flows and availability under the Amended ABL Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and expected capital spending, service our debt and other obligations, and execute our share repurchase program over at least the next 12 months. We currently do not anticipate borrowing under the Amended ABL Facility other than for the issuance of letters of credit. We expect lower levels of availability on the Amended ABL Facility while the Q4000 performs work in Nigeria due to fewer eligible receivables and higher letter of credit usage. A period of weak industry activity may make it difficult to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our debt agreements. Our failure to comply with the covenants and other restrictions could lead to an event of default. Decreases in our borrowing base may limit our ability to fully access the Amended ABL Facility. Cash Flows The following table provides summary data from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 108,051 57,720 Investing activities (10,317) (15,800) Financing activities (105,574) (51,375) Operating Activities The increase in our operating cash flows for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily reflects higher operating income, lower regulatory recertification costs for our vessels and systems and lower working capital outflows. Operating cash outflows during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 included 58.3 million of the 85.0 million earn-out payment on April 3, 2024, representing the amount in the excess of the 26.7 million initial fair value of earn-out consideration at the Alliance acquisition date. Regulatory recertification spend on our vessels and systems were 29.2 million and 59.2 million, respectively, during the comparable year over year periods. Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower capital expenditures. 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 Financing Activities Net cash outflows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflect the final retirement of our 2026 Notes and the earn-out payment. Cash outflows in 2024 included 60.7 million related to the 2026 Notes, 26.7 million of the 85.0 million earn-out payment, 10.2 million in repurchases of our common stock under the 2023 Repurchase Program and the principal repayment of 8.7 million related to the MARAD Debt, offset in part by 4.4 million of cash inflows from the proportionate settlement of the 2026 Capped Calls. Net cash outflows from financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflect 12.0 million in repurchases of our common stock under the 2023 Repurchase Program, the principal repayment of 8.3 million related to the MARAD Debt and 30.4 million related to the 2023 Notes (Note 5). Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements include our obligations to repay our long-term debt, satisfy other contractual cash commitments and fund other obligations. Long-term debt and other contractual commitments The following table summarizes (in thousands) the principal amount of our long-term debt and related debt service costs as well as other contractual commitments, which include commitments for property and equipment and operating lease obligations, as of September 30, 2024 and the portions of those amounts that are short-term (due in less than one year) and long-term (due in one year or greater) based on their stated maturities. Our property and equipment commitments include contractually committed amounts to purchase and service certain property and equipment (inclusive of commitments related to regulatory recertification and dry dock as discussed below) but do not include expected capital spending that is not contractually committed as of September 30, 2024. 

Total Short-Term Long-Term MARAD debt 23,831 9,186 14,645 2029 Notes 300,000 300,000 Interest related to debt 132,472 31,195 101,277 Property and equipment 18,815 18,815 Operating leases (1) 869,807 145,774 724,033 Total cash obligations 1,344,925 204,970 1,139,955 

 (1) Operating leases include vessel charters and facility and equipment leases. At September 30, 2024, our commitment related to long-term vessel charters totaled approximately 844.4 million, of which 424.1 million was related to the non-lease (services) components that are not included in operating lease liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other material cash requirements Other material cash requirements include the following: Decommissioning. We have decommissioning obligations associated with our oil and gas properties (Note 12). Those obligations, which are presented on a discounted basis on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, approximate 80.9 million (undiscounted) for Thunder Hawk Field oil and gas properties and 37.1 million (undiscounted) for Droshky oil and gas properties as of September 30, 2024, none of which is expected to be paid during the next 12 months. We are entitled to receive 30.0 million (undiscounted) from Marathon Oil as certain decommissioning obligations associated with Droshky oil and gas properties are fulfilled. Regulatory recertification and dry dock. Our vessels and systems are subject to certain regulatory recertification requirements that must be satisfied in order for the vessels and systems to operate. Recertification may require dry dock and other compliance costs on a periodic basis, usually every 30 months. Although the amount and timing of these costs may vary and are dependent on the timing of the certification renewal period, they generally range between 0.2 million to 15.0 million per vessel and 0.5 million to 5.0 million per system.

Table of Contents 
 We expect the sources of funds to satisfy our material cash requirements to primarily come from our ongoing operations and existing cash on hand, but may also come from availability under the Amended ABL Facility and access to capital markets. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, as reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes, are prepared in conformity with GAAP. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience, available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and may change over time as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. For information regarding our critical accounting estimates, see our Critical Accounting Estimates as disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a multi-national organization, we are subject to market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. Because we operate in various regions around the world, we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As such, our earnings are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates when (i) transactions are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Helix entity or (ii) the functional currency of our subsidiaries is not the U.S. dollar. In order to mitigate the effects of exchange rate risk in areas outside the U.S., we endeavor to pay a portion of our expenses in local currencies to partially offset revenues that are denominated in the same local currencies. In addition, a substantial portion of our contracts are denominated, and provide for collections from our customers, in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and changes in the exchange rates can result in translation adjustments that are reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders equity section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recorded foreign currency translation gains of 35.3 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss. Deferred taxes have not been provided on foreign currency translation adjustments as any outside stock basis differences would be realized in a tax-free manner. When currencies other than the functional currency are to be paid or received, the resulting transaction gain or loss associated with changes in the applicable foreign currency exchange rate is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of Other income (expense), net. Foreign currency gains or losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities as well as unsettled foreign currency transactions, including intercompany transactions that are not of a long-term investment nature, are also recognized as a component of Other income (expense), net. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net foreign currency gains (losses) of 2.4 million and (0.2) million, respectively, primarily related to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany debt in our U.K. entities. Interest Rate Risk. In order to minimize the risk of changes to our cash flow due to changing interest rates, we generally borrow at fixed rates, but may borrow at variable rates from time to time. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates may not affect our interest expense, but could result in changes in the fair value of the debt instrument prior to maturity and we may be at risk upon refinancing maturing debt. For variable rate debt, changes in interest rates could affect our future interest expense and cash flows. We currently have no amounts outstanding under our ABL Facility or other debt subject to floating rates. Commodity Price Risk. We are exposed to market price risks related to oil and natural gas with respect to offshore oil and gas production in our Production Facilities business. Prices are volatile and unpredictable and are dependent on many factors beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K for a list of factors affecting oil and gas prices.
