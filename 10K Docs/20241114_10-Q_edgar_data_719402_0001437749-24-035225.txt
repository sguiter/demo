 Following the Merger, the former branches of Touchstone Bank assumed in the Merger continue to operate in Virginia as Touchstone Bank, a division of First Bank, and, in North Carolina, as Touchstone Bank, a division of First Bank, Strasburg, Virginia, until the systems integration is completed in February 2025.

The combined company delivers banking services through thirty-three branch offices in Virginia and North Carolina and three loan production offices, in addition to a wide array of online banking services. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company incurred pre-tax merger costs totaling thousand.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 ): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, which is greater than five percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income by the entity s applicable statutory rate, on an annual basis. Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions that are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Lastly, the amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023 - 09 to have a material impact on its (consolidated) financial statements.

The tables above provide information about available for sale securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve consecutive months and securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for twelve consecutive months or more. Management evaluates securities to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Presently, the Company does not intend to sell any of these securities, does not expect to be required to sell these securities, and expects to recover the entire amortized cost of all the securities. 
 
 Accrued interest receivable on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity to taled thousand and thousand, respectively, at September 30, 2024 . Accrued interest on debt securities is included in accrued interest receivable on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , there were three out of three available for sale U.S. Treasury securities, out of U.S. agency and mortgage-backed available for sale securities, and out of obligations of states and political subdivisions available for sale in an unrealized loss position. One hundred percent of the Company s investment portfolio was considered investment grade. The weighted-average re-pricing term of the portfolio was years at September 30, 2024 . One hundred percent of the Company s investment portfolio was considered investment grade at September 30, 2024 . The weighted-average re-pricing term of the portfolio was years at December 31, 2023 . The unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 in the U.S. Treasury securities portfolio, U.S. agency and mortgage-backed securities portfolio, and obligations of states and political subdivisions portfolio were related to changes in market interest rates and not credit concerns of the issuers. 
 
 On September 1, 2022, the Bank transferred securities designated as available for sale with a combined book value of million, market value of million, and unrealized loss of million, to securities designated held to maturity. The unrealized loss is being amortized monthly over the life of the securities with an increase to the carrying value of securities and a decrease to the related accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in the shareholders equity section of the Company s balance sheet. The amortization of the unrealized loss on the transferred securities tot aled million fo r the first nine months of 2024 . The securities selected for transfer had larger potential decreases in their fair market values in higher interest rate environments than most of the other securities in the available for sale portfolio and included U.S. Treasury, agency, municipal and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The securities were transferred to mitigate the potential unfavorable impact that higher market interest rates may have on the carrying value of the securities and on the related accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 
 The amortized cost and fair value of securities at September 30, 2024 by contractual maturity are shown below (in thousands). Expected maturities of mortgage-backed securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, and Community Bankers Bank stock are generally viewed as long-term investments and as restricted securities, which are carried at cost, because there is a minimal market for the stock. Therefore, when evaluating restricted securities for impairment, their value is based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. 

The composition of restricted securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows (in thousands): 

Federal Reserve Bank stock 
 Community Bankers Bank stock 

The Company also holds limited partnership investments in Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs), which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The limited partnership investments are measured as equity investments without readily determinable fair values at their cost, less any impairment. The amounts included in other assets for the limited partnership investments we re thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators Allowance for Credit Losses - HTM

Risk characteristics of each loan portfolio class that are considered by the Company include: 
 
 1 - 4 family residential mortgage loans carry risks associated with the continued creditworthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral. 

Real estate construction and land development loans carry risks that the project may not be finished according to schedule, the project may not be finished according to budget, and the value of the collateral may, at any point in time, be less than the principal amount of the loan. Construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor, who may or may not be a loan customer, may be unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure or other factors unrelated to the project. 

Other real estate loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business or a real estate project, in addition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate, because repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business or project. 

Commercial and industrial loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business because repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business. In addition, there is risk associated with the value of collateral other than real estate which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much reliability. Commercial and industrial loans also include purchased loans which could have been originated outside of the Company's market area. 

Consumer and other loans carry risks associated with the continued creditworthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral, if any. Consumer loans are typically either unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles. They are also likely to be immediately and adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, personal bankruptcy, or other changes in circumstances. Consumer and other loans also include purchased consumer loans which could have been originated outside of the Company's market area. Other loans included in this category include loans to states and political subdivisions. 

The following tables provide a summary of loan classes and an aging of past due loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to the risk grading of specified classes of loans. The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a rating to each of its loans. The loan ratings are summarized into the following categories: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. Pass rated loans include all risk rated credits other than those included in special mention, substandard, or doubtful. Loans classified as loss are charged-off. Loan officers assign risk grades to loans at origination and as renewals arise. The Bank s Credit Administration department reviews risk grades for accuracy on a quarterly basis and as credit issues arise. In addition, a certain amount of loans are reviewed each year through the Company s internal and external loan review process. A description of the general characteristics of the loan grading categories is as follows: 
 
 Pass Loans classified as pass exhibit acceptable operating trends, balance sheet trends, and liquidity. Sufficient cash flow exists to service the loan. All obligations have been paid by the borrower as agreed. 
 
 Special Mention Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the Bank s credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The Company considers all doubtful loans to be impaired and places the loan on non-accrual status. 
 
 Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectable and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted.

Collateral-Dependent Loans 
 
 The Company may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate it from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry, among other things. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The Company reevaluates the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis. The fair value of real estate collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated by appraisal services using a methodology that is consistent with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. The underlying collateral can vary based upon the type of loan. The following provides more detail about the types of collateral that secure collateral dependent loans: 
 
 Commercial real estate loans can be secured by either owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner occupied investment commercial real estate. Typically, owner occupied commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other commercial and industrial properties occupied by operating companies. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office buildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial properties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate. 
 
 Residential real estate loans are typically secured by first mortgages, and in some cases could be secured by a second mortgage. 
 Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by second mortgages on residential real estate property. 
 Consumer loans are generally secured by automobiles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and other personal property. Some consumer loans are unsecured and have no underlying collateral. 

The following table presents the amortized cost of collateral-dependent loans (in thousands):

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were allowance for credit losses on collateral-dependent loans. 

Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 
 Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. 
 In some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For the real estate loans included in the combination columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. The combination is at least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, and interest rate reduction. 
 
 The following table shows the amortized cost basis as of September 30, 2024 of the loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, disaggregated by class of loan and type of concession granted and describes the financial effect of the modifications made: 

Secured by 1-4 family residential 
 Other real estate loans 
 Commercial and industrial Payment deferral of three months 
 Total 

Secured by 1-4 family residential 
 Other real estate loans 
 Commercial and industrial Interest rate reduced by up to 4 
 Total 

During the year ended December 31, 2023 , there were loans modified due to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 
 
 Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were payment defaults of modified loans th at were modified during the previous twelve months. At September 30, 2024 the allowance for credit losses on modified loans was 1.2 million. At December 31, 2023 there was allowance for credit losses on modified loans. 
 
 Unfunded Commitments 
 
 The Company maintains a separate reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The reserve for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses in the income statement. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, utilizing the same models and approaches for the Company's other loan portfolio segments described in Note 1, as these unfunded commitments share similar risk characteristics as its loan portfolio segments. The Company has identified the unfunded portion of certain lines of credit as unconditionally cancellable credit exposures, meaning the Company can cancel the unfunded commitment at any time. No credit loss estimate is reported for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company or for undrawn amounts under such arrangements that may be drawn prior to the cancellation of the arrangement. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company recorded a thousand recovery and a thousand provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures was and thousand at September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements: 
 
 Securities available for sale 
 
 Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available (Level 1 ). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2 ). 
 
 Derivative asset/liability - cash flow hedges 
 
 Cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of the Company's cash flow hedges is determined by a third party vendor using the discounted cash flow method (Level 2 ). 
 
 The following tables present the balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands).

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
 
 The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements: 
 
 Collateral Dependent Loans with an ACLL 
 
 In accordance with ASC 326, the Company may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate it from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry, among other things. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis. The fair value of real estate collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated by appraisal services using a methodology that is consistent with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Prac tice. There was a no allowance for credit losses on collateral dependent loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned 
 
 Certain assets such as OREO are measured at fair value less cost to sell. Valuation of OREO is determined using current appraisals from independent parties, a Level 2 input. If current appraisals cannot be obtained prior to reporting dates, or if declines in value are identified after a recent appraisal is received, appraisal values are discounted, resulting in Level 3 estimates. If the Company markets the property with a realtor, estimated selling costs reduce the fair value, resulting in a valuation based on Level 3 inputs.

Accounting guidance requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the Company s overall interest rate risk. 

shares of common stock for the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards. Beginning on May 11, 2023, new equity awards granted by the Company are from the 2023 Stock Incentive Plan and not from the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. Awards are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and compensation cost equal to the fair value of the award is recognized over the vesting period. 
 
 Stock Awards 
 
 Whenever the Company deems it appropriate to grant a stock award, the recipient receives a specified number of unrestricted shares of employer stock. Stock awards may be made by the Company at its discretion without cash consideration and may be granted as settlement of a performance-based compensation award. 
 
 Compensation exp ense related to stock awards totaled thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Compensation expense related to stock awards totaled and thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 
 Restricted stock units are an award of units that correspond in number and value to a specified number of shares of employer stock which the recipient receives according to a vesting plan and distribution schedule after achieving required performance milestones or upon remaining with the employer for a particular length of time. Each restricted stock unit that vests entitles the recipient to receive one share of common stock on a specified issuance date. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024 , restricted stock units were granted to employees, with units vesting on February 15, 2024, and units subject to a two year vesting schedule with one half of the units vesting each year. The recipient does not have any stockholder rights, including voting, dividend, or liquidation rights, with respect to the shares underlying awarded restricted stock units until vesting has occurred and the recipient becomes the record holder of those shares. The unvested restricted stock units will vest on the established schedule if the employees remain employed by the Company on future vesting dates. 
 
 A summary of the activity for the Company s restricted stock units for the period indicated is presented in the following table:

interest rate swap agreements related to its outstanding junior subordinated debt. One swap agreement was related to the Company s junior subordinated debt with a redemption date of June 17, 2034, which became effective on March 17, 2020. The notional amount of the interest rate swap was million and terminates on June 17, 2034. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company pays interest quarterly at a fixed rate of and receives interest quarterly at a variable rate of the three -month term secured overnight finance rate (SOFR). The variable rate resets on each interest payment date. The other swap agreement was related to the Company s junior subordinated debt with a redemption date of October 1, 2036, which became effective on April 1, 2020. The notional amount of the interest rate swap was million and terminates on October 1, 2036. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company pays interest quarterly at a fixed rate of and receives interest quarterly at a variable rate of the three -month term SOFR. The variable rate resets on each interest payment date. 
 
 The Company entered into interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk and to manage interest expense. By entering into these agreements, the Company converted variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. Alternatively, the Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to convert fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. Interest differentials paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense. The Company designated the interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in qualifying cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of these designated hedging instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the effect of changes in interest rates on the amount of variable rate interest payments, and the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship quarterly. If the Company determines that a cash flow hedge is no longer highly effective, future changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument would be reported as earnings. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has designated cash flow hedges to manage its exposure to variability in cash flows on certain variable rate borrowings for periods that end between June 2034 and October 2036. The notional amounts of the interest rate swaps were not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss. In the event of default by a counterparty, the risk in these transactions is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates. 
 
 All interest rate swaps were entered into with counterparties that met the Company's credit standards and the agreements contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party. The Company believes that the credit risk inherent in these derivative contracts is not significant. 
 
 Unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income related to cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. When a designated hedging instrument is terminated and the hedged interest payments remain probable of occurring, any remaining unrecognized gain or loss in other comprehensive (loss) income is reclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the forecasted interest payments affect earnings. Amounts reclassified into earnings and interest receivable or payable under designated interest rate swaps are reported in interest expense. The Company does not expect any unrealized losses related to cash flow hedges to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months.

 Revenue Sources and Expense Factors 
 
 The primary source of revenue is from net interest income earned by the Bank. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense and typically represents between 70 and 80 of the Company s total revenue. Interest income is determined by the amount of interest-earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned on those assets. The Bank s interest expense is a function of the amount of interest-bearing liabilities outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid. In addition to net interest income, noninterest income is the other source of revenue for the Company. Noninterest income is derived primarily from service charges on deposits, fee income from wealth management services, and ATM and check card fees. 
 
 Primary expense categories are salaries and employee benefits, which comprised 57 of noninterest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , followed by other operating expense, which comprised 10 of noninte rest expenses. The provision for credit losses is also typically a primary expense of the Bank. The provision is determined by factors that include net charge-offs, asset quality, economic conditions, and loan growth. Changing economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, or other factors beyond the Company s control have a direct correlation with asset quality, net charge-offs, and ultimately the required provision for credit losses.

The Company estimates that it will incur additional pre-tax merger related expense s of approximately 11.5 million during the fourth quarte r of 2024 and first quarter of 2025. 
 
 Overview of Quarterly Financial Performance 
 
 Comparing the Three-Month Periods Ending September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 873 thousand to 2.2 million, or 0.36 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 3.1 million, or 0.50 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023 . Return on average assets was 0.62 and return on average equity was 7.28 for the third quarter of 2024 , compared to 0.91 and 10.96 , respectively, for the same period in 2023 . 
 
 The 873 thousand decrease in net income resulted from a 1.6 million increase in the provision for credit losses, and a 675 thousand increase in noninterest expense. These increases were partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in net interest income, a 150 thousand increase in noninterest income, and a 186 thousand decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 Net interest income increased by 1.1 million as total interest income increased by 2.8 million and was partially offset by a 1.7 million increase in total interest expense. Net interest income was positively impacted by a 99.4 million, or 8 , increase in average earning assets and an 8-basis point increase in the net interest margin to 3.43 . 
 
 Provision for credit losses increased by 1.6 million. For the third quarter of 2024 , provision for credit losses totaled 1.7 million and was comprised of a 1.7 million provision for credit losses on loans, which was partially offset by a 17 thousand recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments, and a 5 thousand recovery of credit losses on securities held-to-maturity. For the same period of 2023 , the provision for credit losses totaled 100 thousand. 
 
 Noninterest income increased by 150 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 from increases in fees for other customer services and wealth management fees. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operating income. 
 
 Noninterest expenses increased by 675 thousand and were primarily attributable to a 422 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits, a 157 thousand increase in legal and professional expense and a 128 thousand increase in equipment expense. Merger costs related to the acquisition of Touchstone totaled 219 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 , and 138 thousand of those merger costs were included in legal and professional fees. 
 
 Comparing the Nine-Month Periods Ending September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 2.6 million to 7.9 million, or 1.26 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 10.5 million, or 1.67 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023 . Return on average assets was 0.73 and return on average equity was 8.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to 1.03 and 12.57 , respectively, for the same period in 2023 . 
 
 The 2.6 million decrease in net income resulted from 2.8 million increase in total noninterest expense and a 2.9 million increase in provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in total noninterest income, a 1.5 million increase in net interest income, and a 477 thousand decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 Net interest income increased 1.5 million from a 8.4 million increase in total interest income, which was partially offset by a 6.9 million increase in total interest expense. Net interest income was positively impacted by an 88.5 million, or 7 , increase in average earning assets, which was partially offset by an 8-basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 3.36 . 
 
 Provision for credit losses increased by 2.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , provision for credit losses totaled 3.1 million and was comprised of a 3.1million provision for credit losses on loans, which was partially offset by a 42 thousand recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments, and a 3 thousand recovery of credit losses on securities held-to-maturity. For the same period of 2023 , the provision for credit losses totaled 200 thousand. 
 
 Noninterest income increased by 1.2 million primarily from a 378 thousand increase in wealth management fees and a 804 thousand increase in other operating income. The increase in other operating income was attributable to a recovery from a loan that was acquired through a business combination in 2021. The increases were partially offset by decreases in service charges on deposits, ATM and check card fees, and fees for other customer services. 
 
 Noninterest expenses increased by 2.9 million and were primarily attributable to a 1.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a 968 thousand increase in legal and professional expense, and a 252 thousand increase in equipment expense. Merger costs related to the acquisition of Touchstone totaled 790 thousand during the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 , and 700 thousand of those merger costs were included in legal and professional fees.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This report refers to the efficiency ratio, which is computed by dividing noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangibles, net gains (loss) on disposal of premises and equipment, other real estate owned (income) expense, net, and merger related expenses, by the sum of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and noninterest income. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes provides investors with important information regarding operational efficiency. Such information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as such. Management believes, however, such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance, but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP. The methodology for determining this measurement may differ among companies. The Company, in referring to its net income, is referring to income under GAAP. The components of the efficiency ratio calculation are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands).

This report also refers to net interest margin, which is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Because a portion of interest income earned by the Company is nontaxable, the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for both 2024 and 2023 is 21 . The reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, to net interest income, is reflected in the table below (in thousands).

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. Although the economics of the Company s transactions may not change, the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change.

Critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition or results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If conditions occur that differ from our assumptions, depending upon the severity of such differences, the Company s financial condition or results of operations may be materially impacted. The Company evaluates its critical accounting estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and updates them as needed. 
 The Company provides additional information on its critical accounting policies and estimates under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in its 2023 Form 10-K and in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 

Lending Policies 

There have been no material changes in the Company s lending policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 
 Net interest income represents the primary source of earnings for the Company. Net interest income equals the amount by which interest income on interest-earning assets, predominantly loans and securities, exceeds interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, other borrowings, subordinated debt, and junior subordinated debt. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, are the components that impact the level of net interest income. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets. The provision for credit losses, noninterest income, and noninterest expense are the other components that determine net income. Noninterest income and expense primarily consist of income from service charges on deposit accounts, revenue from wealth management services, ATM and check card income, revenue from other customer services, income from bank owned life insurance, and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 

Net income decreased 873 thousand to 2.2 million, or 0.36 per diluted share, for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024
 , compared to 3.1 million, or 0.50 per diluted share, for the same period in 
 2023
 . Return on average assets was 0.62 and return on average equity was 7.28 for the 
 third
 quarter of 
 2024
 , compared to 0.91 and 10.96 , respectively, for the same period in 
 2023
 . 

The 873 thousand decrease in net income resulted primarily from a 1.6 million increase in the provision for credit losses and a 675 thousand increase in noninterest expense. These increases were partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in net interest income, a 150 thousand increase in noninterest income, and a 186 thousand decrease in income tax expense. Merger-related costs totaling 219 thousand were included in noninterest expense. 

Nine Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 

Net income decreased 2.6 million to 7.9 million, or 1.26 per diluted share, for the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024
 , compared to 10.5 million, or 1.67 per diluted share, for the same period in 
 2023
 . Return on average assets was 0.73 and return on average equity was 8.84 for the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024
 , compared to 1.03 and 12.57 , respectively, for the same period in 
 2023
 . 

The 2.6 million decrease in net income resulted from a 2.8 million increase in total noninterest expense and a 2.9 million increase in provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in total noninterest income, a 1.5 million increase in net interest income, and a 477 thousand decrease in income tax expense. Merger-related costs totaling 790 thousand were included in noninterest expense. 

Net Interest Income 
 
 Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Net interest income increased 1.1 million, or 10 , to 11.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total interest income increased by 2.8 million, which was partially offset by interest expense, which increased by 1.7 million. Net interest income was positively impacted by an 8-basis point increase in the net interest margin and a 99.4 million, or 8 , increase in average earning assets. 
 
 The increase in total interest income was attributable to a 1.8 million, or 15 , increase in interest income and fees on loans and an 1.2 million increase in interest income on interest-bearing deposits in banks. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a 50-basis point increase in yield and a 5 increase in average balances compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest income on interest-bearing deposits in other banks was attributable to a 88.9 million increase in average balances compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 The increase in total interest expense was attributable to a 1.1 million increase in interest expense on deposits and a 600 thousand increase in interest expense on other borrowings. The higher interest expense on deposits resulted from a 46-basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and a 4 increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances. The increase in the cost of deposits was impacted by an increase in rates paid on deposits and a change in the composition of the deposit portfolio as lower cost deposit balances decreased, while higher cost deposit balances increased. The higher interest expense on other borrowings resulted from a 50.0 million increase in the average balance of borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank through its Bank Term Funding Program. 
 
 The net interest margin was 3.43 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.35 for the same period in the prior year as the increase in the yield on earning assets exceeded the increase in the cost of funds. When compared to the linked second quarter of 2024 , the net interest margin increased by 3-basis points as the yield on earning assets continued to increase at a similar pace as in prior quarters, while the increase in the cost of funds slowed when compared to prior quarterly periods. In December 2023, the Bank borrowed 50.0 million from the Federal Reserve Bank through its Bank Term Funding Program and invested the proceeds in interest-bearing deposit in other banks, which increased net interest income. Although net interest income increased by approximately 80 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 because of the transaction, it negatively impacted net interest margin by 11-basis points in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Nine Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Net interest income increased 1.5 million, or 5 , to 34.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total interest income increased by 8.4 million and was partially offset by interest expense, which increased by 6.9 million. Net interest income was negatively impacted by an 8-basis point decrease in the net interest margin, which was partially offset by a 88.5 million, or 13.8 , increase in average earning assets. 
 
 The increase in total interest income was attributable to a 5.9 million, or 16 , increase in interest income and fees on loans and a 2.9 million increase in interest income on interest-bearing deposits in banks. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a 52-basis point increase in yield and an 11 increase in average balance. The increase in interest income on interest-bearing deposits in other banks was attributable to a 47-basis point increase in yield and a 69.7 million increase in average balance. 
 
 The increase in total interest expense was attributable to a 5.1 million increase in interest expense on deposits and a 1.8 million increase in interest expense on other borrowings. The higher interest expense on deposits resulted from a 72-basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and a 9 increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances. The increase in the cost of deposits was impacted by an increase in rates paid on deposits and a change in the composition of the deposit portfolio as lower cost deposit balances decreased, while higher cost deposit balances increased. The higher interest expense on other borrowings resulted from a 49.9 million increase in average balances.

Table of Contents 

The net interest margin was 3.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.44 for the same period in the prior year as the increase in the cost of funds exceeded the increase in yield on earning assets. Although the net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8-basis points lower than the same period one year ago, the net interest margin has increased in recent quarterly periods. In December 2023, the Bank borrowed 50.0 million from the Federal Reserve Bank through its Bank Term Funding Program and invested the proceeds in interest-bearing deposit in other banks, which increased net interest income. Although net interest income increased, the transaction negatively impacted net interest margin by 11-basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The net interest margin has increased in recent quarterly periods as the rising cost of funds has been offset by an increase in earning asset yields.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 The provision for credit losses totaled 1.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 100 thousand for the same period of the prior year. The provision was comprised of a 1.7 million provision for credit losses on loans, which was partially offset by a 5 thousand recovery of credit losses on held-to-maturity securities and a 17 thousand recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses on loans resulted primarily from increases in the specific reserves on loans during the third quarter and an increase in the general reserve component of the allowance during the period, which resulted from an increase in projected losses from a higher projected unemployment rate on September 30, 2024 compared to one year ago. 
 
 Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 The provision for credit losses totaled 3.1 million for the nine-month period of 2024, compared to 200 thousand for the same period of the prior year. The provision was comprised of a 3.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, which was partially offset by a 3 thousand recovery for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities and a 42 thousand recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses on loans resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves on loans and an increase in the general reserve component of the allowance during the period that resulted from an increase in projected losses from a higher projected unemployment rate on September 30, 2024 compared to one year ago. 
 
 Noninterest Income 
 
 Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Noninterest income increase d 150 thousand, or 5 , to 3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 , compared to the same period of 2023 . The increase resulted primarily from increases in wealth management fees of 141 thousand and fees for other customer services of 154 thousand. The increases were offset by a decrease in other operating income of 154 thousand. 
 
 Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Total noninterest income increased 1.2 million, or 14 , to 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The increase resulted from an increase in other operating income and wealth management fees. Other operating income increased primarily from a recovery on a loan that was acquired through a business combination in a prior year. Wealth management fees increased 378 thousand primarily from an increase in assets under management and from higher market values. 
 
 Noninterest Expense 
 
 Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Noninterest expenses increa sed 675 thousand, or 7 , to 10.5 mill ion for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period one year ago. The increase was primarily attributable to a 422 thousand, or 8 , increase in salaries and employee benefits, a 157 thousand, or 36 , in crease in legal and professional fees, a 128 thousand, or 21 , increase in equipment expense, and a 58 thousand, or 28 , increase in marketing expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily from an increase in the number of employees. Legal and professio nal fees increased from weal th management advisory expense a nd legal fees from merger related expenses. Merger related costs totaled 219 thousand for the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 

Noninterest expenses increase
 d 2.9 million or 10 , to 31.0 million for the 
 nine
 -month period ended 
 September 30, 2024
 , compared to the same period one year ago. The increase was primarily attributable to a 1.6 million, or 10 , increase in salaries and employee benefits and a 968 thousand, or 80 , i ncrease in legal and professional fees and a 252 thousand, or 14 , increase in legal and professional fees. Salaries and employee benefits increased p
 rimarily from an increase in the number of employees. Legal and professional fees increased from wealth management advisory expense and legal fees from merger related expenses. Merger related costs totaled 790 thous and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

Income Taxes 
 
 Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 186 thousand for the third quarter of 2024 , compared to the same period one year ago. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 19.5 c ompared to 19.0 for the same period in 2023. The increased effective tax rate for 2024 was the result of higher non-deductible expenses and lower nontaxable income in 2024 compared to 2023. The Company s income tax expense differed from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate to pretax income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The difference was a result of net permanent tax deductions, primarily comprised of tax-exempt interest income, and income from bank owned life insurance. A more detailed discussion of the Company s tax calculation is contained in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Income tax expense decrease d 477 thousand, or 19 , f or the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 20.4 compa red with 19.3 for the same period in 2023 . Like the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the increased effective tax rate for 2024 was the result of lower nontaxable income in 2024 compared to 2023 and non-deductible merger expenses.

Financial Condition 
 
 General 
 
 Assets totaled 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 , which was an increase of 31.4 million or 2 (annualized) from December 31, 2023 . The asset composition changed during the first nine months of the year as interest-bearing deposits in banks increased by 38.4 million and loans, net of the allowance for credit losses, increased by 24.5 million, while total securities decreased by 33.4 million. 
 
 Total liabilities increased by 22.6 million during the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 , primarily from a 19.5 million or 2 (annualized) increase in total deposits from December 31, 2023 . Composition of deposits as of September 30, 2024 did not change significantly as noninterest-bearing deposits, savings and interest-bearing deposits, and time deposits increased 4.2 million, 1.8 million, and 13.6 million, respectively from December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Total s hareholders equity increased by 8.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 , primarily from a 5.1 million increase in retained earnings and a 3.3 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was attributable to lower unrealized losses in the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Retained earnings increased as 7.9 million of net income was partially offset by 2.2 million of cash dividends on common stock. The Bank's capital ratios continued to exceed the minimum capital requirements for regulatory purposes. 
 
 Loans 
 
 Loan s totaled 994.7 million at September 30, 2024 , which was a 25.3 million or 3 (annualized) increase from December 31, 2023 , and a 42.69 million, or 4 , increase over September 30, 2024 . The growth in loans over the periods did not have a significant impact on the composition of the loan portfolio. The loan portfolio was primarily comprised of loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate, loans secured by commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans, which totaled 35 , 45 , and 12 of the l oan portfolio, respectively, at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The loan portfolio includes loans that were acquired through business combinations and loans that were purchased through a third-party loan originator. Loans acquired thro ugh business combinations included unamortized discounts, net of unamortized premiums totaling 1.7 million and 1.9 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Loans purchased from a third-party that originated and serviced loans to health care professionals totaled 20.8 million as of September 30, 2024 , which included unamortized premiums totaling 6.5 milli on, compared to loans totaling 24.6 million as of December 31, 2023 , which included unamortized premiums totaling 7.9 million. 
 
 Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off generally are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances less the allowance for credit losses and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Interest income is accrued and credited to income based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method. Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, recognized over the life of the loans. 
 
 A loan s past due status is based on the contractual due date of the most delinquent payment due. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Loans greater than 90 days past due may remain on accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest. There were no loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing at September 30, 2024 compared to 370 thousand for the same period in 2023. For those loans that are carried on non-accrual status, payments are first applied to principal outstanding. A loan may be returned to accrual status if the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and there is reasonable assurance the borrower will continue to make payments as agreed. These policies are applied consistently across the loan portfolio. 
 
 All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. When a loan is returned to accrual status, interest income is recognized based on the new effective yield to maturity of the loan. 
 
 Any unsecured loan that is deemed uncollectible is charged-off in full. Any secured loan that is considered by management to be uncollectible is partially charged-off and carried at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. This charge-off policy applies to all loan segments. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 Management classifies non-performing assets as non-accrual loans and OREO. Non-performing assets totale d 6.0 million and 6.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , representing approximately 0.41 and 0.48 of total assets, respectively. Nonaccrual loans totaled 5.9 millio n and 6.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. There was 56 thousand of OREO at September 30, 2024 There was no OREO at December 31, 2023 . OREO represents real property taken by the Bank when its customers do not meet the contractual obligation of their loans, either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower and properties originally acquired for, or used in bank operations, but no longer intended to be used for that purpose. OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs, and is marketed by the Bank through brokerage channels. The Bank did not have any consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of September 30, 2024

Table of Contents 

On September 30, 2024 commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans com prised 85 and 14 of non-performing assets, respectively. Non-performing assets could increase due to other loans identified by management as potential problem loans. Other potential problem loans are defined as performing loans that possess certain risks, including the borrower s ability to pay and the collateral value securing the loan, that management has identified that may result in the loans not being repaid in accordance with their terms. Other potential problem loans totaled 2.2 million and 287 thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The amount of other potential problem loans in future periods may be dependent on economic conditions and other factors influencing a customers ability to meet their debt requirements. 
 
 The Company purchased commercial and industrial loans between October 2021 and October 2023 from a third-party finance company that originated and serviced loans to health care professionals. The finance company operated a program that historically provided credit support to the Company through, among other things, the repurchase of their loans and unamortized loan premiums when loans did not pay according to the loan agreements. On September 30, 2024 , loans purchased from the finance company totaled 20.8 million, which was comprised of 14.3 million of loan balances and unamortized premiums totaling 6.5 million. As of September 30, 2024 , 2.9 million of these loans were non-accrual including premiums totaling 970 thousand and thus were individually evaluated. Specific reserves on these individually evaluated loans totaled 2.1 million and were included in the Company s allowance for credit losses on loans. The remaining 17.9 million of loans with premiums totaling 4.4 million were considered performing and were included in the calculation of the general reserve component of the allowance for credit losses. Premiums are amortized over the life of the loans using the effective interest method. On September 30, 2024 , there was a total of 163 loans purchased from the finance company included in the Company s loan portfolio with a weighted average maturity of 6.9 years. 
 
 Management believes, based upon its review and analysis, that the Bank has sufficient reserves to cover losses inherent within the loan portfolio. For each period presented, the provision for credit losses charged to expense was based on management s judgment after taking into consideration all factors connected with the collectability of the existing portfolio. Management considers economic conditions, historical losses, past due percentages, internally generated loan quality reports, and other relevant factors when evaluating the loan portfolio. There can be no assurance, however, that an additional provision for credit losses will not be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the qualitative factors underlying management s estimates and judgments, changes in accounting standards, adverse developments in the economy, on a national basis or in the Company s market area, loan growth, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. For further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses, see Critical Accounting Policies above. 
 
 Securities 
 
 The securities portfolio plays a primary role in the management of the Company s interest rate sensitivity and serves as a source of liquidity. The portfolio is used as needed to meet collateral requirements, such as those related to secure public deposits and balances with the Reserve Bank. The investment portfolio consists of held to maturity, available for sale, and restricted securities. Securities are classified as available for sale or held to maturity based on the Company s investment strategy and management s assessment of the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. If management has the intent and the Company has the ability at the time of purchase to hold the investment securities to maturity, they are classified as investment securities held to maturity and are stated at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method. Investment securities which the Company may not hold to maturity are classified as investment securities available for sale, as management has the intent and ability to hold such investment securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Securities available for sale may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, general liquidity needs and other similar factors and are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gain (or loss) in the value of the investment reported within the stockholders equity. Restricted securities, including Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, and Community Bankers Bank stock, are generally viewed as long-term investments because there is minimal market for the stock and are carried at cost. 
 
 On September 30, 2024 securities totale d 269.6 million, a decrease of 33.6 million, or 11 annualized, from 303.2 million at December 31, 2023 . Investment securities are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency and mortgage-backed securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, and restricted securities. As of September 30, 2024 , neither the Company nor the Bank held any derivative financial instruments in their respective investment security portfolios. Gross unrealized gains in the available for sale portfolio totaled 65 thousand and 61 thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Gross unrealized losses in the available for sale portfolio totaled 17.3 million and 20.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Gross unrealized gains in the held to maturity portfolio totaled 108 thousand and 107 thousand at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Gross unrealized losses in the held to maturity portfolio totaled 7.8 million and 10.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The change in the unrealized gains and losses of investment securities from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was related to changes in market interest rates and was not related to credit concerns of the issuers. 
 
 On September 1, 2022, the Bank transferred 24 securities designated as available for sale with a combined book value of 82.2 million, market value of 74.4 million, and an unrealized loss of 7.8 million, to securities designated held to maturity. The unrealized loss is being amortized monthly over the life of the securities with an increase to the carrying value of securities and a decrease to the related accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included in the shareholders equity section of the Company s balance sheet. The amortization of the unrealized loss on the transferred securities tota led 1.0 million, or 791 tho usand net of tax, for the first nine months of 2024. Securities designated as held to maturity are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost, while securities designated as available for sale are carried at fair market value. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 Deposits total ed 1.3 bill ion on September 30, 2024, which was a 20 million increase from December 31, 2023 , and a 18.1 million, or 1 , increase from September 30, 2023 . Noninterest-bearing deposits, savings and interest-bearing deposits, and time deposits, totaled 31 , 53 , and 16 , of total deposits, respe ctively on September 30, 2024, compared to 31 , 54 , and 15 on December 31, 2023 , and 33 , 52 , and 15 , on September 30, 2023. The composition of the deposit portfolio remained largely consistent with the prior period. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity sources available to the Bank, including interest-bearing deposits in banks, unpledged securities available for sale, at fair value, unpledged securities held-to-maturity, at par, eligible to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank through its Bank Term Funding Program, and avai lable lines of credit totaled 499.1 million on September 30, 2024 and 532.1 million on September 30, 2023 . 
 
 The Bank maintains liquidity to fund loan growth and to meet potential demand from deposit customers, including potential volat ile deposits. The estimated amount of uninsured customer deposits totaled 400.1 on September 30, 2024 , 368.2 million on December 31, 2023 , and 346.9 million on September 30, 2023 . Excluding municipal deposits, the estimated amount of uninsured customer deposits totaled 322.6 on September 30, 2024 , 293.7 million on December 31, 2023 , and 268.4 million on September 30, 2023.

Capital Resources 
 
 The adequacy of the Company s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to the size, composition, and quality of the Company s asset and liability levels and consistent with regulatory requirements and industry standards. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and absorb potential losses. The Company meets eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and is not obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. 
 
 The Bank is subject to capital rules adopted by federal bank regulators that implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee), and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 
 The minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bank under the final rules are as follows: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 ; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 ; a total capital ratio of 8 ; and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 for all institutions. There is also a capital conservation buffer, which is 2.5 above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. If capital levels fall below the required minimum ratios plus the buffer, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This results in the following minimum capital ratios required to exceed the buffer: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 , and a total capital ratio of 10.5 . Management believes, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject, including the capital conservation buffer. 
 
 The following table shows the Bank s regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2024:

 Calculated by subtracting the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements from the Company s actual ratio for Common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total risk based capital. The lowest of the three measures represents the Bank s capital conservation buffer ratio. 

The prompt corrective action framework is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 ; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8 ; a total capital ratio of 10 ; and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 . The Bank met the requirements to qualify as "well capitalized" as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

Contractual Obligations 
 
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company, through the Bank, is a party to credit related financial instruments with risk not reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Bank s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Bank follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 
 
 Commitments to extend credit, which amounted to 212.9 million at September 30, 2024, an d 171.9 million at September 30, 2023, are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Bank, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 
 Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines, and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are collateralized as deemed necessary and may or may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Bank is committed. 
 
 Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Essentially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank ha d 15.3 million and 17.6 m illion in outstanding standby letters of credit, respectively. 
 
 On April 21, 2020, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements related to its outstanding junior subordinated debt. The Company uses derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a common notional principal amount and maturity date with no exchange of underlying principal amounts. 
 
 The interest rate swaps qualified and are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company s cash flow hedges effectively modify the Company s exposure to interest rate risk by converting variable rates of interest on 9.0 million of the Company s junior subordinated debt to fixed rates of interest. The cash flow hedges end and the junior subordinated debt matures between June 2034 and October 2036. The cash flow hedges total notional amount is 9.0 million. At September 30, 2024 , the cash flow hedges had a fair value of 2.3 million, which is recorded in other assets. The net gain/loss on the cash flow hedges is recognized as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The Company s derivative financial instruments a re described more fully in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Not required. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods required by the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on and as of the date of such evaluation, the aforementioned officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 The Company s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adeq uate internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of it that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 There are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company s business, to which the Company is a party or to which the property of the Company is subject. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Except for the following risks related to the acquisition of Touchstone, there were no material changes to the Company s risk factors as disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Risks Related to the Acquisition of Touchstone 
 
 Combining Touchstone into the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than we expect. 
 
 The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the Company s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of Touchstone into the business of the Company without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of Touchstone or the Company. If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 
 The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the Company s ability to successfully combine the businesses of the Company and Touchstone. To realize these anticipated benefits, the Company will integrate Touchstone s business into its own. The integration process in the Merger could result in the disruption of ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that affect adversely the Company s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. If the Company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause the Company to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits from Touchstone or the Bank, or other unintended consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition after the Merger. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company for an indeterminate period after consummation of the Merger. 
 
 The Company may not be able to effectively integrate the operations of Touchstone into the Bank. 
 
 The future operating performance of the Company and the Bank will depend, in part, on the success of the merger of Touchstone with and into the Bank. The success of the subsidiary bank merger will, in turn, depend on a number of factors, including the Company s ability to (i) integrate the operations and branches of Touchstone and the Bank, (ii) retain the deposits and customers of Touchstone and the Bank, (iii) control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from the Merger in a manner that enables the combined bank to improve its overall operating efficiencies, and (iv) retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of Touchstone into the operations of the Bank, and reduce overlapping bank personnel. The integration of Touchstone and the Bank will require the dedication of the time and resources of the Bank s management and may temporarily distract management s attention from the day-to-day business of the Bank. If the Bank is unable to successfully integrate Touchstone, the Bank may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs.
