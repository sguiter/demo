 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements. You should review the disclosure under the heading Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the 2023 Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. OVERVIEW Scorpius Holdings, Inc. is a contract development and manufacturing organization CDMO that provides process development and biomanufacturing services to support the biomanufacturing needs of third parties who use its biomanufacturing capacity as a fee-for-service model through our subsidiary, Scorpius Biomanufacturing, Inc. (formerly known as Scorpion Biological Services, Inc.). Scorpius couples CGMP biomanufacturing and quality control expertise with cutting edge capabilities in immunoassays, molecular assays, and bioanalytical methods to support cell- and gene-based therapies as well as large molecule biologics using American-made equipment, reagents, and materials. We anticipate the prioritization of Scorpius on American-made equipment, reagents, and materials paired with domestic sourcing of biomanufacturing expertise will make us competitive for U.S. government contracts and biodefense assets. We anticipate this will successfully support our expansion within the growing CDMO market. We commenced operations of the leased San Antonio facility in September 2022 and have enhanced our in-house development of bioanalytic, process development and manufacturing capabilities and offer such services to third parties for fees. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these new operations. We intend to meet our financing needs for the operations of the facility through multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, cash on hand, grant funding and incentives, additional equity financings, debt financings, equipment sales leasebacks, and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations, and additional revenue from our CDMO biomanufacturing facility. Recent Developments On August 19, 2024, we consummated a public offering (the August Offering of 2,428,000 shares of common stock and 11,947,000 pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 11,947,000 shares of common stock PFWs ), including 1,875,000 option pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,875,000 shares of common stock Option PFWs for a purchase price of 1.00 per share of common stock, a purchase price of 0.9998 per PFW, and an exercise price of 0.0002 per PFW and Option PFW resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 14.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. Each PFW and Option PFW is exercisable for one share of common stock. On July 30, 2024, we entered into a Note Cancellation and Amendment to Asset and Equity Interests Purchase Agreement of that certain 1 non-convertible promissory note, dated May 1, 2024, in the principal amount of 750,000 (the Note ), issued by us to Elusys Holdings Inc., a company controlled by our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Jeffrey Wolf, and an amendment to the Asset and Equity Interests Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2023, by and between Elusys Holdings and us. Pursuant to the Amendment the Note was cancelled in exchange for an amendment to the Asset and Equity Interests Purchase Agreement which eliminates the payment of any royalty fees by Elusys Holdings to us and instead provides a cash payment to us of 2.5 million on or prior to December 31, 2028. On July 17, 2024, we effected a 1-for-200 reverse stock split, (the Reverse Stock Split ), which was approved by our stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting held on July 15, 2024. As a result of the 1-for-200 Reverse Stock Split, each 200

 pre-split shares of common stock outstanding automatically combined into one new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding shares of common stock was reduced from 98,827,831 shares to 494,138 shares (subject to rounding of fractional shares, which was paid in cash). Proportional adjustments were also made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of our outstanding equity awards and warrants, as well as the applicable exercise price. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as "critical" because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used, which would have resulted in different financial results. Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and make various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue and Deferred Revenue Process development revenue generally represents revenue from services associated with the custom development of a manufacturing process and analytical methods for a customer s product. CGMP manufacturing revenue generally represents custom development of customer's drug product originating from microbial fermentation or mammalian cell culture manufacturing batch processing. CDMO customer contracts often, but not always, contain multiple services from the comprehensive range of services available. Each identified promise is evaluated to determine whether it meets the criteria to be distinct. A promise that is determined to be distinct is considered a performance obligation. Any promises not determined to be distinct are combined with one or more other promises and reevaluated until a combined group of promises meets the criteria to be distinct. The transaction price for services provided under the Company s contracts reflects its best estimate of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for providing goods and services to the Company s customers. In determining the transaction price, the Company also considers the different sources of variable consideration including, but not limited to, discounts, credits, refunds, price concessions or other similar items. The Company has included in the transaction price some or all of an amount of variable consideration, utilizing the most likely method, only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The actual amount of consideration ultimately received may differ. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates transaction price to each performance obligation identified in a contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. If observable standalone selling prices are not available, the Company estimates the applicable standalone selling price based on the pricing of other comparable services or on a price that the Company believes the market is willing to pay for the applicable service.

 Under a CDMO contract, the customer owns the product details and process, which has no alternative use. CDMO projects are customized to each customer to meet its specifications, and once material enters the production process, this is considered the point where the product is considered customized under ASC 606. Further, the customer retains control of its product as the product is being created or enhanced by the Company s services and can make changes to its process or specifications upon request. Under CDMO contracts, the Company is entitled to consideration for progress to date that includes an element of profit margin. The Company recognizes CDMO revenue over time utilizing an input method by tracking the progress toward completion by measuring inputs to date relative to total estimated inputs needed to satisfy the performance obligation. Related Party Receivable The related party receivable is measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing significant unobservable inputs including the timing and amount of the expected payment and a market interest rate. Significant increases or decreases in either the expected payment amount or market interest rate or changes in the timing of expected payment would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of the asset. The related party receivable is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments , in the notes to consolidated financial statements (unaudited) included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to this critical accounting estimate. All other significant accounting policies remain unchanged and are summarized in Note 2 to our financial statements contained in our 2023 Annual Report.

On September 18, 2023, our Board approved a refocus and restructuring plan (the Plan to shed non-core assets and reduce its operating costs in order to refocus effort and resources on the CDMO and commenced the Plan which included the active marketing of Elusys. Despite the cost savings measures and the cash received in the offerings, conducted in March 2024, May 2024, and August 2024, management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are issued. We have not yet generated significant revenue from operations and do not anticipate that we will generate sufficient revenue from operations in the near term to sustain our operations through December 2024, and therefore we anticipate that we will need to raise capital to sustain our operations. Our ability to generate revenue is impacted by our cash position and our ability to purchase new raw materials necessary to perform services. As a result, management continues to evaluate our future direction, including continuing to explore strategic alternatives. However, there can be no assurance that these strategic alternatives will be successful. If we do not generate sufficient revenue from operations or does raise capital when needed or successfully engage a strategic partner in the next few months, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of its operations, sell some of our assets, cease operations, liquidate our assets, reorganize the Company, or a combination of the foregoing. Since our inception in June 2008, we have incurred significant losses and we have financed our operations with net proceeds from the private placement of our preferred stock, common stock and debt. Since our initial public offering, we have primarily financed our operations with net proceeds from the public offering of our securities and at-the market 

 33

 offerings, and to a lesser extent, the proceeds from the exercise of warrants and note issuances. In March 2024, we raised 1.2 million in capital in a public offering, in May 2024 we issued the Note for proceeds of 750,000 and raised net proceeds of 5.4 million in a public offering and in August 2024 we consummated a public offering and raised net proceeds of 13.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 277.8 million and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 254.4 million. We had net losses of 24.5 million and 41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to our CDMO business. We will need to obtain substantial additional future funding in connection with its manufacturing facility operations if we do not generate sufficient revenue from operations. However, the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: the progress of our research activities; our ability to attract customers for our CDMO services and retain current customers our ability to timely complete projects within estimated budgets the number and scope of our research programs; the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities; the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements; our expansion plans and cash needs of any new projects; and additional manufacturing facility construction costs and equipment costs. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic partners, public or private sales of our equity or debt financings, mergers, a sale of the Company, divestiture of assets, a combination of these, or other strategic transactions. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. Due to the late filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the late filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we are no longer eligible to sell securities off our Registration Statement on Form S-3, including in at-the-market transactions, until June 2025. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock, or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to raise additional funds when needed or engage a strategic partner, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our operations and we may be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets, and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the financial statements are available to be issued. To meet our capital needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, which include sales of our common stock under at-the-market offerings, if available, debt financings, equipment sales leasebacks, collaborations and other funding transactions. This is based on our current estimates, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so. Management has determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. Cash Flows Operating activities. The use of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital as well as the commencement of our Scorpius Biomanufacuturing, Inc. facility. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 September 30, 2024 was 20.7 million as compared to 30.5 million during the same period in 2023. The 9.8 million decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to decreases in net loss of 16.7 million and depreciation and amortization of 0.7 million, an increase in gain on partial extinguishment of debt of 0.6 million, and changes in deferred tax liability of 0.6 million, accounts receivable of 6.2 million, inventory of 0.7 million, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of 1.8 million, partially offset by decreases in goodwill impairment loss of 3.9 million, intangible asset impairment loss of 2.3 million, amortization of intangible asset of 1.1 million, net changes in fair value of those financial instruments measured at fair value using Level 3 unobservable inputs (contingent consideration receivable, related party, contingent earn-out receivable, related party, non-convertible promissory note payable, related party, convertible promissory note payable, related party, and related party receivable) of 0.9 million, and stock-based compensation of 1.3 million, and changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 2.7 million, grant receivable of 1.5 million, deferred revenue of 2.5 million, and accounts payable of 1.0 million. Investing activities . Net cash provided by investing activities was 2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 30.1 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease of 27.3 million is primarily due the decreased sale of short term investments, net of purchases of 29.8 million, partially offset by the sale of intellectual property license of 1.0 million, increase in the disposal of property and equipment of 0.3 million, and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of 1.2 million. Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was 22.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 25.0 million is primarily from the proceeds of our issuance of common stock, net of stock issuance cost of 20.0 million, the proceeds from the issuance of a convertible promissory note, related party of 2.3 million, the proceeds from the issuance of a non-convertible promissory note, related party of 0.8 million, and a decrease in repayment of principal on finance leases of 2.0 million. Current and Future Financing Needs We have incurred an accumulated deficit of 277.8 million through September 30, 2024. We have incurred negative cash flows from operations since we started our business. We expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to our manufacturing facility operations for Scorpius. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act filings is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that were reported in our 2023 Annual Report. The material weaknesses are further described below.

Table of Contents 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management concluded that the following material weaknesses existed as of September 30, 2024: 
 We identified ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access and segregation of duties related to certain information technology systems that support our financial reporting process. As a result, certain activity level controls were also deemed to be ineffective that are dependent on information derived from these information technology systems. In March 2023, we determined that we had made certain errors in the manner in which we recognized the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the acquisition of Elusys Therapeutics in which the net losses acquired in the transaction had been overstated in our quarterly filings for the periods ending June 30, 2022 through September 30, 2022. As a result, we determined that there were material errors in the financial statements that required a restatement of our Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2022 through September 30, 2022. This was due to the inadequate design and implementation of controls to evaluate and monitor the accounting for income taxes. We identified a material weakness related to the ineffective design of certain management review controls across a significant portion of the Company s financial statement areas, particularly with regard to the precision of the review and evidence of review procedures performed. We identified a material weakness related to the ineffective design and implementation of controls around process development revenue recognition, specifically, controls over the review of labor hours incurred and expected to be incurred in satisfaction of our performance obligations. 
 Remediation of Material Weaknesses In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we will change certain control activities over financial reporting to include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) evaluating and implementing enhanced process controls around user access management and segregation of duties, (ii) expanding the documentation over user access and system controls and enhancing the level of evidence maintained in management review controls, (iii) enhancing the design of existing controls and are implementing new controls over the accounting, processing, and recording of income tax and revenue, and (iv) the utilization of external subject matter experts to assist in accounting for non-routine, complex transactions. We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, other than the plan discussed above under Remediation of Material Weaknesses , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. The following information updates should be read in conjunction with the information disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in our 2023 Annual Report. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors and uncertainties disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. To date, we have not generated significant revenue and we do not anticipate generating significant revenue in the near future. To date, we have not generated significant revenue from our business and a significant portion of our revenue has been revenue from lines of business in which we are no longer engaged. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of approximately 24.5 million and for the year ended December 31, 2023 we had a net loss of approximately 46.8 million. We do not anticipate generating any significant revenue from the provision of CDMO services for several years as we are a new entrant into that line of business. Even if we generate significant revenue from the provision of services, which is not anticipated for several years, if at all, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable. In addition, we have entered into a new line of business, the provision of contract development and manufacturing services and no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate significant revenue as a CDMO or that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans. Financial, technological, market, or other limitations may force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans. The operation of the manufacturing facility required us to incur significant expenses before we realize any revenue from such facility. We have insufficient results for investors to use to identify historical trends. Investors should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early-stage company. Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving. We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks. If we do not generate sufficient revenue from operations, we will need to raise additional capital to support our long-term business plans and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs or commercialization efforts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities used net cash of approximately 20.7 million and as of November 14, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately 0.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, our operating activities used net cash of approximately 31.5 million and as of December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately 2.4 million. We have experienced significant losses since inception and have a significant accumulated deficit. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 277.8 million and as of December 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit totaled 254.4 million on a consolidated basis. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses to increase. We do not expect to derive significant revenue from our CDMO services until we expand our customer base. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase due to the operation of the manufacturing facility in San Antonio.

 Our current cash is anticipated to be sufficient to fund operations through November 2024. We expect that we will need additional future financing which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Unless we generate significant revenue from operations in the next month, we will need to raise additional capital before year end to fund our operations and we cannot be certain that funding will be available to us on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. Our current cash and cash equivalents, including the proceeds from our August 2024 public offering, is anticipated to be sufficient to fund operations through November 2024, unless our revenue increases from past historical revenue.To meet our financing needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, which we expect will include sales of common stock, debt financings, equipment sale leasebacks, and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by our inability to utilize a registration statement on Form S-3 to raise capital until June 2025 due to the late filing of our 2023 Annual Report, the late filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and various rules of the NYSE American that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that we may sell. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business. If we fail to raise additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to continue to maintain our listing on the NYSE American or allow us to continue operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we have to restructure the company including a work force reduction, or initiate steps to cease operations or liquidate our assets. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern . We had an accumulated deficit of 277.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and a net loss of approximately 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have an accumulated deficit of 254.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and a net loss of approximately 46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and have not generated significant revenue or positive cash flows from operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and continued losses from operations for the foreseeable future and expect our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, including proceeds from the August 2024 public offering, will not be sufficient to fund our operations through December 2024 less our revenue increases from past historical revenue. Our estimates of our runway are dependent upon our estimates of the ability of our customers to make timely payments of amounts owed to us which recently has not occurred. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we ramp up operations in our in-house bioanalytic, process development and manufacturing facility in San Antonio, TX. Our unaudited financial statement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern; however, we have incurred significant losses from operations to date and we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the financial statements are issued. Our auditors also included an explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. The various ways that we could raise capital carry potential risks. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or tests or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to complete the planned build out of our Kansas facility or develop any new product candidates that we acquire. As such, we cannot conclude that such plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report are filed with the SEC and there is uncertainty regarding our ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient revenue from operations and/or raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, it we be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its programs, any future commercialization efforts or the manufacturing services it plans to provide and may be forced to cease operations or liquidate assets. In addition to requiring additional financing, in order to successfully continue our business we will need to expand our customer base beyond the limited number of customers we currently have and there can be no assurance we will be successful in doing so. Though we continue to expand our customer base, we remain dependent on a limited number of 

 38

 customers for a substantial majority of our revenues. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 0.7 million and 2.1 million in CDMO revenue, all of which was derived from two customers who each represented over 10 of the total recognized revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue from two customers accounted for 86 of total revenue. One customer accounted for 74 of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and is migrating to a larger CDMO for commercial manufacture of their product. The loss of, or a significant reduction of business from, any of our primary customers will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation unless we are able to replace such customers with other primary customers. We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 as well as of December 31, 2023. We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 as well as of December 31, 2023. As a result, we restated our quarterly financial results for the periods ending June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022. These material weaknesses continues to exist as of September 30, 2024. In the future, we may identify additional material weaknesses or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or adequate disclosure controls and procedures, which may result in material errors in our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our period reporting obligations. Management and our Audit Committee, in consultation with BDO USA P.C. BDO ), our independent registered public accounting firm, determined that our previously issued interim financial statements included in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as of June 30, 2022, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 (collectively, the Non-Reliance Periods should no longer be relied upon. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that in light of the errors described above, a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting existed and management s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 set forth in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 had to be modified to include a material weakness in its controls over financial reporting. The material weakness identified relates to the ineffective design of management review controls over the computation and disclosure of income taxes. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The existence of one or more material weaknesses precludes a conclusion by management that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective. As a result of the material weakness, we believe that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the Non-Reliance Periods. In preparing our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that the material weakness still exists in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls were ineffective. Management is committed to the remediation of the material weakness. Management is actively engaged in the implementation of remediation efforts, as described above to address the material weakness. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements or guarantee that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could cause our investors to lose confidence in our publicly reported information, cause the market price of our stock to decline, expose us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, or impact our results of operations.

 Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American could result in a de-listing of our common stock. Our shares of common stock are currently listed on the NYSE American. On June 14, 2024, we received notice from the NYSE Regulation that it had suspended trading of our common stock on the NYSE American and determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE American as a result of its determination that we are no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide due to the low selling price of our common stock. Our common stock began trading on the OTC Markets system on June 17, 2024. On July 17, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-200, to increase the selling price of our common stock in order to regain compliance with the requirements and policies of the NYSE American. On July 29, 2024, the NYSE American notified us that it had withdrawn its delisting determination and the trading suspension of our common stock on the NYSE American was lifted on August 2, 2024. The NYSE Regulation staff determined that our common stock was now trading above the threshold of low selling price issues as further defined by Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide. However, there can be no assurance that our increased stock price resulting from the 2024 Reverse Stock Split will remain at a price that will be sufficient in order to meet any requirements and policies of the NYSE American or that our common stock will remain listed on the NYSE American. In addition, on April 17, 2024, we received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE Regulation stating that we were not in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards under the timely filing criteria included in Section 1007 of the NYSE American Company Guide due to the failure to timely file our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K by the filing due date of April 16, 2024. On May 21, 2024, we received an official notice of noncompliance from NYSE Regulation stating that we were not in compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards under the timely filing criteria included in Section 1007 of the NYSE American Company Guide due to the failure to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 by the filing due date of May 16, 2024. Upon the filing of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we received a notice that we had cured the filing delinquency. Even though the 2024 Reverse Stock Split increased the market price of our common stock, there can be no assurance that our increased stock price will remain at a price that will be sufficient in order to meet any continued requirements and policies of the NYSE American or that our common stock will remain listed on the NYSE American. The trading of our common stock resumed on the NYSE American on August 2, 2024 after we effected a reverse stock split. There can be no assurance that the increased stock price resulting from the 2024 Reverse Stock Split will be maintained in order to allow us to continue to meet any requirements and policies of the NYSE American or that our common stock will remain listed on the NYSE American. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. There were no sales of unregistered securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that were not previously disclosed in our filings with the SEC. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES. Not Applicable. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not Applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule b -1 trading arrangement or non-Rule b -1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
