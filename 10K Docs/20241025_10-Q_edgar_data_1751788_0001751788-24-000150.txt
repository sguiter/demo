 Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 Forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that are beyond Dow s control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements and speak only as of the date the statements were made. These factors include, but are not limited to: sales of Dow s products; Dow s expenses, future revenues and profitability; any global and regional economic impacts of a pandemic or other public health-related risks and events on Dow s business; any sanctions, export restrictions, supply chain disruptions or increased economic uncertainty related to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; capital requirements and need for and availability of financing; unexpected barriers in the development of technology, including with respect to Dow's contemplated capital and operating projects; Dow's ability to realize its commitment to carbon neutrality on the contemplated timeframe, including the completion and success of its integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives facility in Alberta, Canada; size of the markets for Dow s products and services and ability to compete in such markets; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; the rate and degree of market acceptance of Dow s products; significant litigation and environmental matters and related contingencies and unexpected expenses; the success of competing technologies that are or may become available; the ability to protect Dow s intellectual property in the United States and abroad; developments related to contemplated restructuring activities and proposed divestitures or acquisitions such as workforce reduction, manufacturing facility and/or asset closure and related exit and disposal activities, and the benefits and costs associated with each of the foregoing; fluctuations in energy and raw material prices; management of process safety and product stewardship; changes in relationships with Dow s significant customers and suppliers; changes in public sentiment and political leadership; increased concerns about plastics in the environment and lack of a circular economy for plastics at scale; changes in consumer preferences and demand; changes in laws and regulations, political conditions or industry development; global economic and capital markets conditions, such as inflation, market uncertainty, interest and currency exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices; business, logistics, and supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; weather events and natural disasters; disruptions in Dow s information technology networks and systems, including the impact of cyberattacks; and risks related to Dow s separation from DowDuPont Inc. such as Dow s obligation to indemnify DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and/or Corteva, Inc. for certain liabilities. 
 
 Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.

 percent and percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023). The remaining sales were primarily related to the Company's insurance operations and licensing of patents and technologies. Product sales consist of sales of the Company's products to manufacturers and distributors. The Company considers order confirmations or purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master supply agreements, to be contracts with a customer. The Company enters into licensing arrangements in which it licenses certain rights of its patents and technology to customers. Revenue from the Company s licenses for patents and technology is derived from sales-based royalties and licensing arrangements based on billing schedules established in each contract. 
 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. At September 30, 2024, the Company had unfulfilled performance obligations of million million at December 31, 2023) related to the licensing of technology. The Company expects revenue to be recognized for the remaining performance obligations over the next five years. 
 
 The Company has additional remaining performance obligations for product sales that have expected durations of one year or less, product sales of materials delivered through a pipeline for which the Company has elected the "right to invoice" practical expedient, and variable consideration attributable to royalties for licenses of patents and technology. The Company has received advance payments from customers related to long-term supply agreements that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract, with remaining contract terms that range up to years. The Company will have rights to future consideration for revenue recognized when product is delivered to the customer. These payments are included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" and "Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets.

 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets include amounts related to the Company's contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations not yet invoiced. Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are recognized in revenue when the performance obligations are met. "Contract liabilities - current" primarily reflects deferred revenue from prepayments from customers for product to be delivered in 12 months or less and royalty payments that are deferred and will be recognized in 12 months or less. "Contract liabilities - noncurrent" includes advance payments that the Company has received from customers related to long-term supply agreements and royalty payments that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract. 
 
 Revenue recognized in the first nine months of 2024 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was approximately million (approximately million in the first nine months of 2023). In the first nine months of 2024, the amount of contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was insignificant (approximately million in the first nine months of 2023).

 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs million at December 31, 2023), including million for the remediation of Superfund sites million at December 31, 2023). This is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. As new or additional information becomes available and/or certain spending trends become known, management will evaluate such information in determination of the current estimate of environmental liability. 
 
 Litigation 
 Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation 
 Each quarter, Union Carbide reviews asbestos-related claims filed, settled and dismissed, as well as average settlement and resolution costs by disease category. Union Carbide also considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as the nature of pending claims, trial experience of Union Carbide and other asbestos defendants, current spending for defense and processing costs, significant appellate rulings and legislative developments, trends in the tort system, and their respective effects on expected future resolution costs. Union Carbide's management considers these factors in conjunction with the most recent actuarial study and determines whether a change in the estimate is warranted. Based on Union Carbide's review of 2024 activity, it was determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Union Carbide s total asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims and defense and processing costs was million at September 30, 2024 million at December 31, 2023). At September 30, 2024, approximately percent of the recorded claim liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims. 
 
 Legacy Matters 
 The Company is the subject of various complaints related to alleged groundwater contamination based on decades-old sales and applications of certain agricultural chemical products ("Groundwater Matters"). The costs associated with these Groundwater Matters were previously covered by insurance policies that have since been depleted. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a study of the Groundwater Matters now deemed to be probable and estimable based on the public reporting of sampling data and historical information to develop a reasonable estimate of the cost of pending and future claims. As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge of million, included in "Cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Industrial Intermediates Infrastructure. At September 30, 2024, the total liability related to such alleged Groundwater Matters settlements was million million at December 31, 2023), which was included in Accrued and other current liabilities and "Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The Company is also the subject of other groundwater contamination complaints, including claims related to 1,4-dioxane. The Company continues to defend itself in this litigation and it has determined that the Company's exposure to liability, if any, is not probable or estimable at September 30, 2024.

 Guarantees 
 2038 
 1. In addition, TDCC has provided guarantees, in proportion to the Company's percent ownership interest, of all future interest payments that will become due on Sadara s project financing debt during the grace period, which Dow's share is estimated to be million at September 30, 2024 million at December 31, 2023). The Company does not expect to be required to perform under the guarantees. 
 
 Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, accounts receivable facilities and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of cash or other assets) if specified triggering events occur. With guarantees, such as commercial or financial contracts, non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. The majority of the Company s guarantees relate to debt of nonconsolidated affiliates, which have expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 14 years. The Company s current expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered remote. 
 
 The Company maintains accounts receivable facilities with various financial institutions, with committed and uncommitted facilities in the United States and a committed facility in Europe. Under the terms of the Programs, the Company continues to service the receivables from the customers, but retains no interest in the receivables, and remits payment to the financial institutions. The Company also has access to accounts receivable discounting facilities, under which receivables are transferred with limited recourse. The Company s maximum guaranteed liability for the accounts receivable facilities is million at September 30, 2024 million at December 31, 2023). The Company expects receivable collections and remittances to occur within the next six months.

There are no redemption restrictions and the unfunded commitments on these investments were million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 For assets classified as Level 3 measurements, fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity. The level 3 asset values represent the fair value of an investment in a corporate bond, accounted for as a debt security. At December 31, 2023, the level 3 asset values also included an investment in a limited liability company, accounted for as an investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, and with no unfunded commitment. 
 
 For liabilities classified as Level 3 measurements, fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity. The fair value of the Company s accrued liability related to the guarantee of Sadara s debt is in proportion to the Company s 35 percent ownership interest in Sadara. The estimated fair value of the guarantee was calculated using a "with" and "without" method. The fair value of the debt was calculated "with" the guarantee less the fair value of the debt "without" the guarantee. The "with" and "without" values were calculated using a discounted cash flow method based on contractual cash flows as well as projected prepayments made on the debt by Sadara.

For the first nine months of 2024, COS was 28.9 billion compared with 30.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023. COS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased on higher volume and a charge related to an arbitration settlement agreement for historical product claims from a divested business, and was partially offset by lower global energy and feedstock costs. COS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to lower raw material costs, lower global energy and feedstock costs and the impact of structural cost improvements, partially offset by increased planned maintenance turnaround spending and a charge related to an arbitration settlement agreement for historical product claims from a divested business. COS as a percentage of net sales was 90.2 percent in the third quarter of 2024 (89.4 percent in the third quarter of 2023) and 88.7 percent for the first nine months of 2024 (88.5 percent for the first nine months of 2023).

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses totaled 396 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 380 million in the third quarter of 2023. SG A expenses increased in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher bad debt expense and performance-based compensation costs. For the first nine months of 2024, SG A expenses were 1,228 million, compared with 1,216 million in the first nine months of 2023. SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 increased primarily due to higher bad debt expense, including expense incurred as a result of a resolution of a dispute with a customer, which was partially offset by the impact of structural cost improvements. 
 
 Amortization of Intangibles 
 Amortization of intangibles was 76 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 81 million in the third quarter of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, amortization of intangibles was 234 million, compared with 243 million in the first nine months of 2023. 

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Nonconsolidated Affiliates 
 The Company's share of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates was 2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with equity in losses of nonconsolidated affiliates of 7 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 9 million, primarily due to improved performance at the Kuwait joint ventures and slightly offset by lower results at the Sadara and Thai joint ventures.

 affiliates were 266 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 188 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Sundry Income (Expense) Net 
 Sundry income (expense) - net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was income of 119 million and 118 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, compared with income of 92 million and 71 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in sundry income is primarily due to higher gains on the sales of assets and investments and lower foreign currency exchange losses, which were partially offset by a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits. 
 
 Sundry income (expense) - net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was income of 256 million and 253 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, compared with income of 202 million and 169 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in sundry income is primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange losses and higher gains on the sales of assets and investments, which were partially offset by a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits. 
 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount 
 Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was 199 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 192 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was 595 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 549 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to borrowings outside of the United States and 1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, the level of income relative to tax attributes and the level of equity earnings, since most earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of 84 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.9 percent and 25.1 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of 90 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 21.6 percent and 22.5 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of 145 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 10.5 percent and 10.4 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. For the first nine months of 2023, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of 253 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.1 percent and 25.7 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company's income taxes and effective tax rates. 
 
 The Company continues to monitor and evaluate legislative developments related to the Global Anti-Base Erosion Proposal Regime ("GloBE") established by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development s ("OECD") Pillar Two framework. Several countries in which the Company operates have adopted GloBE into their legislation and several others are expected to enact these rules in the future. To date, such legislation has not materially impacted the Company's effective tax rate.

 Packaging Specialty Plastics net sales were 5,516 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 1 percent from net sales of 5,454 million in the third quarter of 2023, with local price up 1 percent and volume and currency flat. Local price increased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, primarily in EMEAI and the U.S. Canada, driven by higher pricing of polyethylene which more than offset lower pricing of downstream polymers. Local price increased in Hydrocarbons Energy, primarily in the U.S. Canada and EMEAI from third-party olefins sales. Volume increased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics due to higher demand for downstream polymers and an increase in non-recurring licensing sales, which was partially offset by lower polyethylene volumes. Volume decreased in Hydrocarbons Energy in all geographic regions, led by the U.S. Canada, primarily driven by lower third-party aromatics and energy sales. 
 
 Operating EBIT was 618 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 142 million from Operating EBIT of 476 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating EBIT increased due to lower raw material costs and higher selling prices, which more than offset the impact of an unplanned ethylene facility outage. 
 
 Packaging Specialty Plastics net sales were 16,461 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 6 percent from net sales of 17,508 million in the first nine months of 2023, with local price down 4 percent, volume down 2 percent and currency was flat. Local price decreased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics in all geographic regions, primarily driven by lower pricing of downstream polymers. Local price was flat in Hydrocarbons Energy. Volume increased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, primarily in EMEAI and the U.S. Canada, due to higher downstream polymers and polyethylene demand. Volume decreased in Hydrocarbons Energy in all geographic regions, led by EMEAI, primarily driven by higher internal derivative demand and lighter feedslate cracking. 
 
 Operating EBIT was 1,926 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 110 million from Operating EBIT of 2,036 million in the first nine months of 2023. Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, lower volumes in Hydrocarbons Energy, higher planned maintenance costs and the impact of an unplanned ethylene facility outage, which were partially offset by lower raw material, energy and feedstock costs.

 Industrial Intermediates Infrastructure net sales were 2,962 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 2 percent from net sales of 3,035 million in the third quarter of 2023, with volume down 2 percent and local price and currency flat. Volume decreased in Polyurethanes Construction Chemicals and in all geographic regions except Latin America and reflected the impact of a force majeure in methylene diphenyl diisocyanate following a third-party supplier outage in the U.S. Canada. Volume increased in Industrial Solutions, led by EMEAI and Latin America, and included the benefit of increased supply availability following the restart from an outage in 2023 related to a significant unplanned event at the Louisiana Operations Glycol-2 unit in Plaquemine, Louisiana. Local price decreased in Polyurethanes Construction Chemicals, offset by an increase in Industrial Solutions. 
 
 Operating EBIT was a loss of 53 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 74 million from Operating EBIT of 21 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to higher planned maintenance activity and lower integrated margins, partially offset by improved equity earnings at the EQUATE joint venture. 
 
 Industrial Intermediates Infrastructure net sales were 8,921 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 7 percent from net sales of 9,590 million in the first nine months of 2023, with local price down 7 percent, volume up 1 percent and an unfavorable currency impact of 1 percent. Local price decreased in both businesses and across all geographic regions. Volume increased in Polyurethanes Construction Chemicals, with gains in EMEAI and Latin America partially offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the U.S. Canada and led by building and construction and industrial applications. Volume was flat in Industrial Solutions, as increased demand for coatings and mobility applications was offset by declines in the U.S. Canada, reflecting the impact from an outage in 2023 at the Louisiana Operations Glycol-2 unit in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which successfully restarted at the end of June 2024. Currency had an unfavorable impact on sales in Polyurethanes Construction Chemicals, driven by EMEAI and Asia Pacific, and was flat in Industrial Solutions. 
 
 Operating EBIT was 41 million in the first nine months of 2024, down 68 million from Operating EBIT of 109 million in the first nine months of 2023. Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices in both businesses and an outage in 2023 at the Louisiana Operations Glycol-2 unit in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which successfully restarted at the end of June 2024, which were partially offset by lower raw material, energy and feedstock costs and improved results at the EQUATE and Sadara joint ventures.

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 2,883 million at September 30, 2024 and 2,987 million at December 31, 2023, of which 1,600 million at September 30, 2024 and 1,984 million at December 31, 2023 was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including U.S. territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, Dow makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. 
 
 Cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Dow has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the United States, which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. At September 30, 2024, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. The Company has and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its non U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations; however, these particular repatriation activities have not and are not expected to result in a significant incremental tax liability to the Company. 
 
 The Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:

Under this definition, Free Cash Flow represents the cash generated by Dow from operations after investing in its asset base. Free Cash Flow, combined with cash balances and other sources of liquidity, represents the cash available to fund obligations and provide returns to shareholders. Free Cash Flow is an integral financial measure used in the Company's financial planning process. 
 
 Operating EBITDA 
 Dow defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., "Income before income taxes") before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items.

 Cash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow from Operations to Operating EBITDA) 
 Dow defines Cash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow from Operations to Operating EBITDA) as "Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations," divided by Operating EBITDA. Management believes Cash Flow Conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the Company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash flow. 
 
 These financial measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, Dow's definitions may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies.

 Liquidity Financial Flexibility 
 The Company s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. The generation of cash from operations and the Company's ability to access capital markets is expected to meet the Company s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, contributions to pension plans, dividend distributions to stockholders, share repurchases and other needs. In addition to cash from operating activities, the Company s current liquidity sources also include TDCC's U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, committed accounts receivable facilities, a medium-term notes program, a U.S. retail note program InterNotes and other debt markets. 
 
 The Company continues to maintain a strong financial position with all of its committed credit facilities undrawn and fully available at September 30, 2024. Cash and committed and available forms of liquidity were 12.7 billion at September 30, 2024. The Company also has no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. As a well-known seasoned issuer, the Company may issue debt at any time as an additional source of liquidity. Additional details on sources of liquidity are as follows:

These letters of credit are associated with accounts receivable and the Company retains no interest in the transferred letters of credit or receivables once sold. 
 
 Accounts Receivable Discounting Facilities 
 The Company has access to accounts receivable discounting facilities, under which receivables are transferred with limited recourse.

 Debt 
 As the Company continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, management is focused on net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure), as the Company believes this is the best representation of its financial leverage at this point in time. As shown in the following table, net debt is equal to total gross debt minus "Cash and cash equivalents" and "Marketable securities."

 The Company may at any time repurchase certain debt securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to: the applicable terms under which any such debt securities were issued, certain internal approvals of the Company, and applicable laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction in which any such potential transactions might take place. This in no way obligates the Company to make any such repurchases nor should it be considered an offer to do so. 
 
 TDCC's public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. TDCC's most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.70 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement ("Revolving Credit Agreement") equals or exceeds 500 million. The ratio of TDCC's consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement was 0.44 to 1.00 at September 30, 2024. Management believes TDCC was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at September 30, 2024. For information on TDCC's debt covenants and default provisions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K.

The Company defines Operating Net Income, a non-GAAP measure, as "Net income available for Dow Inc. common stockholders," excluding the impact of significant items. The following table summarizes dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of record in 2024: 
 
 Dow Inc. Dividends Declared and Paid Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Amount (per share) February 15, 2024 February 29, 2024 March 8, 2024 0.70 April 11, 2024 May 31, 2024 June 14, 2024 0.70 August 14, 2024 August 30, 2024 September 13, 2024 0.70 October 10, 2024 November 29, 2024 December 13, 2024 0.70

 Share Repurchase Program 
 On April 13, 2022, the Dow Inc. Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to 3 billion for the repurchase of the Company's common stock, with no expiration date. The Company repurchased 94 million of its common stock in the third quarter of 2024 494 million in the first nine months of 2024). At September 30, 2024, approximately 931 million of the share repurchase program authorization remained available for repurchases. As previously announced, the Company intends to repurchase shares at a minimum to cover dilution over the cycle. The Company may from time to time expand its share repurchases beyond dilution, based on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions, free cash flow generation, and the Dow share price. Any share repurchases, when coupled with the Company's dividends, are intended to implement the long-term strategy of targeting shareholder remuneration of approximately 65 percent over the economic cycle.

 Pension Plans 
 The Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the United States and a number of other countries. The Company's funding policy is to contribute to funded plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company received a pension asset reversion of approximately 70 million (approximately 90 million in the second quarter of 2023) for a portion of the excess funding of one of its plans in Europe. These plan asset reversions are included in "Other assets and liabilities, net" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 
 As announced in 2021, all U.S. pension plans were frozen for substantially all employees who participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension programs ef fective December 31, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company spun off a portion of each of the Company s two existing tax-qualified U.S defined benefit pension plans into two new tax-qualified pension plans, which includes the tax-qualified benefit obligations for substantially all employees hired after January 1, 2008. These employees earned benefits based on a set percentage of annual pay, plus interest, and the spin of these plans provide the Company the ability to separately manage the assets and obligations of these plans with like benefits. In the second quarter of 2024, as part of its ongoing pension de-risking initiatives, the Company initiated the termination of the two new tax-qualified pension plans. As part of the plan termination process, the Company will offer participants of these plans annuity or lump sum distribution options. Final asset distributions are expected to be paid from plan assets in the fourth quarter of 2025, with minimal additional funding, if any, required from the Company, and are anticipated to result in pension settlement charges, with the amounts dependent on various factors, including interest rates, plan asset returns, annuity pricing and participant distribution elections. 
 
 See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K for additional information related to the Company's pension plans. 
 
 Restructuring 
 The actions related to the 2023 Restructuring Program are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of 60 million, primarily through the first quarter of 2025, and consist of severance and related benefit costs. Restructuring implementation costs, primarily decommissioning and demolition activities related to asset actions, and costs associated with the Company's productivity and efficiency actions, are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately 90 million, primarily through the first quarter of 2025. Restructuring implementation and efficiency costs totaled 55 million and 157 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities, which will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.

 Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation 
 Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide s premises, and Union Carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. Amchem ). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide s products.

 Asbestos-Related Claim Activity 2024 2023 Claims unresolved at Jan 1 6,367 6,873 Claims filed 3,472 3,097 Claims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved (4,469) (3,428) Claims unresolved at Sep 30 5,370 6,542 Claimants with claims against both Union Carbide and Amchem (963) (1,452) Individual claimants at Sep 30 4,407 5,090 
 
 Plaintiffs lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide s litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability. 
 
 For additional information, see Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings; and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 10-K.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
