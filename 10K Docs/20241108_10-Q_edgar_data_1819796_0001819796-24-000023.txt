Any liability related to the awards is recognized at Holdings, Holdings II or Management LLC as Holdings, Holdings II or Management LLC is the party responsible for satisfying the obligation, and is not shown in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has recorded deemed contributions to equity (deficit) from Holdings, Holdings II and Management LLC of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for partnership interest-based compensation expense which was or will ultimately be paid or settled by Holdings, Holdings II or Management LLC. 
 GCMH Equityholders have modified awards to certain individuals upon their voluntary retirement or intention to retire as employees. These awards generally include a stated target amount that, upon payment, terminates the recipient s rights to future distributions and allows for a lump sum buy-out of the awards, at the discretion of the managing member of Holdings,

 million in partnership interest-based compensation expense related to award modifications for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (other than as discussed for the Holdings Awards below) . 
 The liability associated with awards that contain a stated target has been retained by Holdings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is re-measured at each reporting date, with any corresponding changes in liability being reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense of the Company. No recipients had unvested stated target payments as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The Company recognized partnership interest-based compensation expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to profits interest awards that are in substance profit-sharing arrangements. 
 GCMH Equityholders Awards 
 In the year ended December 31, 2022, GCMH Equityholders entered into agreements that will transfer equity ownership between certain existing employee members of the GCMH Equityholders GCMH Equityholders Awards ). The GCMH Equityholders Awards will entitle recipients to receive Class A common stock upon vesting. The non-cash awards serve to transfer equity ownership from existing GCMH Equityholders to other existing member employees upon vesting. The GCMH Equityholders Awards do not dilute Class A common stockholders and do not impact cash flows of the Company. The GCMH Equityholders Awards are accounted for under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . The awards generally will vest in May 2025 and do not entitle the recipients to dividends or distributions made on Class A common stock during the vesting period. As such, the fair value of the GCMH Equityholders Awards is based on the closing price of Class A common stock on the accounting grant date less the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period. GCMH Equityholders can settle the awards at various dates after vesting by exchanging outstanding GCMH common units or by otherwise acquiring and delivering Class A common stock, and therefore the vesting of such awards will not dilute Class A common stockholders. As such, the expense that is pushed down to GCMH and the offsetting deemed contribution are each attributed solely to noncontrolling interests in GCMH, consistent with the accounting for payments to employees described above. The GCMH Equityholders Awards of units had an aggregate grant date fair value of million, or an average grant date fair value of per unit. The Company recognized partnership interest-based compensation expense related to the GCMH Equityholders Awards of million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and million for each of the nine mont hs ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested GCMH Equityholders Awards was million and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of years. 
 Holdings Awards 
 On May 9, 2023, Holdings entered into amended and restated participation certificates with existing employee members Holdings Awards ). The Holdings Awards entitle recipients to a stated percentage, or minimum allocable share, of distributions from Holdings, as well as a profits interest with respect to net sale proceeds from dispositions of Holdings properties after certain threshold distributions to other members. Pursuant to ASC 505, the Holdings Awards will be recognized as compensation expense with a corresponding deemed contribution and are accounted for under ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation as the awards have characteristics that are more akin to the risks and rewards of equity ownership in Holdings. These awards do not dilute Class A common stockholders or impact net cash flows of the Company. 
 Certain of these existing employee members were previously awarded target amounts that entitled them to a stated percentage, or minimum allocable share, of distributions from Holdings until they received a sum certain. Those target amounts represented by those sums, which were previously recorded as partnership interest-based compensation, were reduced to zero in the amended and restated participation certificates. As a result, target amounts that were previously recorded as partnership interest-based compensation were reversed, while partnership interest-based compensation associated with the amended and restated participation certificates is recorded. 
 The Holdings Awards had an aggregate grant date fair value of million, which was partially offset when recognized in expense by million target amounts reversed during the year ended December 31, 2023. The fair value of the

 year holding period, a cost of equity, a weighted average cost of capital, a volatility assumption, the likelihood of a defined conversion event, a discount for lack of marketability, and the fair value of reference properties that determine the threshold distributions for the profits interest with respect to net sale proceeds. The resulting fair value of the Holdings Awards is pushed down from Holdings to the Company and recorded as compensation expense. A portion of the Holdings Awards were vested upon grant, resulting in immediate expense recognition. The Company recognized partnership interest-based compensation expense related to the Holdings Awards of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. A portion of the Holdings Awards will vest and are being expensed over a requisite service period through December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested Holdings Awards was million and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of years.

 million equity-classified RSUs and million liability-classified RSUs with aggregate grant date fair values of million and million, respectively, to certain employees. The liability-classified RSUs are either classified as liabilities because they are required to be settled in cash or because the Company has the right to and intends to (as of the grant date or September 30, 2024, as applicable) settle the RSUs partially or wholly in cash. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reclassified million RSUs from liability-classified to equity-classified based on management s intent to settle the awards in shares of Class A common stock. 
 The majority of liability-classified awards outstanding as of December 31, 2023 were granted in October 2023, vested on March 1, 2024 and were delivered on April 15, 2024. Other awards generally vest either (a) one-third at the grant date with the remainder over in equal annual installments or (b) over a one to period. Upon delivery, the Company may withhold the number of shares to satisfy the statutory withholding tax obligation and deliver the net number of resulting shares vested.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the Risk Factors section of Part I, Item IA in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and under the Forward-Looking Statements section elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading alternative asset management solutions provider that invests across all major alternative investment strategies. We invest on a primary basis and through direct-oriented strategies, which we define as secondaries, co-investments, direct investments and seed investments. We operate customized separate accounts and commingled funds. We collaborate with our clients to invest on their behalf across the private and public markets, either through portfolios customized to meet a client s specific objectives or through specialized commingled funds that are developed to meet broad market demands for strategies and risk-return objectives. 
 We operate at scale across the full range of private markets and absolute return strategies. Private markets and absolute return strategies are primarily defined by the liquidity of the underlying securities purchased, the length of the client commitment, and the form and timing of incentive fees. For private markets strategies, clients generally commit to invest over a three-year time period and have an expected duration of seven years or more. In private markets strategies, carried interest is typically based on realized gains on liquidation of the investment. For absolute return strategies, the securities tend to be more liquid, clients have the ability to redeem assets more regularly, and performance fees can be earned on an annual basis. We offer the following investment strategies: 
 Private Equity 
 Infrastructure 
 Real Estate 
 Absolute Return Strategies 
 Alternative Credit 
 Sustainable and Impact Investing 
 Our clients include large, sophisticated, global institutional investors who rely on our investment expertise and differentiated investment access to navigate the alternatives market, but also include a growing individual investor client base. As one of the pioneers of the customized separate account solutions, we are equipped to provide investment services to clients with a wide variety of needs, internal resources and investment objectives, and our client relationships are deep and frequently span decades. 
 Trends Affecting Our Business 
 As a global alternative asset manager, our results of operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political environments, particularly in the United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East. While economic factors, such as interest rates, can make alternative investments more or less attractive relative to other asset classes, investors have increasingly gravitated towards the returns generated by alternative investments in order to meet their return objectives. In addition, increased equity market volatility can also contribute to increased investor demand for alternative strategies. Finally, the opportunities in private markets continue to expand as firms raise new funds and launch new vehicles and products to access private markets across the globe. 
 In addition to the trends discussed above, we believe the following factors, among others, will influence our future performance and results of operations: 
 Our ability to retain existing investors and attract new investors in our funds. 
 Our ability to retain existing assets under management and attract new investors in our funds is partially dependent on the extent to which investors continue to favorably see the alternative asset management industry relative to traditional publicly 
 29 

listed equity and debt securities. A decline in the pace or the size of our fundraising efforts or investments as a result of increased competition in the private markets investing environment or a shift toward public markets may impact our revenues, which are generated from management fees and incentive fees. 
 Our ability to expand our business through new lines of business and geographic markets. 
 Our ability to grow our revenue base is partially dependent upon our ability to offer additional products and services by entering into new lines of business and by entering into, or expanding our presence in, new geographic markets. Entry into certain lines of business or geographic markets or the introduction of new types of products or services may subject us to the evolving macroeconomic and regulatory environment of the various countries where we operate or in which we invest. 
 Our ability to realize investments. 
 Challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments and we may not be able to find suitable investments in which to effectively deploy capital. During periods of adverse economic conditions, such as current geopolitical turmoil abroad and elevated inflation and interest rates, our funds may have difficulty accessing financial markets, which could make it more difficult to obtain funding for additional investments and impact our ability to successfully exit positions in a timely manner. A general market downturn, a recession or a specific market dislocation may result in lower investment returns for our funds, which would adversely affect our revenues. 
 Our ability to identify suitable investment opportunities for our clients. 
 Our success largely depends on the identification and availability of suitable investment opportunities for our clients, and, in particular, the success of the investment vehicles managed by third-party investment managers in which GCM Funds invest. The availability of investment opportunities is subject to certain factors outside of our control and the control of the investment managers with which we invest for our funds, including the market environment at a given point in time. Although there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the opportunity to invest on behalf of our clients in all or a substantial portion of the investments we select, or that the size of the investment opportunities available to us will be as large as we would desire, we seek to maintain excellent relationships with investment managers of investment funds, including those in which we have previously made investments for our clients and those in which we may in the future invest, as well as sponsors of investments that might provide co-investment opportunities in portfolio companies alongside the sponsoring fund manager. Our ability to identify attractive investments and execute on those investments is dependent on a number of factors, including the general macroeconomic environment, valuation, transaction size, and expected duration of such investment opportunity. 
 Our ability to generate competitive returns. 
 The ability to attract and retain clients is partially dependent on returns we are able to deliver versus client objectives, our peers and industry benchmarks. The capital we are able to attract drives the growth of our assets under management and the management and incentive fees we earn. Similarly, in order to maintain our desired fee structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that incentivize our investors to pay our desired fee rates. 
 Our ability to comply with increasing and evolving regulatory requirements. 
 The complex and evolving regulatory and tax environment may have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to additional expenses or capital requirements, as well as restrictions on our business operations. 
 Operating Segments 
 We have determined that we operate in a single operating and reportable segment, consistent with how our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues from management fees and incentive fees, which includes carried interest and performance fees. 
 31 

Management Fees 
 Management Fees 
 We earn management fees from providing investment management services to specialized funds and customized separate account clients. Specialized funds are generally structured as partnerships or companies having multiple investors. Customized separate account clients may be structured using an affiliate-managed entity or may involve an investment management agreement between us and a single client. Certain separate account clients may have us manage assets both with full discretion over investments decisions as well as without discretion over investment decisions and may also receive access to various other advisory services the firm may provide. 
 Certain of our management fees, typically associated with our private markets strategies, are based on client commitments to those funds during an initial commitment or investment period. During this period fees may be charged on total commitments, on invested capital (capital committed to underlying investments) or on a ratable ramp-in of total commitments, which is meant to mirror typical invested capital pacing. Following the expiration or termination of such period, certain fees continue to be based on client commitments while others are based on invested assets or based on invested capital and unfunded deal commitments less returned capital or based on a fixed ramp down schedule. 
 Certain of our management fees, typically associated with absolute return strategies, are based on the NAV of those funds. Such GCM Funds either have a set fee for the entire fund or a fee scale through which clients with larger commitments pay a lower fee. 
 Management fees are determined quarterly and are more commonly billed in advance based on the management fee rate applied to the management fee base at the end of the preceding quarterly period as defined in the respective contractual agreements. 
 We provided investment management / advisory services on assets of 79.6 billion and 76.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Fund expense reimbursement revenue 
 We incur certain costs, primarily related to accounting, client reporting, investment-decision making and treasury-related expenditures, for which we receive reimbursement from the GCM Funds in connection with our performance obligations to provide investment management services. We concluded that we control the services provided and resources used before they are transferred to the customer, and therefore we act as a principal. Accordingly, the reimbursement for these costs incurred by us are presented on a gross basis within management fees. Expense reimbursements are recognized at a point in time, in the periods during which the related expenses are incurred and the reimbursements are contractually earned. 
 Incentive Fees 
 Incentive fees are based on the results of our funds, in the form of performance fees and carried interest income, which together comprise incentive fees. 
 Carried Interest 
 Carried interest is a performance-based capital allocation from a fund s limited partners earned by us in certain GCM Funds, more commonly in private markets strategies. Carried interest is typically a percentage of the profits calculated in accordance with the terms of fund agreements, certain fees and a preferred return to the fund s limited partners. Carried interest is ultimately realized when underlying investments distribute proceeds or are sold and therefore carried interest is highly susceptible to market factors, judgments, and actions of third parties that are outside of our control. 
 Agreements generally include a clawback provision that, if triggered, would require us to return up to the cumulative amount of carried interest distributed, typically net of tax, upon liquidation of those funds, if the aggregate amount paid as carried interest exceeds the amount actually due based upon the aggregate performance of each fund. We have defined the portion to be deferred as the amount of carried interest, typically net of tax, that we would be required to return if all remaining investments had no value as of the end of each reporting period. As of September 30, 2024, deferred revenue relating to constrained realized carried interest was approximately 7.1 million. 
 Assets under management that are subject to carried interest, excluding investments of the firm and our professionals from which we generally do not earn incentive fees, were approximately 44.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 32 

Performance Fees 
 We may receive performance fees from certain GCM Funds, more commonly in funds associated with absolute return strategies. Performance fees are typically a fixed percentage of investment gains, subject to loss carryforward provisions that require the recapture of any previous losses before any performance fees can be earned in the current period. Performance fees may or may not be subject to a hurdle or a preferred return, which requires that clients earn a specified minimum return before a performance fee can be assessed. These performance fees are determined based upon investment performance at the end of a specified measurement period, generally the end of the calendar year. 
 Investment returns are highly susceptible to market factors, judgments, and actions of third parties that are outside of our control. Accordingly, performance fees are variable consideration and are therefore constrained and not recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. In the event that a client redeems from one of the GCM Funds prior to the end of a measurement period, any accrued performance fee is ordinarily due and payable by such redeeming client as of the date of the redemption. 
 Assets under management that are subject to performance fees, excluding investments of the firm and our professionals from which we generally do not earn incentive fees, were approximately 13.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 Other Operating Income 
 Other operating income primarily consists of administrative fees from certain private investment vehicles where we perform a full suite of administrative functions but do not manage or advise and have no discretion over the capital. 
 Expenses 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Employee compensation and benefits primarily consists of (1) cash-based employee compensation and benefits, (2) equity-based compensation, (3) partnership interest-based compensation, (4) carried interest compensation, (5) cash-based incentive fee related compensation and (6) other non-cash compensation. Bonus and incentive fee related compensation is generally determined by our management and is discretionary taking into consideration, among other things, our financial results and the employee s performance. In addition, various individuals, including certain senior professionals have been awarded partnership interests and/or restricted stock units RSUs ). These partnership interests grant the recipient the right to certain cash distributions from GCMH Equityholders profits (to the extent such distributions are authorized) and/or to certain net sale proceeds after threshold distributions, resulting in non-cash profits interest compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense attributable to the RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Certain employees and former employees are also entitled to a portion of the carried interest and performance fees realized from certain GCM Funds, which is payable upon a realization of the carried interest or performance fees. 
 General, Administrative and Other 
 General, administrative and other consists primarily of professional fees, travel and related expenses, IT operations, communications and information services, occupancy, fund expenses, depreciation and amortization, and other costs associated with our operations. 
 Net Other Income (Expense) 
 Investment Income (Loss) 
 Investment income (loss) primarily consists of gains and losses arising from our equity method investments. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense includes interest paid and accrued on our outstanding debt, along with the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs incurred from debt issued by us, including the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility entered into by us. Interest expense also includes (1) the impact of qualifying effective cash flow hedges and (2) the amortization of realized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that initially qualified for hedge accounting and were subsequently terminated. The unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense over the original life of the swap. 
 33 

Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) consists primarily of other non-operating items, including write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs due to prepayments and refinancing of debt and interest income. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities are non-cash changes and consist of fair value adjustments related to the outstanding public and private warrants issued in connection with the Transaction. The warrant liabilities are classified as marked-to-market liabilities pursuant to ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , and the corresponding increase or decrease in value impacts our net income (loss). 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We are a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes on our share of taxable income generated by us and our subsidiaries. GCMH is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As such, income generated by GCMH flows through to its partners, and is generally not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax at the partnership level. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries generally operate as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, with certain of these entities subject to local or non-U.S. income taxes. The tax liability with respect to income attributable to noncontrolling interests in GCMH is borne by the holders of such noncontrolling interests . 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries represents the economic interests of third parties in certain consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in GCMH represents the economic interests of GCMH Equityholders in GCMH. Profits and losses, other than partnership interest-based compensation, are allocated to the noncontrolling interests in GCMH in proportion to their relative ownership interests regardless of their basis.

 Management fees increased 4.0 million, or 4 , to 98.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Private markets strategies fees increased 3.4 million, or 6 , primarily due to a 1.8 million increase in private market strategies specialized funds fees and a 1.6 million increase in private markets strategies customized separate accounts fees, both as a result of capital raising and deployment. Absolute return strategies fees increased 0.7 million, or 2 , primarily due to higher returns for certain absolute return strategies funds. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in fund expense reimbursement revenue of 0.2 million, or 5 to 3.5 million. 
 Incentive fees consisted of carried interest and performance fees. Carried interest decreased 4.9 million, or 19 , to 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower tax carry realizations related to 2023 taxable income partially offset by distributions and carry realizations during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Performance fees increased 2.1 million to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher returns for absolute return strategies funds during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Performance fees are generally determined at the end of the calendar year and are generally minimal in interim periods. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Management fees increased 13.9 million, or 5 , to 294.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Absolute return strategies fees of 111.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were generally consistent with those in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Incentive fees consisted of carried interest and performance fees. Carried interest decreased 7.3 million , or 17 , to 36.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower tax carry realizations related to 2023 taxable income partially offset by distributions and carry realizations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Performance fees increased 11.9 million to 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to fees earned from funds with fiscal year ends different than calendar year end during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Performance fees are generally determined at the end of the year and are generally minimal in interim periods. 
 Expenses 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, unaudited) Cash-based employee compensation and benefits 37,318 39,148 113,324 122,292 Equity-based compensation 3,908 3,437 34,713 33,045 Partnership interest-based compensation 13,435 14,958 55,025 89,182 Carried interest compensation 12,038 13,777 21,440 24,894 Cash-based incentive fee related compensation 6,528 4,712 15,977 7,177 Other non-cash compensation 90 381 440 915 Total employee compensation and benefits 73,317 76,413 240,919 277,505 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Employee compensation and benefits decreased 3.1 million, or 4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease was primarily driven by decreases in cash-based employee compensation and benefits, partnership interest-based compensation and carried interest compensation, partially offset by an increase in cash-based incentive fee related compensation. Cash-based employee compensation and benefits decreased 1.8 million, or 5 , primarily due to lower bonus accruals. Partnership i nterest-based compensation decreased 1.5 million, or 10 , primarily due to lower expense recorded for the Holdings Awards during the three months ended 
 36 

September 30, 2024 (as further described in Note 9 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 2 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). These awards do not dilute Class A common stockholders or impact our net cash flows. Carried interest compensation decreased 1.7 million, or 13 , primarily due to lower realized carried interest during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cash-based incentive fee related compensation increased 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher performance fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Employee compensation and benefits decreased 36.6 million , or 13 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease was primarily driven by decreases in partnership interest-based compensation, cash-based employee compensation and benefits and carried interest compensation , partially offset by an increase in cash-based incentive fee related compensation. Partnership interest-based compensation decreased 34.2 million , or 38 , due to expense recorded for the Holdings Awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by award modifications in the first quarter of 2024 and amortization of the Holdings Awards that were granted in the second quarter of 2023. Holdings Awards are further described in Note 9 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 2 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These awards do not dilute Class A common stockholders or impact our net cash flows. Cash-based employee compensation and benefits decreased 9.0 million , or 7 , due to lower bonus accruals and severance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Carried interest compensation decreased 3.5 million , or 14 , primarily due to lower realized carried interest during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash-based incentive fee related compensation increased 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher performance fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Net Other Income (Expense) 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Investment income of 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was generally consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense of 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was generally consistent with 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was generally consistent with 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted primarily of interest income in each period. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in the fair value of the warrants from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Investment income was 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the change in value of private and public market investments. 
 Interest expense of 18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generally consistent with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 37

 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in the fair value of the warrants from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Provision for income taxes primarily reflect U.S. federal and state income taxes on our share of taxable income generated by us, as well as local and foreign income taxes of certain of the our subsidiaries. 
 Our effective tax rate was 21 and 16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 55 and (21) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively . Our overall effective tax rate was greater than the statutory rate primarily due to the portion of income allocated to the noncontrolling interest holders, including profit interest expense, as well as a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and discrete tax adjustments recorded in the periods. 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries was 0.7 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.1 million and 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to a decrease in income generated by our consolidated subsidiaries not wholly owned by us. 
 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in GCMH was 7.3 million and 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (6.0) million and (48.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in GCMH for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to a decrease in partnership-interest based compensation as described above, which was fully allocated to noncontrolling interests in GCMH and underlying performance of GCMH. 
 Fee-Paying AUM 
 FPAUM is a metric we use to measure the assets from which we earn management fees. Our FPAUM comprises the assets in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds from which we derive management fees. We classify customized separate account revenue as management fees if the client is charged an asset-based fee, which includes the vast majority of our discretionary AUM accounts. Our FPAUM for private market strategies typically represents committed, invested or scheduled capital during the investment period and invested capital following the expiration or termination of the investment period. Substantially all of our private markets strategies funds earn fees based on commitments or net invested capital, which are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation. Our FPAUM for our absolute return strategy is based on NAV, which includes impacts of any market appreciation or depreciation. 
 Our calculations of FPAUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of FPAUM is not based on any definition that is set forth in the agreements governing the customized separate accounts or specialized funds that we manage.

The ramp in schedule will result in management fees being charged on approximately 0.3 billion, 1.1 billion and 1.7 billion of such amount in the remainder of 2024, in 2025, and in 2026 and beyond, respectively. Management fees will be charged on the remaining approximately 4.8 billion of CNYFPAUM as such capital is invested, which will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of eligible investment opportunities. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 FPAUM increased 0.5 billion, or 1 , to 63.7 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to 1.1 billion of contributions and a 0.3 billion increase in market value, offset by 0.4 billion and 0.4 billion of withdrawals and distributions, respectively, and a 0.2 billion decrease in foreign exchange and other movements. 
 Private markets strategies FPAUM increased 0.5 billion, or 1 , to 42.3 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to 0.9 billion of contributions, partially offset by 0.3 billion of distributions.

 CNYFPAUM increased 0.5 billion, or 7 , to 7.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the closing of new commitments during the period, net of reductions for CNYFPAUM that became FPAUM during the period . 
 AUM increased 0.9 billion, or 1 , to 79.6 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by a 0.5 billion increase in both FPAUM and CNYFPAUM, partially offset by mark to market decreases that do not impact FPAUM. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 FPAUM increased 2.0 billion, or 3 , to 63.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to 4.2 billion of contributions and a 1.8 billion increase in market value, offset by 2.2 billion and 1.0 billion of withdrawals and distributions, respectively, and a 0.8 billion decrease for foreign exchange and other movements.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results of operations above, we report certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to assess the performance of our business across reporting periods and believes this information is useful to investors for the same reasons. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are reconciled below. Further, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these measurements in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures including revenues and net income (loss). We may calculate or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than other companies who report measures with the same or similar names, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable.

(6) Represents corporate income taxes at a blended statutory rate of 24.7 and 24.2 applied to Adjusted Pre-Tax Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 24.7 and 24.2 are based on a federal statutory rate of 21.0 and a combined state, local and foreign rate net of federal benefits of 3.7 and 3.2 , respectively. 
 Net Incentive Fees Attributable to GCM Grosvenor 
 Net incentive fees are used to highlight fees earned from incentive fees that are attributable to GCM Grosvenor. Net incentive fees represent incentive fees excluding (a) incentive fees contractually owed to others and (b) cash-based incentive fee related compensation. Net incentive fees are used by management in making compensation and capital allocation decisions and we believe that they provide investors useful information regarding the amount that such fees contribute to our earnings. 
 The following table shows reconciliations of incentive fees to net incentive fees attributable to GCM Grosvenor for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, unaudited) Incentive fees: Performance fees 2,745 661 13,078 1,174 Carried interest 20,559 25,412 36,381 43,710 Less incentive fees contractually owed to others: Cash carried interest compensation (12,038) (13,777) (21,440) (24,894) Non-cash carried interest compensation and other 1,488 (439) 1,534 (37) Carried interest attributable to other noncontrolling interest holders (883) (1,385) (1,934) (4,003) Firm share of incentive fees (1)

 (1) Firm share represents incentive fees net of contractual obligations but before discretionary cash-based incentive compensation. 
 Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures used to evaluate our profitability. 
 Adjusted Pre-Tax Income represents net income attributable to GCM Grosvenor Inc. including (a) net income (loss) attributable to GCMH, excluding (b) provision for income taxes, (c) changes in fair value of derivatives and warrant liabilities, (d) amortization expense, (e) partnership interest-based and non-cash compensation, (f) equity-based compensation, including cash-settled equity awards (as we view the cash settlement as a separate capital transaction), (g) unrealized investment income, (h) changes in TRA liability and (i) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core performance, including charges related to corporate transactions, employee severance, office relocation costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Adjusted Net Income represents Adjusted Pre-Tax Income fully taxed at each period s blended statutory tax rate. 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted Net Income excluding (a) adjusted income taxes, (b) depreciation and amortization expense and (c) interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
 We are a holding company with no material assets other than its indirect ownership of equity interests in GCMH and certain deferred tax assets. The GCMH Equityholders may from time to time cause GCMH to redeem any or all of their GCMH common units in exchange, at our election, for either cash (based on the market price for a share of the Class A common stock) or shares of Class A common stock. As such, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in GCMH is added back in order to reflect the full economics of the underlying business as if GCMH Equityholders converted their interests to shares of Class A common stock. Other noncontrolling interests do not have the ability to convert those interests into our equity interests, and as such, income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests are not adjusted for in our non-GAAP financial measures. 
 42 

We believe Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because they provide additional insight into the operating profitability of our core business across reporting periods. These measures (1) present a view of the economics of the underlying business as if GCMH Equityholders converted their interests to shares of Class A common stock and (2) adjust for certain non-cash and other activity in order to provide more comparable results of the core business across reporting periods. These measures are used by management in budgeting, forecasting and evaluating operating results.

 (3) Represents corporate income taxes at a blended statutory rate of 24.7 and 24.2 applied to Adjusted Pre-Tax Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 24.7 and 24.2 are based on a federal statutory rate of 21.0 and a combined state, local and foreign rate net of federal benefits of 3.7 and 3.2 , respectively.

Adjusted Net Income Per Share 
 Adjusted net income per share is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by adjusted shares outstanding. Adjusted shares outstanding assumes the hypothetical full exchange of limited partnership interests in GCMH into Class A common stock of GCM Grosvenor Inc., the dilution from outstanding warrants for Class A common stock of GCM Grosvenor Inc. and the dilution from outstanding equity-based compensation. We believe adjusted net income per share is useful to investors because it enables them to better evaluate per-share performance across reporting periods. 
 The following table shows a reconciliation of diluted weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding to adjusted shares outstanding used in the computation of adjusted net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts; unaudited) Adjusted Net Income Per Share Adjusted Net Income 31,434 28,427 88,032 70,769 Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - basic 45,163,779 43,467,609 44,591,650 43,189,001 Exchange of partnership units 144,235,246 144,235,246 144,235,246 144,235,246 Assumed vesting of RSUs - incremental shares under the treasury stock method 1,198,541 294,593 Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted 190,597,566 187,997,448 188,826,896 187,424,247 Effect of RSUs, if antidilutive for GAAP 1,492,538 633,208 Adjusted shares - diluted 190,597,566 187,997,448 190,319,434 188,057,455 Adjusted Net Income Per Share - Diluted 0.16 0.15 0.46 0.38 
 Fee-Related Revenue and Fee-Related Earnings 
 Fee-Related Revenue FRR is a non-GAAP measure used to highlight revenues from recurring management fees and administrative fees. FRR represents total operating rev enues less (1) incentive fees and (2) fund reimbursement revenue. We believe FRR is useful to investors because it provides additional insight into our relatively stable management fee base separate from incentive fee revenues, which tend to have greater variability. 
 Fee-Related Earnings FRE is a non-GAAP metric used to highlight earnings from recurring management fees and administrative fees. FRE represents adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude (a) incentive fees and related compensation and (b) other non-operating income, and to include depreciation expense. We believe FRE is useful to investors because it provides additional insights into the management fee driven operating profitability of our business. 
 The following table shows reconciliations of Total Operating Revenues to Fee-Related Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed our operations and working capital through net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below). As of September 30, 2024, we had 98.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity of 50.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. On July 29, 2022, the SEC declared effective our Registration Statement on Form S-3, pursuant to which we may issue a combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings from time to time. Our primary cash needs are to fund working capital requirements, invest in growing our business, make investments in GCM Funds, make scheduled principal payments and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock, and pay tax distributions to members. Additionally, as a result of the Transaction, we need cash to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect that our cash flow from operations, current cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures and to service our debt obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. 
 We are required to maintain minimum net capital balances for regulatory purposes for certain of our foreign subsidiaries as well as our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. These net capital requirements are met by retaining cash. As a result, we may be restricted in our ability to transfer cash between different operating entities and jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024 we are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. 
 Cash Flow 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands, unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities 110,674 65,389 Net cash used in investing activities (25,108) (13,031) Net cash used in financing activities (31,528) (80,947) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 55 (1,220) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 54,093 (29,809) 
 45 

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities is generally comprised of our net income (loss) in the respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activities, including equity-based compensation for equity-classified awards, non-cash partnership interest-based compensation, the change in fair value of warrant liabilities and the change in equity value of our investments, all of which are included in earnings; proceeds received from return on investments; inflows for receipt of management and incentive fees; and outflows for operating expenses, including cash-based compensation; and lease liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 110.7 million and 65.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These operating cash flows were primarily driven by: 
 net income of 98.8 million and 69.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, after adjusting for 92.6 million and 102.9 million of net non-cash activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; 
 an increase in working capital of 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a decrease in working capital of 10.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to higher receipts of management and incentive fees, partially offset by higher payments for cash-based compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; and 
 proceeds received from investments of 8.4 million and 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was (25.1) million and (13.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These investing cash flows were primarily driven by: 
 purchases of premises and equipment of (15.6) million and (1.3) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; 
 contributions/subscriptions to investments of (17.2) million and (21.1) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; partially offset by 
 distributions received from investments of 7.7 million and 9.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was (31.5) million and (80.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These financing cash flows were primarily driven by: 
 capital distributions paid to partners and member of (42.7) million and (39.0) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; 
 capital distributions paid to noncontrolling interest holders of (9.2) million and (10.5) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; 
 proceeds from the Term Loan Facility amendment of 50.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; 
 principal payments on the Term Loan Facility of (2.1) million and (3.0) million during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; 
 payments to repurchase Class A common stock of (4.5) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 
 the settlement of equity-based compensation to satisfy withholding tax requirements of (12.7) million and (10.2) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and 
 dividends paid of (15.6) million during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Indebtedness 
 On January 2, 2014, GCMH entered into a credit agreement (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement that provides GCMH with a senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan 
 46 

Facility and a 50.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities ). Under the Revolving Credit Facility, 15.0 million is available for letters of credit and 10.0 million is available for swingline loans. 
 On June 23, 2021, we amended our Term Loan Facility to increase the aggregate principal amount from 290.0 million to 400.0 million. On June 29, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 7 to the Credit Agreement to incorporate changes for the contemplated transition to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate Term SOFR ), and on July 1, 2023, in conjunction with a Benchmark Transition Event, the interest rate defaulted to the Term SOFR plus a Benchmark Replacement Adjustment as recommended by the Relevant Governmental Body (all terms as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). 
 On May 21, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 8 to the Credit Agreement, which among other things, increased the aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan Facility from 388.0 million to 438.0 million and extended the maturity date from February 24, 2028 to February 25, 2030. Additionally, the amendment reduced the interest rate margin to 2.25 over Term SOFR and removed the Benchmark Replacement Adjustment. The maturity date for the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility is February 24, 2028. 
 As of September 30, 2024, GCMH had borrowings of 436.9 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and no outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had available borrowing capacity of 50.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 See Note 11 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of our outstanding indebtedness. 
 The terms of our current debt instruments contain covenants that may restrict us and our subsidiaries from paying distributions to its members. As a holding company, we are dependent upon the ability of GCMH to make distributions to its members, including us. However, the ability of GCMH to make such distributions is subject to its operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and applicable Delaware law. These restrictions include restrictions on the payment of distributions whenever the payment of such distributions would cause GCMH to no longer be in compliance with any of its financial covenants under the Term Loan Facility. Absent an event of default under the Credit Agreement governing the terms of the Term Loan Facility, GCMH may make unlimited distributions when the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is below stated thresholds. As of September 30, 2024, the Total Leverage Ratio was below such stated thresholds and we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 See Note 12 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of our interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate risk related to our outstanding indebtedness. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into swap agreements to hedge interest rate risk related to our debt. Effective on May 31, 2024, we entered into a swap agreement to hedge interest rate risk related to payments made for the increase in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Term Loans that has a notional amount of 28.5 million and a fixed rate of 4.47 . On May 23, 2024, we entered into a forward-starting swap agreement to hedge interest rate risk related to payments made during the extended maturity of the 2030 Term Loans that has an effective date of February 24, 2028, a notional amount of 317.0 million, and a fixed rate of 4.17 . 
 Dividend Policy 
 We are a holding company with no material assets other than our indirect ownership of equity interests in GCMH and certain deferred tax assets. As such, we do not have any independent means of generating revenue. However, management of GCM Grosvenor expects to cause GCMH to make distributions to its members, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses. On November 7, 2024, GCMG s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.11 per share of Class A common stock to record holders as of the close of business on December 2, 2024 . The payment date will be December 16, 2024. The payment of cash dividends on shares of our Class A common stock in the future, in this amount or otherwise, will be within the discretion of GCMG s Board of Directors at such time. 
 Stock Repurchase Plan 
 On August 6, 2021, GCMG s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan which may be used to repurchase our outstanding Class A common stock and warrants to purchase Class A common stock. Our Class A common stock and warrants may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, including with employees or otherwise, pursuant to the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, as well as to retire (by cash settlement or the payment of tax withholding amounts upon net settlement) equity-based awards granted under our 
 47 

2020 Incentive Award Plan, as amended and restated (and any successor plan thereto), with the terms and conditions of these repurchases depending on legal requirements, price, market and economic conditions and other factors. We are not obligated under the terms of the program to repurchase any of our Class A common stock or warrants, the program has no expiration date and we may suspend or terminate the program at any time without prior notice. Any shares of Class A common stock and any warrants repurchased as part of this program will be canceled. GCMG s Board of Directors has made subsequent increases to its stock repurchase authorization for shares and warrants. As of December 31, 2023, the total authorization was 115.0 million, excluding fees and expenses. On February 8, 2024, GCMG's Board of Directors increased the firm's existing share repurchase authorization by 25 million , from 115 million to 140 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent 33.2 million to reduce Class A shares to be issued to employees, including amounts withheld to satisfy tax obligations in connection with the settlement of RSUs. No shares of Class A common stock or warrants were repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 32.0 million remained available under our stock repurchase plan. 
 We review our capital return plan on an on-going basis, considering our financial performance and liquidity position, investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives, acquisition opportunities, the economic outlook, regulatory changes and other relevant factors. As these factors may change over time, the actual amounts expended on repurchase activity, dividends, and acquisitions, if any, during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 Exchanges of Grosvenor common units by limited partners of GCMH will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the assets of GCMH and its subsidiaries that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis are expected to increase our depreciation and amortization deductions and create other tax benefits, and therefore may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The Tax Receivable Agreement requires us to pay 85 of the amount of these and certain other tax benefits, if any, that we realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) to the TRA Parties. As of September 30, 2024, the amount payable to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement was 53.8 million. 
 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 In January 2024, we executed an agreement to lease office space for our United Kingdom space. In June 2024, we amended our agreement to lease office space for our Chicago, Illinois space. See Note 13 in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of the lease payments. There are no other material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, please refer to Note 2 in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Our critical accounting policies are more fully described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on our results can be found in Note 2 in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to a broad range of risks inherent in the financial markets in which we participate, including price risk, interest-rate risk, access to and cost of financing risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and foreign exchange-rate risk. Potentially negative effects of these risks may be mitigated to a certain extent by those aspects of our investment approach, investment strategies, fundraising practices or other business activities that are designed to benefit, either in relative or absolute terms, from periods of economic weakness, tighter credit or financial market dislocations. 
 Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment manager for our funds and the sensitivity to movements in the fair value of their investments, which may adversely affect our investment income, management fees, and incentive fees, as applicable. 
 
 In May 2024, we entered into a swap agreement and a forward-starting swap agreement that have a notional amount of 28.5 million and 317.0 million, respectively, with the purpose of hedging interest rate risk related to payments made for the increase in aggregate principal amount and extended maturity of the Term Loan Facility. The swap, forward-starting swap and the Term Loan Facility have a 0.50 Term SOFR floor. The swap and forward-starting swap were determined to be effective cash flow hedges at inception based on a comparison of critical terms. See Note 12 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information about these swap agreements. 
 Based on the floating rate component of our Term Loan Facility and excluding any impact of interest rate hedges as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in SOFR would result in increased interest expense of 4.4 million over the next 12 months. 
 There have been no other material changes in our market risks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are a defendant in various lawsuits related to our business. We do not believe that the outcome of any current litigation will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition or statements of income. 
 In the normal course of business, we may enter into contracts that contain a number of representations and warranties, which may provide for general or specific indemnifications. The Company s exposure under these contracts is not currently 
 49 

known, as any such exposure would be based on future claims, which could be made against us. We are not currently aware of any such pending claims and based on our experience, we believe the risk of loss related to these arrangements to be remote.
