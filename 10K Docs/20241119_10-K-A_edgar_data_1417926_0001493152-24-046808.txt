Note 

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements, other than purely historical
information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results,
and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, 
 will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar
expressions. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained
in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor
provisions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties
which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual
effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and
future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to changes in economic conditions, legislative or regulatory changes,
availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to advance our clinical
programs and raise additional financing and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered
in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We undertake no obligation to update
or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information
concerning our business, including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in our
other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of NAYA Biosciences, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NAYA Biosciences,
Inc. (former name: INVO Bioscience, Inc.) (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered net losses from operations and has a net
capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans
regarding those matters are discussed in Note 4. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Restatement of the 2023 and 2022 Consolidated Financial
Statements 

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the accompanying 2023 and 2022 consolidated financial statements have been restated to correct for errors. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that
are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as
a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit
matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Revenue Transactions and Improper
Revenue Recognition 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in
accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods
or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those
goods or services. ASC 606 requires companies to assess their contracts to determine the timing and amount of revenue to recognize under
the revenue standard. The model has a five-step approach: 

Identify the contract with the customer. 

Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

Determine the total transaction price. 

Allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract. 

Recognize as revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. 

Auditing
management s evaluation of revenue from contracts with customers involves significant judgment, given the fact that the agreements
require management s evaluation, identification of the contract and the performance obligation, the total transaction price and
the allocation of the total transaction price, the determination of when the performance obligation is satisfied, and consideration that
revenue is an inherent fraud risk. 

To
evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the assessment by management, we evaluated management s assessment in relationship
to the relevant agreements.

 years. The Company capitalizes the expenditures
for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived
assets is measured by a comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to
generate. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value.

million and 
 million, respectively, and has an accumulated
deficit of approximately 
 million as of December 31, 2023. Approximately 
 million of the net loss was related to non-cash
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The
Company has been dependent on raising capital through debt and equity financings to meet its needs for cash used in operating and investing
activities. During 2022, the Company received proceeds of 
 million from demand notes and net proceeds of
approximately 
 million for the sale of its common stock. During 2023, the
Company received proceeds of 
 million from notes and net proceeds of approximately
 million
for the sale of its common stock. Over the next 12 months, the Company s plan includes growing the Wisconsin Fertility Institute
and pursuing additional IVF clinic acquisitions. Until the Company can generate positive cash from operations, it will need to raise
additional funding to meet its liquidity needs and to execute its business strategy. As in the past, the Company will seek debt and/or
equity financing, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 

Although
the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared under the assumption
that it would continue operations as a going concern, the report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm
that accompanies the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a going concern
qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, based
on the consolidated financial statements at that time. Specifically, as noted above, the Company has incurred significant operating losses
and the Company expects to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as it continues to ramp up the commercialization
of INVOcell and develop new INVO Centers. These prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse
effect on the Company s financial condition. If the Company cannot continue as a going concern, its stockholders would likely lose
most or all of their investment in the Company.

LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company FLOW ). WFRSA owns, operates and manages WFI s fertility practice that
provides direct treatment to patients focused on fertility, gynecology and obstetrics care and surgical procedures, and employs physicians
and other healthcare providers to deliver such services and procedures. FLOW provides WFRSA with related laboratory services. 

The Company
purchased the non-medical assets of WFRSA and one hundred percent of FLOW s membership interests. The Buyer and WFRSA entered into
a management services agreement pursuant to which WFRSA outsourced all its non-medical activities to the Buyer. 

The

the year ended December 31, 2023, WFI s results of operations are included from the acquisition date of August 10, 2023 through
December 31, 2023. The Company s consolidated financial statements reflect the preliminary purchase accounting adjustments in accordance
with ASC 805 Business Combinations , whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

within the 24-month period following the execution
of the Bloom Agreement to support the start-up operations of the Georgia JV, the Georgia JV issued 
 of its units to INVO CTR and in consideration
for Bloom s commitment to contribute physician services having an anticipated value of up to 
 over the course of a 24-month vesting period,
the Georgia JV issued 
 of its units to Bloom. 

The
responsibilities of Bloom include providing all medical services required for the operation of the Atlanta Clinic. The responsibilities
of INVO CTR include providing certain funding to the Georgia JV, lab services quality management, and providing access to and being the
exclusive provider of the INVOcell to the Georgia JV. INVO CTR also performs all required, industry specific compliance and accreditation
functions, and product documentation for product registration. 

The
Bloom Agreement provides Bloom with a profits interest in the Georgia JV and, in connection with such profits interest,
states that profits and losses be allocated to its members based on a hypothetical liquidation of the Georgia JV. In such a scenario,
liquidation proceeds would be distributed in the following order: (a) to INVO CTR until the difference between its capital contributions
and distributions (the Hurdle Amount equals ;
(b) to Bloom until its distributions equal 
of the liquidation amounts distributed to INVO CTR (a catch-up to rebalance the distributions between members); and (c)
thereafter on a pro rata basis. The Georgia JV had no assets or liabilities at the time the units were issued, and, as of December 31,
2023, INVO CTR had made capital contributions greater than the net loss of the Georgia JV. As such, the entire net loss was allocated
to INVO CTR, and no loss was allocated to the noncontrolling interest of Bloom. 

The
Georgia JV opened to patients on September 7, 2021. 

The
Company determined the Georgia JV is a VIE, and that the Company is its primary beneficiary because the Company has an obligation to
absorb losses that are potentially significant and the Company controls the majority of the activities that impact the Georgia JV s
economic performance, specifically control of the INVOcell and lab services quality management. As a result, the Company consolidated
the Georgia JV s results with its own. As of December 31, 2023, the Company invested 
 million in the Georgia JV in the form of capital
contributions as well as 
 million in the form of a note. For the years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Georgia JV recorded net losses of 
 million and 
 million, respectively. Noncontrolling interest
in the Georgia JV was .

Each party owns one-third
of the Mexican incorporated company, Positib Fertility, S.A. de C.V. (the Mexico JV ). 

The

The
Company capitalizes the initial expense related to establishing patents by country and then amortizes the expense over the life of the
patent, typically 20 years. It then expenses annual filing fees to maintain the patents. The Company regularly reviews the value of its
patents in the marketplace in proportion to the expense it must spend to maintain the patent. The Company fully impaired its patents
as of December 31, 2022. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded amortization expenses related to patents of

Fertility Institute, that closed on August 10, 2023, the Company acquired tradename valued at ,
noncompetition agreements valued at 
 and goodwill of which includes assembled workforce
valued at .
The tradename was deemed to have a useful life of 
 years. The noncompetition agreements were deemed to have a useful life of

Agreement and WFRSA Asset Purchase Agreement, each of which provides that none of the sellers will engage in any business or services
that compete with the respective businesses for 5 years. 

Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortized. The Company reviewed

9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to be
effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 due solely to the events that led
to the restatements of our audited financial statements for the periods ending June 30, 2021 through June 30, 2024. As a result, management
determined a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed due to the accounting treatment of our right-of-use ROU asset and corresponding lease liability for our operating leases on our balance sheet. Management s review
was insufficient to identify an error in the incremental borrowing rate that led to our restatement of our financial statements, as described
in Notes 2 and 3 to the Notes to Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. In light of this material weakness, we performed
additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the Company. Our management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (1992 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the evaluation of
our internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective due to material weaknesses related to (1) a limited segregation of duties due to our lack of formal control
documentation, limited resources, and the small number of employees, and (2) a lack of adequate accounting resources to properly account
for complex accounting transactions. Management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses, which
could result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures that could result in a material misstatement to our interim
or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

4 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the SEC. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the control. 

The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
