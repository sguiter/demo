Total gross unrealized investment losses at September 30, 2024 decreased compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower interest rates in the third quarter 2024. Since the Company does not intend to sell and will more likely than not maintain each investment security until its maturity or anticipated recovery in value, and no significant credit risk is deemed to exist, these investments are not considered as credit-impaired. The Company believes its investment portfolio is diversified and expects no material loss to result from the failure to perform by issuers of the debt securities it holds.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

MANAGEMENT S OVERVIEW 
 
 Third quarter 2024 overview . We reported net income attributable to Stewart of 30.1 million 1.07 per diluted share) for the third quarter 2024, compared to net income of 14.0 million 0.51 per diluted share) for the third quarter 2023. Pretax income before noncontrolling interests for the third quarter 2024 was 42.8 million compared to pretax income before noncontrolling interests of 27.1 million for the prior year quarter. The third quarter 2024 results included 4.7 million of pretax net realized and unrealized gains, while the third quarter 2023 results included 1.9 million of pretax net realized and unrealized losses, both of which were primarily driven by net unrealized gains and losses, respectively, from fair value changes of equity security investments in the title segment. 
 
 Summary results of the title segment are as follows in millions, except pretax margin): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30 
 2024 2023 Change Operating revenues 553.3 522.1 6 Investment income 13.6 13.4 2 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) 
 4.8 (1.8) 361 Pretax income 
 45.0 35.4 27 Pretax margin 7.9 6.6 
 
 Title segment operating revenues improved 31.2 million, or 6 , in the third quarter 2024 primarily driven by increased revenues from our domestic commercial and agency title operations, while total segment operating expenses increased 28.4 million, or 6 , compared to the third quarter 2023. Agency retention expenses in the third quarter 2024 increased 15.0 million, or 7 , primarily resulting from 16.8 million, or 6 , improvement in gross agency revenues compared to the third quarter 2023. 
 
 Total title segment employee costs and other operating expenses increased by 14.6 million, or 6 , in the third quarter 2024 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher outside search and incentive compensation expenses related to higher commercial revenues. As a percentage of operating revenues, these expenses were 47.4 in both third quarters of 2024 and 2023. Title loss expense in the third quarter 2024 decreased 1.0 million, or 4 , primarily due to an overall favorable claim experience compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of title revenues, title loss expense was 3.8 for the third quarter 2024 compared to 4.3 in the third quarter 2023. 
 
 In cluded in the title segment s pretax income for the third quarters 2024 and 2023 were acquisition intangible asset amortization and related expenses of 2.8 million and 3.4 million, respectively. 
 
 Summary results of the real estate solutions segment are as follows in millions, except pretax margin): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30 
 2024 2023 Change Operating revenues 96.3 68.2 41 Pretax income 7.4 2.6 181 Pretax margin 7.7 3.8 
 
 17 

The segment's operating revenues increased 28.2 million, or 41 , in the third quarter 2024 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to improved revenues from our credit information and valuation services. On a combined basis, segment employee costs and other operating expenses in the third quarter 2024 increased 24.2 million, or 41 , in line with the higher operating revenues. Included in the segment's results for the third quarters 2024 and 2023 were acquisition intangible asset amortization expenses of 5.5 million and 6.3 million, respectively. 
 
 In regard to the corporate and other segment, pretax results were driven by net expenses attributable to corporate operations, which decreased to 9.5 million in the third quarter 2024, compared to 10.8 million in the third quarter 2023, primarily due to a prior acquisition-related settlement expense in the third quarter 2023. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures surrounding contingencies and commitments. 
 
 Actual results can differ from our accounting estimates. While we do not anticipate significant changes in our estimates, there is a risk that such changes could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations for future periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as previously disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Operations. Our primary business is title insurance and settlement-related services. We close transactions and issue title policies on homes, commercial and other real properties located in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and international markets through policy-issuing offices, agencies and centralized title services centers. Our real estate solutions operations include credit and real estate information services, valuation management services, online notarization and closing services, and search services. The corporate and other segment includes our parent holding company and centralized support services departments. 
 
 Factors affecting revenues. The principal factors that contribute to changes in our operating revenues include: 
 interest rates; 
 availability of mortgage loans; 
 number and average value of mortgage loan originations; 
 ability of potential purchasers to qualify for loans; 
 inventory of existing homes available for sale; 
 ratio of purchase transactions compared with refinance transactions; 
 ratio of closed orders to open orders; 
 home prices; 
 consumer confidence, including employment trends; 
 demand by buyers; 
 premium rates; 
 foreign currency exchange rates; 
 market share; 
 ability to attract and retain highly productive sales associates; 
 independent agency remittance rates; 
 opening and integration of new offices and acquisitions; 
 office closures; 
 number and value of commercial transactions, which typically yield higher premiums; 
 government or regulatory initiatives; 
 acquisitions or divestitures of businesses; 
 volume of distressed property transactions; and 
 seasonality and/or weather. 
 
 18 

Premiums are determined in part by the values of the transactions we handle. To the extent inflation or market conditions cause increases in the prices of homes and other real estate, premium revenues are also increased. Conversely, falling home prices cause premium revenues to decline. Home price changes may override the seasonal nature of the title insurance business. Historically, our first quarter is the least active in terms of title insurance revenues as home buying is generally depressed during winter months. Our second and third quarters are typically the most active as the summer is the traditional home buying season, and while commercial transaction closings are skewed to the end of the year, individually large commercial transactions can occur any time of the year. On average, title premium rates for refinance orders are lower compared to a similarly priced purchase transaction. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Comparisons of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 with the corresponding periods in the prior year are set forth below. Factors contributing to fluctuations in the results of operations are presented in the order of their monetary significance, and we have quantified, when necessary, significant changes. Segment results are included in the discussions and, when relevant, are discussed separately. 
 
 Our statements on home sales, interest rates and loan activity are based on published U.S. industry data from sources including Fannie Mae, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and the U.S. Census Bureau as of September 30, 2024. We also use information from our direct operations. 
 
 Operating environment. According to NAR, existing home sales (seasonally-adjusted basis) in September 2024 totaled 3.8 million units, which was 1 and 4 lower from August 2024 and a year ago, respectively, primarily due to the consumer hesitancy and affordability challenges, despite the gradually declining interest rate environment. The median home price increased 3 in September 2024 to 405,000 from September 2023, marking the 15th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases, which contributed to increases of 2 and 23 in unsold home inventory in September 2024 compared to August 2024 and September 2023, respectively. In relation to new residential construction, U.S. housing starts seasonally-adjusted) in September 2024 were 1 lower compared to both August 2024 and September 2023, while newly-issued building permits in September 2024 were 3 and 6 lower compared to August 2024 and September 2023, respectively. 
 
 Based on averaged estimates by Fannie Mae and MBA, total U.S. single family mortgage originations during the third quarter 2024 increased 10 to 464 billion compared to the prior year quarter, with purchase and refinancing originations increasing 4 and 42 , respectively. During the third quarter 2024, the average 30-year fixed interest rate averaged lower at 6.6 , compared to 7.0 in both the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, primarily influenced by the federal government's first interest rate reduction since March 2020. For the fourth quarter 2024, Fannie Mae and MBA expect the interest rate to further decline to an average of 6.2 , lower than the 7.3 average in the fourth quarter 2023, while total dollar originations for the fourth quarter 2024 are expected to increase 7 , compared to the third quarter 2024, behind a projected 69 increase in refinancing lending, partially offset by a 10 decline forecast in purchase originations. 
 
 Title revenues. Direct title revenue information is presented below:

 Rounded. 
 19 

Domestic non-commercial revenues in the third quarter 2024 were comparable to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the slightly higher average fee per file offsetting the slightly lower non-commercial domestic transactions in the third quarter 2024. Domestic non-commercial revenues in the first nine months of 2024 declined compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of lower residential transactions. Average residential fee per file for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 3,000, which was 2 higher compared to the third quarter 2023 and 6 lower compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a lower purchase transaction mix during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Domestic commercial revenues increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily as a result of increased average transaction size, primarily from the energy and multi-family sectors, and, for third quarter 2024, an improvement in commercial transactions closed compared to the third quarter 2023. Average domestic commercial fee per file increased to 17,700 (or 25 and 15,100 (or 34 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

 Other opened and closed orders, which typically have a lower average fee per file compared to residential purchase transactions, increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher home equity loan-related transactions. 
 
 Gross revenues from independent agency operations improved 16.8 million, or 6 , in the third quarter 2024 and 40.6 million, or 6 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased agent activity in 2024. Agency revenues, net of retention, increased 1.9 million, or 4 , in the third quarter 2024 and 3.0 million, or 2 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher gross agency revenues and slightly higher average agent retention rates. Refer further to the "Retention by agencies" discussion under Expenses below. 
 
 Real estate solutions revenues. Real estate solutions revenues improved 28.2 million, or 41 , in the third quarter 2024 and 69.4 million, or 34 , in the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by higher revenues from credit-related information and valuation services businesses compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Investment income. Investment income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 0.2 million, or 2 , and 8.7 million, or 27 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The higher investment income in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to higher interest income in 2024 resulting from earned interest from eligible escrow balances, which was an initiative that we started during the late second quarter 2023.

Expenses. An analysis of expenses is shown below:

 May not foot due to rounding. 
 
 Retention by agencies. Amounts retained by title agencies are based on agreements between agencies and our title underwriters. Amounts retained by independent agencies, as a percentage of revenues generated by them, averaged 82.8 and 83.0 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 82.4 in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, primarily as a result of increased revenues from states with relatively higher retention rates in 2024. The average retention percentage may vary from period to period due to the geographical mix of agency operations, the volume of title revenues and, in some states, laws or regulations. Due to the variety of such laws or regulations, as well as competitive factors, the average retention rate can differ significantly from state to state. In addition, a high proportion of our independent agencies are in states with retention rates greater than 80 . We continue to focus on increasing profit margins in every state, increasing premium revenue in states where remittance rates are higher, and maintaining the quality of our agency network, which we believe to be the industry s best, in order to mitigate claims risk and drive consistent future performance. While market share is important in our agency operations channel, it is not as important as margins, risk mitigation and profitability. 
 
 Employee costs. Consolidated employee costs increased 12.4 million, or 7 , and 11.3 million, or 2 , in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher salaries expense resulting from business growth and annual merit increases, higher incentive compensation consistent with improved revenues, and higher medical benefits expense due to increased claims activity. Title segment employee costs increased 10.4 million, or 6 , in the third quarter 2024 and 10.3 million, or 2 , in the first nine months of 2024, while employee costs in the real estate solutions segment increased 1.7 million, or 14 , in the third quarter 2024 and 2.6 million, or 7 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Total employee costs, as a percentage of total operating revenues, were 29.8 and 30.8 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 30.7 and 32.4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, primarily due to higher operating revenues. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 6,800 employees compared to approximately 7,000 and 6,800 employees as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other operating expenses . Other operating expenses include costs that are primarily fixed in nature, costs that follow, to varying degrees, changes in transaction volumes and revenues (variable costs) and costs that fluctuate independently of revenues (independent costs). Costs that are primarily fixed in nature include rent and other occupancy expenses, equipment rental, insurance, repairs and maintenance, technology costs, telecommunications and title plant expenses. Variable costs include appraiser and service expenses related to real estate solutions operations, outside search fees, attorney fee splits, credit losses (on receivables), copy supplies, delivery fees, postage, premium taxes and title plant maintenance expenses. Independent costs include general supplies, litigation defense, business promotion and marketing and travel. 
 
 21 

Consolidated other operating expenses increased 25.2 million, or 19 , in the third quarter 2024 and 64.4 million, or 17 , in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher information and service expenses and outside search fees consistent with increased revenues in our real estate solutions and commercial title operations, respectively. Total variable costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 27.9 million, or 40 , and 66.9 million, or 33 , primarily driven by our real estate solutions and commercial services operations. Total costs that are primarily fixed in nature decreased 1.3 million, or 3 , and 2.4 million, or 2 , in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, while independent costs decreased 1.5 million, or 10 , in the third quarter 2024 primarily due to office closure costs recorded in the third quarter 2023, and were comparable in both the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, primarily as a result of lower litigation-related expenses being offset by higher travel and business promotion expenses in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 As a percentage of total operating revenues, consolidated other operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 24.0 and 25.1 , respectively, compared to 22.1 and 23.1 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, primarily resulting from increased real estate solutions service expenses related to higher revenues in 2024. 
 
 Title losses. Provisions for title losses, as a percentage of title operating revenues, were 3.8 and 4.3 for the third quarters 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 4.0 and 4.1 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The title loss expense in the third quarter 2024 decreased 1.0 million, or 4 , compared to the prior year quarter, and was comparable in both the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, primarily due to our overall favorable claim experience, partially offset by effect of increased title revenues in 2024. The title loss ratio in any given quarter can be significantly influenced by changes in large claims incurred, escrow losses and adjustments to reserves for existing large claims. 
 
 The composition of title policy loss expense is as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Change Chg 2024 2023 Change Chg in millions) in millions) Provisions known claims: Current year 4.2 4.9 (0.7) (14) 9.8 10.6 (0.8) (8) Prior policy years 9.0 15.8 (6.8) (43) 51.4 58.3 (6.9) (12) 13.2 20.7 (7.5) (36) 61.2 68.9 (7.7) (11) Provisions IBNR Current year 18.0 17.4 0.6 3 50.2 48.4 1.8 4 Prior policy years (0.9) (0.9) (100) (0.2) 0.7 (0.9) (129) 17.1 17.4 (0.3) (2) 50.0 49.1 0.9 2 Transferred from IBNR to known claims (9.0) (15.8) 6.8 43 (51.4) (58.3) 6.9 (12) Total provisions 21.3 22.3 (1.0) (4) 59.8 59.7 0.1 
 
 Provisions for known claims arise primarily from prior policy years as claims are not typically reported until several years after policies are issued. Provisions - Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) are estimates of claims expected to be incurred over the next 20 years; therefore, it is not unusual or unexpected to experience changes to those estimated provisions in both current and prior policy years as additional loss experience on policy years is obtained. This loss experience may result in changes to our estimate of total ultimate losses expected (i.e., the IBNR policy loss reserve). Current year provisions - IBNR are recorded on policies issued in the current year as a percentage of premiums earned (provisioning rate). As claims become known, provisions are reclassified from IBNR to known claims. Adjustments relating to large losses (those individually in excess of 1.0 million) may impact provisions either for known claims or for IBNR. 
 
 22 

Total known claims provision decreased 7.5 million, or 36 , and 7.7 million or 11 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily as a result of timing of claims reported related to prior policy years. Current year IBNR provisions increased 0.6 million, or 3 , in the third quarter 2024 and increased 1.8 million, or 4 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased title premiums in 2024. As a percentage of title operating revenues, provisions - IBNR for the current policy year was 3.3 in both the third quarters 2024 and 2023, and were 3.3 and 3.4 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash claim payments in the third quarter 2024 decreased 2.4 million, or 11 , compared to the third quarter 2023, primarily due to lower payments on general claims and a loss recovery, partially offset by increased payments on large claims related to prior policy years. Cash claim payments in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 17.3 million, or 20 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower payments on both large and general claims related to prior policy years and several loss recoveries. We continue to manage and resolve large claims prudently and in keeping with our commitments to our policyholders. 
 
 In addition to title policy claims, we incur losses in our direct operations from escrow, closing and disbursement functions. These escrow losses typically relate to errors or other miscalculations of amounts to be paid at closing, including timing or amount of a mortgage payoff, payment of property or other taxes and payment of homeowners association fees. Escrow losses also arise in cases of fraud, and in those cases, the title insurer incurs the loss under its obligation to ensure that an unencumbered title is conveyed. Escrow losses are recognized as expenses when discovered or when contingencies associated with them (such as litigation) are resolved and are typically paid less than 12 months after the loss is recognized. 
 
 Total title policy loss reserve balances are as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in millions) Known claims 62.6 70.2 IBNR 455.0 458.1 Total estimated title losses 517.6 528.3 
 
 The actual timing of estimated title loss payments may vary since claims, by their nature, are complex and paid over long periods of time. Based on historical payment patterns, the outstanding loss reserves are substantially paid out within eight years. As a result, the estimate of the ultimate amount to be paid on any claim may be modified over that time period. Due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting future title policy losses, significant judgment is required by both our management and our third party actuaries in estimating reserves. As a consequence, our ultimate liability may be materially greater or less than current reserves and/or our third party actuary s calculated estimates. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 decreased 0.9 million, or 6 , and 0.8 million, or 2 , compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, primarily due to lower acquisition intangible amortization expenses resulting from several assets becoming fully amortized, partially offset by increased depreciation expenses related to new internal-use systems placed into operation. Acquisition intangible amortization expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 7.9 million and 24.0 million, respectively, compared to 9.3 million and 26.3 million in the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Income taxes. Ou r effective tax rates, based on income before taxes and after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling interests, were 23 and 26 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 39 and 31 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The higher effective tax rates in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 were primarily driven by discrete annual federal return tax adjustments recorded in the third quarter 2023 related to lower utilization of foreign tax credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our liquidity and capital resources reflect our ability to generate cash flow to meet our obligations to stockholders, customers (payments to satisfy claims on title policies), vendors, employees, lenders and others. As of September 30, 2024, our total cash and investments, including amounts reserved pursuant to statutory requirements aggregated 917.3 million. Of our total cash and investments at September 30, 2024, 491.2 million 241.7 million, net of statutory reserves) was held in the United States and the rest internationally (principally in Canada). 
 
 As a holding company, the parent company is funded principally by cash from its subsidiaries' earnings in the form of dividends, operating and other administrative expense reimbursements and pursuant to intercompany tax sharing agreements. Cash held at the parent company and its unregulated subsidiaries (which totaled 37.9 million at September 30, 2024) is available for funding the parent company's operating expenses, interest payments on debt and dividend payments to common stockholders. The parent company also receives distributions from Stewart Title Guaranty Company (Guaranty), its regulated title insurance underwriter, to meet cash requirements for acquisitions and other strategic investments. 
 
 A substantial majority of our consolidated cash and investments as of September 30, 2024 was held by Guaranty and its subsidiaries. The use and investment of these funds, dividends to the parent company, and cash transfers between Guaranty and its subsidiaries and the parent company are subject to certain legal and regulatory restrictions. In general, Guaranty uses its cash and investments in excess of its legally-mandated statutory premium reserve (established in accordance with requirements under Texas law) to fund its insurance operations, including claims payments. Guaranty may also, subject to certain limitations, provide funds to its subsidiaries (whose operations consist principally of field title offices and real estate solutions operations) for their operating and debt service needs. 
 
 We maintain investments in accordance with certain statutory requirements for the funding of statutory premium reserves. Statutory reserve funds are required to be fully funded and invested in high-quality securities and short-term investments. Statutory reserve funds are not available for current claim payments, which must be funded from current operating cash flow. Included in investments in debt and equity securities are statutory reserve funds of approximately 537.0 million and 527.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, included within cash and cash equivalents are statutory reserve funds of approximately 9.7 million and 10.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our known claims reserve totaled 62.6 million and our estimate of claims that may be reported in the future, under generally accepted accounting principles, totaled 455.0 million. In addition to this, we had cash and investments (at amortized cost and excluding equity method investments) of 282.5 million, which are available for underwriter operations, including claims payments, and acquisitions. 
 
 The ability of Guaranty to pay dividends to its parent is governed by Texas insurance law. The Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) must be notified of any dividend declared, and any dividend in excess of the greater of the statutory net operating income or 20 of surplus (which was approximately 168.7 million as of December 31, 2023) would be, by regulation, considered extraordinary and subject to pre-approval by the TDI. Also, the Texas Insurance Commissioner may raise an objection to a planned distribution during the notification period. Guaranty s actual ability or intent to pay dividends to its parent may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus and liquidity, which could affect its ratings and competitive position, the amount of insurance it can write and its ability to pay future dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Guaranty paid 30.0 million of dividends to the parent company. Guaranty did not pay any dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 24 

As the parent company conducts no operations apart from its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the discussion below focuses on consolidated cash flows. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 
 67.7 43.6 Net cash used by investing activities (71.6) (36.8) Net cash used by financing activities (45.7) (51.2) 
 
 Operating activities. Our principal sources of cash from operations are premiums on title policies and revenue from title service-related transactions, real estate solutions and other operations. Our independent agencies remit cash to us net of their contractual retention. Our principal cash expenditures for operations are employee costs, operating costs and title claims payments. 
 
 Net cash provided by operations in the first nine months of 2024 improved to 67.7 million compared to 43.6 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by improved net results and lower payments on claims in 2024. Although our business is labor intensive, we are focused on a cost-effective, scalable business model which includes utilization of technology, centralized back and middle office functions and business process outsourcing. We are continuing our emphasis on cost management, especially in light of the current economic environment due to elevated mortgage interest rates, specifically focusing on lowering unit costs of production and improving operating margins in our direct title and real estate solutions operations. Our plans to improve margins include additional automation of manual processes, further consolidation of our various systems and production operations, and full integration of acquisitions. We continue to invest in the technology necessary to accomplish these goals. 
 
 Investing activities. Net cash used by investing activities is primarily related to proceeds from matured and sold investments, purchases of investments, capital expenditures and acquisition of businesses. During the first nine months of 2024, total proceeds from securities investments sold and matured were 113.1 million compared to 111.6 million during the first nine months of 2023, while cash used for purchases of securities investments was 99.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 72.9 million in the same period of 2023. Additionally, cash paid for cost-basis and other investments was 29.8 million and 1.1 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 We used 28.1 million and 29.5 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment and other long-lived assets during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, while we used net cash of 14.4 million for an acquisition of a title office and a prior acquisition-related customer relationship asset in the title segment in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 25.1 million used for acquisitions in the title and real estate solutions segments during the first nine months of 2023. We maintain investment in capital expenditures at a level that enables us to implement technologies for increasing our operational and back-office efficiencies and to pursue growth in key markets. 
 
 Financing activities and capital resources. Total debt and stockholders equity were 445.7 million and 1.41 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, payments on notes payable of 3.4 million and 5.7 million, respectively, and notes payable additions of 3.4 million and 3.5 million, respectively, were related to short-term loan agreements in connection with our Section 1031 tax-deferred property exchange (Section 1031) business. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our line of credit facility was fully available, while our debt-to-equity and debt-to-capitalization ratios, excluding our Section 1031 notes, were approximately 32 and 24 , respectively. During the first nine months of 2024, we paid total dividends of 40.0 million 1.45 per common share), compared to total dividends paid in the first nine months of 2023 of 37.5 million 1.38 per common share). 
 
 25 

We believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet the cash needs of our ongoing operations, including consideration of the current economic and real estate environment created by the increasing mortgage interest rates. However, we may determine that additional debt or equity funding is warranted to provide liquidity for achievement of strategic goals or acquisitions or for unforeseen circumstances. Other than scheduled maturities of debt, operating lease payments and anticipated claims payments, we have no material contractual commitments. We expect that cash flows from operations and cash available from our underwriters, subject to regulatory restrictions, will be sufficient to fund our operations, including claims payments. However, to the extent that these funds are not sufficient, we may be required to borrow funds on terms less favorable than we currently have or seek funding from the equity market, which may not be successful or may be on terms that are dilutive to existing stockholders. 
 
 Contingent liabilities and commitments . See discussion of contingent liabilities and commitments in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities investments and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are reported net of deferred taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, until they are realized. During the first nine months of 2024, net unrealized investment gains of 11.8 million, net of taxes, which increased our other comprehensive income, were primarily related to net increases in the fair values of our foreign and corporate bond securities investments. These increases were primarily influenced by the federal government's reduction of interest rates during the third quarter 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, net unrealized investment losses of 6.3 million, net of taxes, which increased our other comprehensive loss, were primarily related to net decreases in the fair values of our foreign and corporate bond securities investments, primarily resulting from the elevated interest rate environment in 2023. 
 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily related to our Canadian and United Kingdom operations) decreased our other comprehensive income, net of taxes, by 0.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, while they increased our other comprehensive loss by 1.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements . We do not have any material source of liquidity or financing that involves off-balance sheet arrangements, other than our contractual obligations under operating leases. We also routinely hold funds in segregated escrow accounts pending the closing of real estate transactions and have qualified intermediaries in tax-deferred property exchanges for customers pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company holds the proceeds from these transactions until a qualifying exchange can occur. In accordance with industry practice, these segregated accounts are not included on the balance sheet. See Note 15 in our 2023 Form 10-K.
