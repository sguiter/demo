EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 Certara, Inc. (the Company is filing this Amendment No. 1 (this Amendment on Form 10-K/A to amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024 (the Original 10-K for the purpose of amending and restating Part II, Item 9A in its entirety to explicitly state management s conclusion that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023 pursuant to Item 308(a)(3) of Regulation S-K. In addition, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have provided new certifications dated as of the date of this Amendment. Except as expressly described herein, no other changes have been made to the Original 10-K. This Amendment speaks as of the date of the Original 10-K and does not reflect events that may have occurred after the date of the Original 10-K or modify or update any disclosures that may have been affected by subsequent events. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as is defined in the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting 

purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 RSM US LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in this Report, has also audited the effectiveness of Certara s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. The report of RSM US LLP is included under Item 8 of this Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
