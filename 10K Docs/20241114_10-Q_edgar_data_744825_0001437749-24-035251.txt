The terms of the contracts do not contain any guaranteed minimum payments. The Company s lease contracts typically have a ten -year term and are classified as either fee per use or revenue sharing. Fee per use revenues are recognized at the time the procedures are performed, based on each hospital s contracted rate and the number of procedures performed. Under revenue sharing arrangements, the Company receives a contracted percentage of the reimbursement received by the hospital. The amount the Company expects to receive is recorded as revenue and estimated based on historical experience. Revenue estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary. Some of the Company s revenue sharing arrangements also have a cost sharing component and net profit share for the operating costs of the center. The Company records an estimate of operating costs which are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the actual operating costs and profit. The operating costs and estimated net operating profit are recorded as other direct operating costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue related to these treatments is recognized on a gross basis at the time when the patient receives treatment. There is no variable consideration present in the Company s performance obligation and the transaction price is agreed upon per the stated contractual rate. GKPeru s payment terms are typically prepaid for self-pay patients and insurance provider payments are paid net 30 days. GKCE s patient population is primarily covered by a government payor and payments are paid between three and six months following issuance of an invoice. The facility in Puebla currently has a contract with local hospital to cover its eligible patient base and is also treating self-pay patients. Puebla s payment terms are typically prepaid for self-pay patients and net 30 days for the hospital patients. The Company did not capitalize any incremental costs related to the fulfillment of its customer contracts.

The RI Companies operate three, existing, stand-alone radiation therapy cancer centers in Woonsocket, Warwick and Providence, Rhode Island, where contracts exist between the Company s facilities and the individual patients treated at the facility. Under ASC 606, the Company acts as the principal in these transactions and provides, at a point in time, a single performance obligation, in the form of radiation therapy treatment. Revenue related to radiation therapy is recognized at the expected amount to be received, based on insurance contracts and payor mix, when the patient receives treatment. There is no variable consideration present in the Company s performance obligation and the transaction price is agreed upon per the stated contractual rate. Payment terms at these facilities are typically prepaid for self-pay patients and insurance providers are paid net to days. The Company did not capitalize any incremental costs related to the fulfillment of its customer contracts.

 Business Combinations - Business combinations are accounted for under ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all assets acquired, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed and applicable non-controlling interests are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Costs incurred associated with the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred. The allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to tangible assets, any intangible assets identified and non-controlling interests. These estimates include, but are not limited to, a market participant s expectation of future cash flows from acquired customers, acquired trade names, useful lives of acquired assets, and discount rates. See Note 11 - Rhode Island Acquisition to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion on acquisitions. 

Business segment information - Based on the guidance provided in accordance with ASC 280 Segment Reporting ASC 280 ), the Company analyzed its subsidiaries which are all in the business of providing radiosurgery and radiation therapy services, either through leasing to healthcare providers or directly to patients, and concluded there are two reportable segments, leasing and retail. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company provided Gamma Knife and PBRT equipment to eleven hospitals in the United States, which constitutes the leasing segment. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company owns and operates two single-unit Gamma Knife facilities in Lima, Peru and Guayaquil, Ecuador, one single-unit radiation therapy facility in Puebla, Mexico, and following the RI Acquisition on May 7, 2024, the Company also owns and operates three single-unit radiation therapy facilities in Rhode Island, which collectively constitute the retail segment. An operating segment is defined by ASC 280 as a component of an entity that engages in business activities in which it may recognize revenues and incur expenses, that has operating results that are regularly reviewed by the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ), and for which its discrete financial information is available. The Company determined two reportable segments existed due to similarities in economics of business operations and how the Company recognizes revenue for the patient treatment. The operating results of the reportable segments are reviewed by the Company s Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, who is also the CODM.

The Company determined its incremental borrowing rate to be in the range of approximately and by using available market rates and expected lease terms. The operating lease ROU assets and liabilities include any lease payments made and there were no lease incentives or initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company s lessee operating lease agreements are for administrative office space and related equipment and of its recently acquired stand-alone facilities in Rhode Island.

and extended the term of the Plan by five years to February 22, 2027. The Plan provides that the shares reserved under the Plan are available for issuance to officers of the Company, other key employees, non-employee directors, and advisors. further grants or share issuances will be made under the previous plans. 
 
 Stock-based compensation expense associated with the Company s stock options to employees is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company s stock awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. The estimated fair value of the Company s option grants is estimated using assumptions for expected life, volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate which are specific to each award. The estimated fair value of the Company s options is expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (requisite service period), usually the vesting period. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost before income tax effect for the Company s options and restricted stock awards in the amo unt of and for the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and and for the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, is reflected in selling and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 , there was approximately o f unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. This cost is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately three years.

(such transaction, the RI Acquisition ). The equity interests acquired by the Company under the IPA equates to a interest in each RI Company. The RI Companies operate three functional radiation therapy cancer centers in Rhode Island. The Company acquired the RI Companies to expand its growing retail business model in the United States and continue to diversify its cancer treatment product offerings. 
 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company, GenesisCare and GC Holdings entered into a First Amendment to the Investment Agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to extend the date on which a party could terminate the IPA if the closing conditions had not been met (the Permitted Termination Date from March 10, 2024 to April 30, 2024. On April 18, 2024, the parties agreed to a Second Amendment to the Investment Agreement pursuant to which GenesisCare agreed to sell a GE Discovery RT CT Simulator CT Sim to the Company for , payment for which was required 5 days following the close of the acquisition. On April 24 2024, the Company, GenesisCare and GC Holdings, entered into a Third Amendment to the Investment Agreement that further extended the Permitted Termination Date to May 31, 2024. On May 7, 2024, the parties entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Investment Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which GenesisCare agreed to transfer certain assets and payor contracts to the RI Companies, rather than transferring such assets and payor contracts to the Company. The parties completed the remaining closing conditions pursuant to the IPA and closed the RI Acquisition on May 7, 2024 the Closing Date ). 
 
 The RI acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires, among other things, that purchase consideration, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interest be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The allocation of purchase price considerations is preliminary, and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available. During the measurement period, which can be no more than one year from the Closing Date, the Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the final fair value of assets acquired. The assets acquired were recorded based on valuations derived from estimated fair value assessments and assumptions used by the Company. Thus, the provisional measurements of fair value discussed below are subject to change. The Company expects to finalize the valuations as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the Closing Date. While the Company believes its estimates and assumptions underlying the valuations are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different valuations assigned to the individual assets acquired, and the resulting amount of the bargain purchase gain. During the three -month period ended September 30, 2024 , the Company concluded some of the fair value estimates for accounts receivable, non-controlling interests, and unfavorable leasehold interests required adjustment. The adjusted preliminary allocations provided below reflect these changes. 
 
 The Company recorded medical equipment, facilities and non-controlling interest at fair value as of the Closing Date. Sales comparison and cost approaches were used to value the medical equipment, including assumptions of estimated direct costs associated with acquiring the equipment. Where appropriate, adjustments were made to the direct replacement cost to reflect depreciation and obsolescence. The sales comparison approach was also utilized to value certain assets, involving secondary market research. The cost approach was also used to value the facilities acquired and the unfavorable leasehold interest. The non-controlling interest was recorded at fair value based on the purchase price paid for the acquisition, after any premium or discount derived from the operating agreement with the minority owners. 

The Company recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price consideration as of the Closing Date, for the three -month period ended June 30, 2024. During the three -month period ended September 30, 2024 , the Company concluded some of the fair value estimates for accounts receivable, non-controlling interests, and unfavorable leasehold interests required adjustment. The net effect of these changes was an increase to the bargain purchase gain of , net of deferred taxes of 88,000. The net impact to the condensed consolidated statement of operations, outside of the change in the bargain purchase gain, was not material for the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The major classes of assets and liabilities to which the Company has preliminarily allocated the fair value of the purchase price consideration as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 

Accounts receivable 
 Medical equipment 
 Facilities 
 ROU assets 
 Unfavorable leasehold interests 
 Total assets acquired 
 
 Accounts payable 
 Lease liabilities 
 Deferred income taxes 
 Gain on bargain purchase

The Company recognized a bargain purchase, as defined by ASC 805, in connection with the RI Acquisition. The Company purchased the RI Companies as part of the sale of certain of GenesisCare s assets in its bankruptcy proceedings, resulting in a bargain purchase. A bargain purchase gain of and , net of deferred taxes of and , respectively is reflected in other income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 . None of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets because none were acquired as part of the transaction. The Company recorded the unfavorable lease position received as part of the RI Acquisition as a reduction to ROU assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The preliminary value of the acquired tangible assets acquired were as follows: 

Medical equipment 
 Total medical equipment and facilities acquired 

Costs related to legal, financial and due diligence services performed in connection with the RI Acquisition recorded in selling and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations were for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The net impact of the RI Acquisition on the consolidated results of operations, since the date of acquisition, are as follows: 

Operating income 

Per the guidance in ASC 805, the Company determined its consolidated financial results as if the RI Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2024. These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which the Company believes are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized had the Company and the RI Companies been combined during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of the Company s consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase accounting. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges are included in the earlier period presented. ASC 805 also requires presentation of proforma information for the comparable period, when the comparable period is presented. Due to the lack of reliable financial information for the RI Companies following the protracted bankruptcy proceedings, the Company was not able to obtain financial information sufficient to make these disclosures. Therefore, the Company has not made the comparable period proforma disclosure because it would be impracticable to do. 
 
 Following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of the Company on an unaudited, pro forma basis, as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2024. The supplemental proforma disclosure excludes the non-recurring impact from the bargain purchase gain generated from the RI Acquisition.

 Overview 
 
 American Shared Hospital Services is a leading provider of turn-key technology solutions for stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced radiation therapy equipment and services. The main drivers of the Company s revenue are numbers of sites, procedure volume, and reimbursement. The Company delivers radiation therapy through medical equipment leasing and direct patient services, its two reportable segments. The medical equipment leasing segment, which we also refer to as the Company s leasing segment, operates by fee-per-use contracts or revenue sharing contracts where the Company shares in the revenue and operating costs of the equipment. The Company leases ten Gamma Knife systems and one PBRT system as of September 30, 2024, where a contract exists between the hospital and the Company. On May 7, 2024, the Company acquired 60 of the equity interests of the RI Companies, which operate three single-unit radiation therapy facilities in Rhode Island. The Company, through GKF, owns and operates two single-unit Gamma Knife facilities in Lima, Peru and Guayaquil, Ecuador. The Company also owns and operates a single-unit radiation therapy center in Puebla, Mexico, which began treating patients in July 2024. The Company s facilities in Rhode Island, Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico are considered direct patient services, which we also refer to as the Company s retail segment, where a contract exists between the Company s facilities and the individual treated at the facility. 
 
 Based on the guidance provided in accordance with ASC 280, the Company determined it has two reportable segments, leasing and retail. See Note 1 - Basis of Presentation to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. The Company s Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflects activity for both segments and specifically addresses a segment when appropriate to the discussion. 
 
 Reimbursement 
 
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid CMS has established a 2024 delivery code reimbursement rate of approximately 7,420 7,691 in 2023) for a Medicare Gamma Knife treatment. The approximate CMS reimbursement rates for delivery of PBRT for a simple treatment without compensation for 2024 is 561 572 in 2023) and 1,362 1,323 in 2023) for simple with compensation, intermediate and complex treatments, respectively. 
 
 On September 29, 2020, CMS published a final rule that would have implemented a new mandatory payment model for radiation oncology services delivered to certain Medicare beneficiaries: the Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Method RO APM ). On August 29, 2022, CMS published a final rule that delayed the start date of the RO APM to a date to be determined through future rulemaking and amended the definition of model performance period to provide that the start and end dates of the five-year model performance period will be established by CMS through future rulemaking. If the RO APM had not been delayed, it would have significantly altered CMS payment methodology from a fee for service paradigm to a set reimbursement by cancer type methodology for radiation services provided within a 90 day episode of care. Under the RO APM, hospital based and free-standing radiation therapy providers would have been required to participate in the model based on whether the radiation therapy provider is located within a randomly selected core-based statistical area. At this time, it is not clear if the RO APM will be implemented and, if it is implemented, the timing for implementation and in what form it will be implemented. If a start date for the RO APM is proposed, CMS will provide at least six months notice in advance of the proposed start date, and the proposed start date will be subject to public comment.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the condensed consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 
 
 The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These policies along with the disclosures presented in the other condensed consolidated financial statement notes and, in this discussion, and analysis, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the condensed consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts, and the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified revenue recognition and costs of sales for turn-key and revenue sharing arrangements, accounting for business combinations, and the carrying value of property and equipment and useful lives, and as such the aforementioned could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. The following are our critical accounting policies in which management s estimates, assumptions and judgments most directly and materially affect the condensed consolidated financial statements: 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company recognizes revenues under ASC 842 and ASC 606. The Company had ten domestic Gamma Knife units, two international Gamma Knife units, three domestic LINAC units, and one PBRT system in operation in the United States as of September 30, 2024 and twelve domestic Gamma Knife units, two international Gamma Knife units, and one PBRT system in operation in the United States as of September 30, 2023. Five of the Company s ten domestic Gamma Knife customers are under fee-per-use contracts, and five customers are under revenue sharing arrangements. The ten domestic Gamma Knife contracts operate under the Company s leasing segment. The Company s PBRT system at Orlando Health is considered a revenue share contract operating under the leasing segment. The Company s three single-unit facilities, acquired in Rhode Island in May 2024, operate under the Company s retail segment. The Company, through GKF, also owns and operates two single-unit, international Gamma Knife facilities in Lima, Peru and Guayaquil, Ecuador. These two units economically operate under the Company s retail segment. 
 
 Rental revenue from medical equipment leasing leasing The Company recognizes revenues under ASC 842 when services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured, on either a fee per use or revenue sharing basis. The terms of the contracts do not contain any guaranteed minimum payments. The Company s lease contracts typically have a ten-year term and are classified as either fee per use or revenue sharing. Fee per use revenues are recognized at the time the procedures are performed, based on each hospital s contracted rate and the number of procedures performed. Under revenue sharing arrangements, the Company receives a contracted percentage of the reimbursement received by the hospital. The amount the Company expects to receive is recorded as revenue and estimated based on historical experience. Revenue estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary. Some of the Company s revenue sharing arrangements also have a cost sharing component and net profit share for the operating costs of the center. The Company records an estimate of operating costs which are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the actual operating costs and profit. The operating costs and estimated net operating profit are recorded as other direct operating costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized leasing revenue of approximately 3,312,000 and 11,464,000 compared to 3,946,000 and 12,987,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. Of the ASC 842 revenue, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, approximately 2,316,000 and 7,386,000 were for PBRT services compared to 2,219,000 and 7,078,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. 
 
 Direct patient services income retail The Company has stand-alone facilities in Lima, Peru, Guayaquil, Ecuador, and Puebla, Mexico where contracts exist between the Company s facilities and the individual patients treated at the facility. Under ASC 606, the Company acts as the principal in these transactions and provides, at a point in time, a single performance obligation, in the form of a Gamma Knife or radiation therapy treatment. Revenue related to these treatments is recognized on a gross basis at the time when the patient receives treatment. There is no variable consideration present in the Company s performance obligation and the transaction price is agreed upon per the stated contractual rate. GKPeru s payment terms are typically prepaid for self-pay patients and insurance provider payments are paid net 30 days. GKCE s patient population is primarily covered by a government payor and payments are paid between three and six months following issuance of an invoice. The facility in Puebla currently has a contract with one local hospital to cover its eligible patient base and is also treating self-pay patients. Puebla s payment terms are typically prepaid for self-pay patients and net 30 days for the hospital patients. The Company did not capitalize any incremental costs related to the fulfillment of its customer contracts.

On May 7, 2024, the Company acquired 60 of the interests of the RI Companies. The RI Companies operate three, existing, stand-alone radiation therapy cancer centers in Woonsocket, Warwick and Providence, Rhode Island, where contracts exist between the Company s facilities and the individual patients treated at the facility. Under ASC 606, the Company acts as the principal in these transactions and provides, at a point in time, a single performance obligation, in the form of radiation therapy treatment. Revenue related to radiation therapy is recognized at the expected amount to be received, based on insurance contracts and payor mix, when the patient receives treatment. There is no variable consideration present in the Company s performance obligation and the transaction price is agreed upon per the stated contractual rate. Payment terms at these facilities are typically prepaid for self-pay patients and insurance providers are paid net 30 to 60 days. The Company did not capitalize any incremental costs related to the fulfillment of its customer contracts. The Company also concluded the three radiation therapy facilities are part of its retail segment, see further discussion at Note 1 - Basis of Presentation to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Accounts receivable balances under ASC 606 at September 30, 2024 and January 1, 2024 were 5,357,000 and 1,626,000, respectively. Accounts receivable balances under ASC 606 at September 30, 2023 and January 1, 2023 were 1,416,000 and 1,118,000 , respectively. For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized retail revenues of approximately 3,687,000 and 7,807,000 compared to 988,000 and 2,440,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. 
 
 Salvage Value on Equipment 
 
 Salvage value is based on the estimated fair value of the equipment at the end of its useful life. The Company determines salvage value based on the estimated fair value of the equipment at the end of its useful life. There is no active resale market of Gamma Knife, LINAC or PBRT equipment, but the Company believes its salvage value estimates were a reasonable assessment of the economic value of the equipment when the contract ends. There is no salvage value assigned to the two international Gamma Knife units as of September 30, 2024. The Company also has not assigned salvage value to its PBRT or LINAC equipment as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 Business combinations are accounted for under ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all assets acquired, identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed and applicable non-controlling interests are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Costs incurred associated with the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred. The allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to tangible assets, any intangible assets identified and non-controlling interests. These estimates include, but are not limited to, a market participant s expectation of future cash flows from acquired customers, acquired trade names, useful lives of acquired assets, and discount rates. See Note 11 - Rhode Island Acquisition to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion on acquisitions.

Third Quarter 2024 Results 
 
 Revenues increased by 1,865,000 and 3,644,000 to 6,999,000 and 19,271,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5,134,000 and 15,627,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. Revenues from the Company s leasing segment decreased by 634,000 and 1,523,000 to 3,312,000 and 11,464,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,946,000 and 12,987,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease in leasing revenue was driven by lower Gamma Knife volumes. Revenues from the Company s retail segment increased by 2,699,000 and 5,367,000 to 3,687,000 and 7,807,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 988,000 and 2,440,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increase in retail revenue was primarily due to revenue generated by the RI Companies following the closing of the RI Acquisition on May 7, 2024. 
 
 Revenues generated from the Company s PBRT system increased by 97,000 and 308,000 to 2,316,000 and 7,386,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,219,000 and 7,078,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increase for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was driven by higher volumes. The increase for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in average reimbursement due to a shift in payor mix from Medicare to commercial or other payors, which are reimbursed at a higher rate. 
 
 The number of PBRT fractions increased by 64 and decreased by 330 to 1,252 and 3,764 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,188 and 4,094 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease in PBRT volumes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was partially due to severe weather in Florida near the hospital where PBRT is provided, impacting patient scheduling. 
 
 Gamma Knife revenue decreased by 895,000 and 1,218,000 to 1,821,000 and 7,131,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,716,000 and 8,349,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease in Gamma Knife revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was due to a decrease in procedure volume from both the retail and leasing segments . 
 
 The number of Gamma Knife procedures decreased by 98 and 87 to 218 and 831 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 316 and 918 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease in Gamma Knife procedures for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the leasing segment. The decrease in Gamma Knife procedures for the nine-month period was also due to the leasing segment and due to two customer contracts that expired during the second and third quarters of 2023. The decrease in Gamma Knife procedure volume for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was offset by increases in procedure volume from the Company s retail segment . 
 
 Gamma Knife procedures for the Company s leasing segment decreased by 82 and 166 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease in Gamma Knife procedures for the Company s leasing segment for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was driven by downtime for an equipment upgrade at one customer location, one contract expiration that occurred in the third quarter of 2023 and staffing shortages at two of the customer locations. The decrease in Gamma Knife for the Company s leasing segment procedures for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to two customer contracts that expired during the second and third quarters of 2023. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was also impacted by downtime for equipment upgrades at two customer locations and staffing shortages at two of the customer locations. Gamma Knife procedures for the Company s retail segment decreased by 16 and increased by 79 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to improved marketing and physician outreach at the Company s international locations. The Company also performed a Cobalt-60 reload and upgrade of the equipment at it s site in Ecuador in the fourth quarter of 2023. The replacement of the Cobalt-60 provides for faster treatment times. 
 
 The Company acquired the RI Companies on May 7, 2024 and included the financial results from their operations from May 7, 2024, the Closing Date of the transaction, through September 30, 2024. The Company s stand-alone radiation therapy facility in Puebla, Mexico also began treating patients in July 2024. Radiation therapy revenues generated from the three stand-alone facilities acquired through the RI Acquisition and the radiation therapy facility in Puebla were 2,862,000 and 4,754,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. Radiation therapy procedures for the three stand-alone facilities acquired through the RI Acquisition and the radiation therapy facility in Puebla were 5,186 and 7,785 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total costs of revenue increased by 2,597,000 and 4,191,000 to 5,629,000 and 13,290,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,032,000 and 9,099,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. 
 
 Maintenance and supplies and other direct operating costs, related party, increased by 74,000 and decreased by 109,000 to 783,000 and 2,181,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 709,000 and 2,290,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increase in maintenance and supplies and other direct operating costs, related party, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was driven by maintenance contracts for the equipment in Rhode Island. The decrease in maintenance and supplies and other direct operating costs, related party, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was due to the expiration of two service contracts that completed in the second and third quarters of 2023, with the related customer contracts. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company has upgraded four of its existing Gamma Knife units to the Esprit. The new Esprit units are under warranty for the first year of service, also driving lower maintenance expense. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 438,000 and 606,000 to 1,666,000 and 4,418,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,228,000 and 3,812,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was due higher depreciation for upgraded equipment at four of the Company s Gamma Knife locations, depreciation incurred for the equipment acquired in the RI Acquisition, and the Company s new facility in Puebla, Mexico. These increases were offset by depreciation from the Company s contract that expired in the third quarter of 2023. The equipment related to the second customer contract that expired, was fully depreciated prior to 2023. 
 
 Other direct operating costs increased by 2,085,000 and 3,694,000 to 3,180,000 and 6,691,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,095,000 and 2,997,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increase in other direct operating costs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was due to operating costs from the Company s recently acquired facilities in Rhode Island and the Company s new facility in Puebla, Mexico, which are part of the Company s retail segment and have higher operating costs compared to facilities in the Company s leasing segment. 
 
 Selling and administrative expense increased by 188,000 and 436,000 to 1,923,000 and 5,698,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,735,000 and 5,262,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The increase for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher personnel related costs and legal fees, partially attributable to the Company s pursuit of new business opportunities, including the RI Acquisition. The increase in selling and administrative expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher personnel related and other expense, partially attributable to the Company s pursuit of new business opportunities, including the RI Acquisition, offset by lower rent expense.

Interest expense increased by 59,000 and 245,000 to 336,000 and 1,070,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 277,000 and 825,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The debt under the Credit Agreement carries a floating interest rate of SOFR plus 3 . The increase for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in SOFR and borrowings, including the Supplemental Term Loan received in January 2024, compared to the same periods of the prior year. 
 
 The Company recorded a 3,942,000 net bargain purchase gain related to the RI Acquisition that closed on May 7, 2024. The Company acquired 60 of the equity interests of the RI Companies, which operate three radiation therapy facilities, for 2,850,000. The assets acquired exceeded the total purchase price by the bargain purchase amount and the Company recorded this difference as a gain for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company made adjustments to the initial provisional accounting for the RI Acquisition. The net impact of the adjustments resulted in an increase to the net bargain purchase gain of 263,000. 
 
 Interest and other income, net, decreased by 88,000 and 106,000 to 47,000 and 212,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 135,000 and 318,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was due to decreases in the interest received on the Company s cash, due to lower average cash balances, compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased by 229,000 and 337,000 to an income tax benefit of 169,000 and 244,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 60,000 and 93,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to losses incurred by the Company s leasing segment, driven by lower Gamma Knife volume. 
 
 Net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests decreased by 250,000 and increased by 16,000 to a loss of 203,000 and 91,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to income of 47,000 and a loss of 107,000 for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. Net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests represents net income or loss earned by the 40 non-controlling interest in the Rhode Island facilities, the 19 non-controlling interest in GKF, and net income or loss of the non-controlling interests in various subsidiaries controlled by GKF. The decrease or increase in net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests reflects the relative profitability of the three Rhode Island facilities and GKF. 
 
 Net (loss) income attributable to American Shared Hospital Services decreased by 325,000 and increased by 3,319,000 to a loss of 207,000, or 0.03 per diluted share and income of 3,514,000 or 0.54 per diluted share for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 118,000, or 0.02 per diluted share and net income of 195,000 or 0.03 per diluted share for the same periods in the prior year, respectively. The Company incurred a net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to losses incurred by the leasing segment, driven by lower Gamma Knife volume, partially offset by net income from the retail segment. Net income increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 due to the bargain purchase gain generated from the RI Acquisition and net income earned from the Rhode Island facilities acquired, partially offset by increased total costs of revenue. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company s primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures as well as support working capital requirements. In general, the Company s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and the 7,000,000 Revolving Line. As of September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 4,500,000 on its Revolving Line. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 14,077,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to 13,808,000 at December 31, 2023. The Company s cash position increased by 269,000 during the first nine months of 2024 due to net advances on the Revolving Line of 2,000,000, net cash received from the RI Acquisition of 538,000, long-term debt financing of 2,700,000, and capital contributions of 38,000. These increases were offset by cash used by operating activities of 107,000, payment for the purchase of property and equipment of 3,278,000, payments on long-term debt of 1,430,000, debt issuance costs of 97,000 and distributions to non-controlling interests of 95,000. The Company s expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for capital expenditures, business expansion, working capital, and other general corporate purposes. The Company has scheduled interest and principal payments under its debt obligations of approximately 4,529,000 during the next 12 months . 
 
 Working Capital 
 
 The Company had working capital at September 30, 2024 of 8,159,000 compared to 9,677,000 at December 31, 2023. The 1,518,000 decrease in working capital was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, other and related party accrued liabilities, advances on the Revolving Line, and an increase in current portion of long-term debt offset by increases in accounts receivable. The Company believes that its cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and other cash resources are adequate to meet its scheduled debt obligations and working capital requirements during the next 12 months. See additional discussion in the Commitments section below. The Company, in the past, has secured financing for its Gamma Knife and radiation therapy units. The Company has secured financing for its projects from several lenders and anticipates that it will be able to secure financing on future projects from these or other lending sources, but there can be no assurance that financing will continue to be available on acceptable terms.

Long-Term Debt 
 
 On April 9, 2021, the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries entered into a five year 22,000,000 credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, N.A., which refinanced its existing domestic Gamma Knife portfolio. The lease financing previously obtained by Orlando was also refinanced as long-term debt by the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes three loan facilities: (1) a 9,500,000 term loan (the Term Loan ), which was used to refinance the domestic Gamma Knife debt and finance leases and the associated closing costs; (2) a 5,500,000 delayed draw term loan (the DDTL ), which was used to refinance the Company s PBRT finance leases and associated closing costs and to provide additional working capital for the Company; and (3) a 7,000,000 revolving line of credit (the Revolving Line ), which is available for the Company s future projects and general corporate purposes. The Company borrowed 4,500,000 under the Revolving Line as of September 30, 2024. The Credit Agreement is 48 amortized over a 58-month period with a balloon payment upon maturity and is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. The Revolving Loan, the Term Loan, and the DDTL will mature on April 9, 2026 unless accelerated due to the occurrence of certain events specified in the Credit Agreement. The Revolving Line is charged an unused line fee of 0.25 per annum. The Term Loan and DDTL have interest and principal payments due quarterly. Principal amortization on an annual basis for the Term Loan and DDTL equates to 48 of the original principal loan commitments in years one through five and an end of term payment of the remaining principal balance. 
 
 On January 25, 2024, the, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement with Fifth Third which amended the Credit Agreement to add the Supplemental Term Loan, a new term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 2,700,000. The proceeds of the Supplemental Term Loan were advanced in a single borrowing on January 25, 2024, and were used to finance capital expenditures that the Company paid cash for during 2023 for its operations in Puebla, Mexico and other related transaction costs. The Supplemental Term Loan will mature on January 25, 2030 (the Maturity Date ), unless accelerated due to the occurrence of certain events specified in the Credit Agreement. Interest on the Supplemental Term Loan is payable monthly during the initial twelve month period following the First Amendment Effective Date. Following such twelve month period, the Company is required to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest to fully amortize the amount outstanding under the Supplemental Term Loan by the Maturity Date. The Supplemental Term Loan is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. The First Amendment also replaces the LIBOR-based rates in the Credit Agreement with SOFR-based rates. Pursuant to the First Amendment, advances under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to SOFR plus 3.00 , subject to a SOFR floor of 0.00 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was subject to customary covenants under the Credit Agreement which included, among other covenants and obligations, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.0 and a total funded debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 (tested on a trailing twelve-month basis at the end of each fiscal quarter), along with an annual clean-up covenant that requires the Company to cause the outstanding principal balance under the Revolving Loan to be less than 3,500,000 for at least 30 consecutive days during each calendar year (the Credit Agreement Covenants ). The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement Covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company s acquisition of GKCE and the Gamma Knife Esprit in Ecuador is financed with DFC. The loan entered into with DFC in June 2020 was obtained through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, HoldCo, and is guaranteed by GKF. The DFC Loan is secured by a lien on GKCE s assets. The first tranche of the DFC Loan was funded in June 2020. In October 2023, the second tranche of the DFC Loan was funded in the amount of 1,750,000 to finance its equipment upgrade in Ecuador. The amount outstanding under the first tranche of the DFC Loan is payable in 29 quarterly installments with a fixed interest rate of 3.67 . The amount outstanding under the second tranche of the DFC Loan is payable in 16 quarterly installments with a fixed interest rate of 7.49 . 
 
 The DFC Loan contains customary covenants including without limitation, requirements that HoldCo maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity and cash flow as well as depository requirements. On March 28, 2024, HoldCo received a waiver and amendment from DFC for certain covenants as of December 31, 2023 and through December 31, 2024 and amended other covenants and definitions permanently. HoldCo was in compliance with all debt covenants pursuant to the DFC Loan as amended and waived at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company s combined long-term debt, net of deferred issuance costs, totaled 14,375,000 as of September 30, 2024. See Note 3 - Long Term Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

19

Commitments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had commitments to purchase and install four Leksell Gamma Knife Esprit Systems Esprit ), one Gamma Plan workstation, and two Linear Accelerator LINAC systems. One LINAC and one Esprit will be placed at future customer sites. The remaining Esprit upgrades and LINACs are scheduled to occur during 2025 or later at existing customer sites. Total Gamma Knife and LINAC commitments as of September 30, 2024 were 13,383,000. There are no deposits on the condensed consolidated balance sheets related to these commitments as of September 30, 2024 . It is the Company s intent to finance substantially all of these commitments. There can be no assurance that financing will be available for the Company s current or future projects, or at terms that are acceptable to the Company. However, the Company currently has cash on hand of 14,077,000 and its Revolving Line of 7,000,000 and is actively engaged with financing resources to fund these projects. The Company borrowed 4,500,000 on the Revolving Line as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On September 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Maintenance and Support Agreement with Mevion, which provides for maintenance and support of the Company s PBRT unit at Orlando Health from September 2022 through April 2026. The agreement requires the Company to make an annual prepayment of 1,939,000 for the current contractual period (one year). As of September 30, 2024, half of this prepayment was recorded as a prepaid contract and is being amortized over the one-year service period. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had commitments to service and maintain its Gamma Knife, LINAC and PBRT equipment. The service commitments are carried out via contracts with Mevion, Elekta and Mobius Imaging, LLC. The Company s commitment to purchase one LINAC system also includes a 5-year agreement to service the equipment, respectively. Total service commitments as of September 30, 2024 were 13,712,000. The Gamma Knife and certain other service contracts are paid monthly, as service is performed. The Company believes that cash flow from cash on hand and operations will be sufficient to cover these payments. 

Related Party Transactions 
 
 The Company s Gamma Knife business is operated through its 81 indirect interest in its GKF subsidiary. The remaining 19 of GKF is owned by a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Elekta, which is the manufacturer of the Gamma Knife. Since the Company purchases its Gamma Knife units from Elekta, there are significant related party transactions with Elekta, such as equipment purchases, commitments to purchase and service equipment, and costs to maintain the equipment.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries is communicated to the principal executive officer and our principal financial officer. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Company completed an acquisition on May 7, 2024. Many of the financial cycles are consistent with the Company s current reporting cycles and, therefore, the related existing controls. The Company implemented new controls related to the revenue cycle for the RI Companies and will continue to assess the need for additional controls and resources through the year as it relates to the acquired operations. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
