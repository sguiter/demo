 million and an accumulated deficit of million, and the Company expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund current operations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements. The Company expects to seek additional funding through equity financing, government or private-party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the Company s stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital, the Company will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or future commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all. 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

 Since the Company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share, as the inclusion of all potential ordinary share equivalents outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2024, potential ordinary shares issuable for stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (September 30, 2023: ).

 In June 2024, the Company announced plans to prioritize its pipeline to focus on the development of VTP-300 for chronic Hepatitis B virus infection and VTP-1000 in celiac disease. Given this change in Company focus, management identified circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's intangible assets may not be recoverable. Therefore, the Company performed both a qualitative and quantitative assessment in July 2024 and determined that the carrying amount of the Company's intangible assets are recoverable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not identify any additional circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of the Company's intangible assets are not recoverable.

However, it is possible for our Articles, or shareholders at a general meeting representing at least of our ordinary shares present (in person or by proxy) and eligible to vote at that general meeting, to disapply these preemptive rights by passing a special resolution.

 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this unaudited Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings with the SEC. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapeutic candidates designed to guide T cells to overcome chronic infectious diseases and autoimmunity. Helping patients and their families is the guiding principle at the heart of Barinthus Bio. We stand apart through our focused pipeline, built around proprietary platform technologies; viral vector-based, consisting of ChAdOx and MVA; and synthetic, consisting of SNAP-Tolerance Immunotherapy, or SNAP-TI. These platforms are enabling us to develop antigen-specific immunotherapeutic candidates designed to optimize the disease fighting capabilities of T cells and restore a healthy balance. Our immunotherapeutic candidates are designed to work by increasing disease-specific CD8+ T cell activity in the case of chronic infectious diseases, or by dampening effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increasing regulatory T cells in autoimmunity. 
 Following our strategic pipeline update in June 2024, we are prioritizing a pipeline of two key product candidates in infectious disease and autoimmunity that harness our proprietary viral vector and synthetic platform technologies. These include: VTP-300, a Phase 2 immunotherapeutic candidate designed as a potential component of a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B virus infection utilizing ChAdOx/MVA; and VTP-1000, our first clinical autoimmune candidate designed to utilize the SNAP-TI platform to treat patients with celiac disease, and marking our entry into the autoimmunity space. 
 We are evaluating VTP-850, a second-generation immunotherapeutic candidate designed to treat recurrent prostate cancer through to the end of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. 
 Alongside these proprietary programs, we have partnerships in place to advance three additional prophylactic and therapeutic product candidates including VTP-500 for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, VTP-400 for Zoster and VTP-600 for multiple cancer indications including Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, or NSCLC, and Squamous Esophageal Cancer, or ESCC. We also co-invented Vaxzevria, a COVID-19 vaccine with the University of Oxford, which was exclusively licensed worldwide to AstraZeneca. 
 We believe our proven scientific expertise, focused portfolio and experience on product candidate development uniquely positions us to navigate towards delivering treatments for patients with chronic infectious diseases and autoimmune-disorders that have a significant impact on their everyday lives. 
 On August 9, 2022, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended, or the Shelf, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to the registration and potential future issuance of ordinary shares, including ordinary shares represented by American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, debt securities, warrants and/or units of any combination thereof in the aggregate amount of up to 200.0 million. The Shelf was declared effective on August 17, 2022. We also simultaneously entered into a sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent, providing for the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to an aggregate of 75.0 million of our ordinary shares represented by ADSs from time to time in at-the-market offerings under the Shelf. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 1,875,848 ordinary shares represented by ADSs under the sales agreement, amounting to net proceeds of 4.3 million. 
 We incurred net losses each year since inception through to December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated net income of 5.3 million, primarily as a result of revenues arising from prior AstraZeneca sales of Vaxzevria and our agreement with Oxford University Innovation (OUI). For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated a net loss of 73.4 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 8.1 million and 40.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 217.1 million and we do not currently expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. We expect to incur net

 operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for approval, and in some cases proceed to commercialization of our product candidates, as well as continue our research and development efforts and invest to establish a commercial manufacturing facility, as and when appropriate. 
 At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate, or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of all of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our product candidates that we develop through our programs. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of product candidates we develop, if at all. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates to approval and commercialization, including the uncertainty of: 
 successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
 sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
 acceptance of investigational new drug applications, or INDs, for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials; 
 successful and timely enrollment and completion of clinical trials; 
 data from our clinical program supporting approvable and commercially acceptable risk/benefit profiles for our product candidates in the intended populations; 
 receipt and maintenance of necessary regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, in the light of the commercial environment then existent; 
 availability and successful procurement of raw materials required to manufacture our products for clinical trials, scale-up of our manufacturing processes and formulation of our product candidates for later stages of development and commercial production; 
 establishing either our own manufacturing capabilities or satisfactory agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for later stages of development and commercial manufacturing; 
 entry into collaborations where appropriate to further the development of our product candidates; 
 obtaining and maintaining intellectual property and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates as well as qualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending such intellectual property rights and claims; 
 successfully launching or assisting with the launch of commercial sales of our product candidates following approval; 
 acceptance of each product s benefits and uses by patients, the medical community and third-party payors following approval; 
 the prevalence and severity of any adverse events experienced with our product candidates in development; 
 establishing and maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval; 
 obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors if necessary or desirable; and 
 effectively competing with other therapies. 
 
 A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our current and future product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate, in either direction. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future owing to research outcomes or other opportunities, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such altered operating plans. Unless and until we can generate a substantial amount of revenue from our product candidates, if approved, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt

 financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources, or any combination of the foregoing. Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and other financial resources, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2026. These estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources more quickly than we expect. 
 
 If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we would be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 These are estimated timelines only and our pipeline may be subject to change. 
 VTP-300 (Chronic hepatitis B) 
 In September 2024, enrollment was completed in the HBV003 trial (NCT05343481) of VTP-300 in 121 adult participants with chronic hepatitis B. The Phase 2b trial is designed to obtain critical dosing information for a potential functional cure regimen for chronic hepatitis B, with participants receiving VTP-300 and low-dose (LD) nivolumab. 
 A further data update on both the ongoing HBV003 Phase 2b and IM-PROVE Phase 2a trials in collaboration with Arbutus Biopharma is expected at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting 2024 scheduled from November 15-19, 2024 in San Diego, CA., with a late-breaking oral presentation and late-breaking poster having been accepted on the trials, respectively. 
 VTP-1000 (Celiac Disease) 
 In September 2024, we initiated the first-in-human Phase 1 trial of VTP-1000 in adults with celiac disease. The AVALON trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which includes a controlled gluten challenge. It will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VTP-1000. 
 VTP-850 (Prostate Cancer) 
 In October 2024, we announced that the PCA001 trial (NCT05617040) of VTP-850 in men with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer (i.e. , biochemical recurrence) had completed enrollment of 22 participants. The Phase 1 trial is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy, as measured by PSA and T cell response. We expect to have data from this Phase 1 trial in the first half of 2025.

 Management Team 
 Effective from September 1, 2024, Graham Griffiths, our Chief Business Officer since October 2017, was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. 
 Financial Update 
 In October 2024, we were informed of additional amounts due to the Company from Oxford University Innovation (OUI) in relation to the Company's share of royalties received by OUI as a result of prior commercial sales of Vaxzevria by AstraZeneca. As a result, 15.0 million revenue has been recognized in the third quarter of 2024. There is no expectation of additional payments or that we will be notified of such payments in a timely manner. We expect that this additional revenue will enable us to fund our research and development plans further into the second quarter of 2026. 
 
 Impact of Israel and Gaza Conflict, Ukraine Crisis and Iran Conflict 
 In respect of the international conflict in Israel and Gaza, situation in Ukraine and Iran conflict, we have no operations or suppliers based in Israel or Gaza, or in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia or Iran, and as a result, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe the impact on our business, operations and financial condition will be minimal. 
 
 Impact of Global Economic Conditions and Inflationary Pressures 
 Instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These inflationary pressures and volatile interest rates in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere have given rise to increasing concerns that the U.S., U.K. and other economies are now in, or may enter, economic recession. Sustained inflationary pressures, volatile interest rates, an economic recession or continued or intensified disruptions in the global financial markets could adversely affect our future financing capability or ability to access the capital markets. Additionally, we may incur future increases in operating costs due to additional inflationary increases. 
 
 Components of Our Operating Results 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from direct product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future, if at all. Most of our revenue to date has been derived from the OUI License Agreement Amendment with OUI relating to Vaxzevria. 
 In April 2020, we entered into the OUI License Agreement Amendment with OUI in respect of our rights to use the ChAdOx1 technology in COVID-19 vaccines to facilitate the license of those rights by OUI to AstraZeneca. Under this agreement, we are entitled to receive from OUI a share of payments, including royalties and milestones, received by OUI from AstraZeneca in respect of this vaccine. In March 2022, we were notified by OUI of the commencement of revenue relating to prior commercial sales of Vaxzevria. Our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.0 million (three and nine months ended September 30, 2023: nil and 0.8 million, respectively), representing the amounts we have been notified of as due by OUI to date and an estimate of future receipts, constrained to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue would not occur. In May 2024, AstraZeneca announced its planned withdrawal of Vaxzevria as demand had declined, and therefore we do not expect to receive any future revenue relating to future commercial sales of Vaxzevria. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses since inception have consisted of research and development costs and general and administrative costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Since our inception, we have focused significant resources on our research and development activities, including establishing and building on our adenovirus platform, further enhancing our in-licensed ChAdOx1, ChAdOx2 and MVA vectors, developing a new next-generation adenoviral vector, acquiring new technology platforms including SNAP, conducting preclinical studies, developing various manufacturing processes, initiating the clinical trials for VTP-200, 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 VTP-300, VTP-600, VTP-850 and VTP-1000 and readying VTP-500 for clinical trials. Research and development activities account for a large portion of our operating expenses, and we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include: 
 salaries, benefits, and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; 
 expenses incurred in connection with the development of our programs including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors, academic institutions and contract research organizations, or CROs; 
 the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in preclinical development and clinical trials, including agreements with third parties, such as contract manufacturing organizations, consultants and contractors; 
 laboratory costs; and 
 leased facility costs, equipment depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation, in our executive, finance, business development and other administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include consulting fees and professional service fees for auditing, tax and legal services, rent expenses related to our offices, depreciation, foreign exchange gains and losses on our cash balances, other central non-research costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. When determining the fair value of contingent consideration, significant judgment is used to determine the probability of success of achievement of the technology and clinical milestones and the date of the expected milestone. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities in both the United Kingdom and United States and potentially prepare for manufacturing and/or commercialization of our current and future product candidates. These costs will increase if our headcount rises to allow full support for our operations as a public company, including increased expenses related to legal, accounting, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission, directors and officers liability insurance premiums and investor relations activities. 
 Other Operating Income 
 Other operating income includes the CEPI Funding Agreement, pursuant to which CEPI will provide funding to us to advance the development of VTP-500, our vaccine candidate against MERS. When there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions attached to a received grant, and when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, grant income is recognized as other operating income on a gross basis in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income on a systematic basis over the periods in which we recognize expenses for the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Payments received in advance of incurring reimbursable expenses are recorded as deferred income. Any remaining unused amounts of the cash payments received on the balance sheets will be disclosed as restricted cash in the notes of the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Income/(Expense) 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income results primarily from the interest earned on our short-term cash deposits and cash balances held by Barinthus Biotherapeutics (UK) Limited. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense results primarily from the asset retirement obligation discounted over the length of the relevant lease.

 Research and Development Incentives 
 Research and development incentives contain payments receivable from the United Kingdom government related to corporation tax relief on research and development projects in the United Kingdom. We account for such relief received as other income. 
 We benefit from the United Kingdom research and development tax credit regime, being the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises R D tax relief program, or SME Program, and, to the extent that our projects are grant funded or relate to work subcontracted to us by third parties, the Research and Development Expenditure Credit program, or RDEC Program. 
 Until March 2023 under the SME program, we were able to surrender some of our trading losses that arise from qualifying research and development activities for a cash rebate of up to 33.4 of such qualifying research and development expenditure. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise employment costs for research staff, consumables, outsourced contract research organization costs and utilities costs incurred as part of research projects. Certain subcontracted qualifying research and development expenditures were eligible for a cash rebate of up to 21.7 . A large portion of costs relating to research and development, clinical trials and manufacturing activities are eligible for inclusion within these tax credit cash rebate claims. 
 From April 2023, under the SME Program, the enhanced rate of deduction has decreased from 230 to 186 , the SME credit rate has been reduced from 14.5 to 10 (except for R D intensive SMEs, which will benefit from a credit rate of 14.5 ), and our SME cash rebate has been reduced from an effective rate of 33.4 to 18.6 (or 27.0 for R D intensive SMEs) and from 21.7 to 12.1 for subcontractors. We are regularly assessing if we can claim under the loss-making R D Intensive Scheme for SMEs, which would provide benefits consistent with those claimed under the previous SME Program. From the analysis performed, we do not currently expect to claim under the loss-making R D Intensive Scheme for SMEs primarily due to the proportion of total relevant expenditure occurring outside the United Kingdom. 
 We may not be able to continue to claim research and development tax credits under the SME program in the future because we may no longer qualify as a small or medium-sized company. In addition, the EU State Aid cap limits the total aid claimable in respect of a given project to 7.5 million which may impact our ability to claim R D tax credits in future. Further, the U.K. Finance Act of 2021 introduced a cap on payable credit claims under the SME Program in excess of 20,000 with effect from April 2021 by reference to, broadly, three times the total Pay As You Earn, or PAYE, and National Insurance Contributions, or NICs, liability, subject to an exception which prevents the cap from applying. That exception requires us to create, take steps to create or manage intellectual property, as well as having qualifying research and development expenditure in respect of connected parties, which does not exceed 15 of the total claimed. If such an exception does not apply, this could restrict the amount of payable credit that we claim. 
 The merged scheme Research Development expenditure credit (RDEC) and enhanced R D intensive support (ERIS) replace the old RDEC and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) schemes for accounting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2024. For expenditure under the merged scheme, the rate of Research and Development expenditure credit will be 20 , which is the same as the rate under the old RDEC scheme for expenditure incurred on or after April 1, 2023. For loss-makers and small profit-makers, a lower rate of notional tax restriction (currently 19 applies at payment. For all other companies, the restriction will continue to apply at the Corporation Tax main rate (currently 25 ). The amount of the PAYE cap for claims under both the merged scheme and ERIS is 20,000 plus 300 of the company s relevant PAYE and National Insurance contributions liabilities. The PAYE cap (where applicable) will limit the amount of payable credit that can be received in the accounting period under consideration. Any excess over the cap will be carried forward and treated as an amount of Research and Development expenditure credit to which the company will be entitled for the next accounting period. Based on prior claims and the split of qualifying spend it is expected that the PAYE cap is unlikely to affect the net benefit and the EU State Aid cap will not impact the benefit under the merged scheme. Furthermore, for accounting periods starting on or after April 1, 2024, legislation included in Finance Act 2024 restricts the extent to which payments to contractors for R D, and externally provided workers can qualify for R D relief where R D activity takes place outside the UK. This may restrict the ability to include cost incurred on EPWs based in the US and Switzerland for future accounting periods. 
 Unsurrendered UK losses may be carried forward indefinitely to be offset against future taxable profits, subject to numerous utilization criteria and restrictions. The amount that can be offset each year is limited to 5.0 million plus an incremental 50 of UK taxable profits.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, income and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to fair value of contingent consideration and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 We believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. 
 
 Goodwill 
 We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We have elected to assess goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis of determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We have one reporting unit. Accordingly, our review of goodwill impairment indicators is performed at the entity-wide level. This requires us to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors, including clinical data results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, economic projections and other market data. Because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors, significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact our future financial results. The goodwill of 12.2 million recognized as of September 30, 2024 relates to the acquisition of Avidea on December 10, 2021. The Company has identified qualitative indicators of impairment due to a sustained decline in the price of the Company s ADSs, whereby the market capitalization continues to be below the value of the net assets of the Company, and the plans announced in June 2024 to prioritize its pipeline to focus on the development of VTP-300 for chronic Hepatitis B virus infection and VTP-1000 in celiac disease. Therefore, the Company performed both an interim qualitative and quantitative assessment in July 2024 to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company also performed an interim qualitative assessment as of September 30, 2024 and did not identify any additional circumstances that may indicate it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Based on these assessments, management determined it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and hence no impairment loss has been recognized related to goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Long-lived assets 
 The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used, including property and equipment, intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Evaluation of recoverability is first based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. In June 2024, the Company announced plans to prioritize its pipeline to focus on the development of VTP-300 for chronic Hepatitis B virus infection and VTP-1000 in celiac disease. Given this change in Company focus, management identified circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amount of the Company's intangible assets may not be recoverable. Therefore, the Company performed both a qualitative and quantitative assessment in July 2024 and determined that the carrying amount of the Company's intangible assets are recoverable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not identify any additional circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of the Company's intangible assets are not recoverable, hence no impairment loss related to intangible assets has been recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Contingent consideration 
 We recognize a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of Avidea. Avidea s stockholders may be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to 40.0 million in additional payments, payable in a combination of cash and ADSs, upon the achievement of certain milestones. This contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date, and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. The fair value of the contingent consideration is a Level 3 valuation determined using significant unobservable inputs, being the probability of pursuit of the activity associated with the milestone, the probability of success of the achievement of the milestone, the expected date of milestone achievement and applying the relevant discount rate. Changes in fair value are recognized in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

 Revenue 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our revenue consisted of 15.0 million and nil, respectively, from the OUI License Agreement Amendment with respect to payments due from OUI in connection with prior commercial sales of Vaxzevria. There is no guarantee that such payments will be made in the future and, if they do, that we will be notified of such payments in a timely manner.

 1 The development of VTP-500 is funded pursuant to an agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). 
 2 The VTP-600 NSCLC/ESCC Phase 1/2a trial is sponsored by Cancer Research UK. 
 3 Research and development expenses related to VTP-1100 HPV Cancer were presented together with VTP-1000 Celiac in the prior period comparative, because our SNAP product candidates were both preclinical. Expenses related to VTP-1100 HPV Cancer are now included in "Other and earlier stage programs," because we are deferring the planned IND application for VTP-1100 in HPV cancer and we are preparing to initiate the clinical trial for VTP-1000 Celiac. 
 4 This includes 0.6 million of personnel-related indirect expenses relating to time spent progressing the VTP-500 MERS program funded by CEPI. 
 
 Our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 11.1 million and 15.1 million, respectively. 
 Direct expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.5 million and 11.6 million, respectively, and consisted of outside services, consultants, laboratory materials, clinical trials, manufacturing of clinical trial materials, as well as costs for external preclinical services and sample testing. Of the 5.1 million decrease, 2.1 million pertains to a decrease in VTP-300 HBV clinical trial and manufacturing costs as enrollment for the two ongoing Phase 2 trials is now complete, 0.8 million pertains to the completion of the VTP-1000 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2024, and 1.0 million pertains to a reduction in clinical trial and manufacturing development costs for the VTP-200 HPV program following the completion of the Phase 1b/2 APOLLO (HPV001) clinical trial in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Indirect research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.6 million and 3.5 million, respectively. The increase of 1.1 million primarily relates to personnel expenses, including share-based payment charges of 0.4 million, due to an increase in personnel time spent on research and development activities. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 13.4 million and 1.0 million, respectively. The increase of 12.4 million relates primarily to a net increase of 14.3 million in net loss on foreign exchange, offset by a decrease in personnel expenses, including share-based payment charges of 1.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs following the reduction in workforce in Q2 2024 and less personnel time spent on general and administrative activities.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other operating income was 0.2 million and nil, respectively, resulting from the funding provided by CEPI under the Funding Agreement, dated December 20, 2023, entered into by and among us, the Chancellors, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford and the CEPI for the development of VTP-500 through Phase 2 clinical trials for the prevention of MERS. 
 Interest Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income was 0.6 million and 0.2 million, respectively, resulting from the interest earned on our short-term cash deposits held by Barinthus Biotherapeutics (UK) Limited. 
 Research and Development Incentives 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 research and development incentives were 0.6 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Such research and development incentives relate to corporation tax relief on research and development projects incentive programs in the United Kingdom. The decrease of 0.6 million is due to reduced expenses eligible for the research and development corporation tax relief, as well as a decrease in the enhanced rate of deduction and credit rate under the scheme, effective from April 2023. 
 Tax benefit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the tax benefit was 0.003 million and 0.6 million respectively, which primarily relates to movements in deferred tax.

 prior commercial sales of Vaxzevria. There is no guarantee that such payments will be made in the future and, if they do, that we will be notified of such payments in a timely manner. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Change Direct research and development expenses by program: VTP-200 HPV 1,882 4,463 (2,581) VTP-300 HBV 7,695 10,752 (3,057) VTP-500 MERS 1

 1 The development of VTP-500 is funded pursuant to an agreement with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). 
 2 The VTP-600 NSCLC/ESCC Phase 1/2a trial is sponsored by Cancer Research UK. 
 3 Research and development expenses related to VTP-1100 HPV Cancer were presented together with VTP-1000 Celiac in the prior period comparative, because our SNAP product candidates were both preclinical. Expenses related to VTP-1100 HPV Cancer are now included in "Other and earlier stage programs," because we are deferring the planned IND application for VTP-1100 in HPV cancer and we are preparing to initiate the clinical trial for VTP-1000 Celiac. 
 4 This includes 0.6 million of personnel-related indirect expenses relating to time spent progressing the VTP-500 MERS program funded by CEPI. 
 
 Our research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 33.9 million and 38.5 million, respectively. 
 Direct expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 18.8 million and 27.1 million, respectively, and consisted of outside services, consultants, laboratory materials, clinical trials, manufacturing of clinical trial materials, as well as costs for external preclinical services and sample testing. Of the 8.3 million decrease, 3.1 million pertains to a decrease in VTP-300 HBV clinical trial and manufacturing costs as enrollment for the two ongoing Phase 2 trials is now complete, 2.6 million pertains to the completion of the VTP-1000 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2024, and the deprioritization of VTP-1100 for HPV cancer announced earlier in 2024, and 2.6 million pertains to a reduction in clinical trial and manufacturing development costs for the VTP-200 HPV program following the completion of the Phase 1b/2 APOLLO (HPV001) clinical trial in 2024. 
 Indirect research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.1 million and 11.4 million, respectively. Of the 3.7 million increase, 3.3 million relates primarily to an average increase in headcount on a year-to-date basis, severance costs of 0.7 million across our locations in the United Kingdom and United States following the Company s announcement in June 2024 to prioritize its pipeline, more personnel time spent on research and development activities a nd higher share-based payment charges due to higher value awards expensed in the period.

 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 26.6 million and 26.2 million, respectively. The increase of 0.4 million relates primarily to an increase in net loss on foreign exchange of 5.5 million, offset by a decrease in personnel expenses primarily due to a decrease in personnel cost due to the workforce reduction in Q2 2024 (net of 0.1 million severance cost) and a reduction in share-based payment charges due to the timing of high value awards, a decrease in insurance costs of 1.5 million related to a reduction in insurance premiums, and a decrease of 0.7 million in facility related costs due to the relocation to our new U.S. laboratory in June 2023. 
 Other Operating Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other operating income was 1.0 million and nil, respectively, resulting from the funding provided by CEPI under the Funding Agreement, dated December 20, 2023, entered into by and among us, the Chancellors, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford and the CEPI for the development of VTP-500 through Phase 2 clinical trials for the prevention of MERS. 
 Interest Income 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest income was 2.0 million and 2.3 million, respectively, resulting from the interest earned on our short-term cash deposits held by Barinthus Biotherapeutics (UK) Limited. 
 Research and Development Incentives 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 research and development incentives were 1.9 million and 2.9 million, respectively. Such research and development incentives relate to corporation tax relief on research and development projects incentive programs in the United Kingdom. The decrease of 1.0 million is due to reduced expenses eligible for the research and development corporation tax relief, as well as a decrease in the enhanced rate of deduction and credit rate under the scheme, effective from April 2023. 
 Tax benefit 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the tax benefit was 0.05 million and 2.3 million respectively, which primarily relates to movements in deferred tax. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through private and public placements of our ordinary and preferred shares as well as from grants and research incentives, various agreements with public funding agencies, the issuance of convertible loan notes, and most recently from upfront, royalty and milestone payments from OUI in connection with the OUI License Agreement Amendment. Through September 30, 2024, we received gross proceeds of approximately 329.2 million from the issuance of our ordinary and preferred shares and convertible loan notes. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 106.1 million. Recent financing and corporate milestones include the following: 
 Between July 2020 and November 2020, we raised gross proceeds of 41.2 million from the issuance of convertible loan notes; 
 In March 2021, we raised gross proceeds of 125.2 million from the issuance of our series B shares; 
 In May 2021, we raised gross proceeds of 110.5 million from the initial public offering of our ordinary shares on NASDAQ; 
 Between April 2022 and June 2023, we received 44.5 million of cash from OUI for the commercial sales of Vaxzevria; 
 Between December 2022 and September 2024, we raised net proceeds of 4.3 million from the issuance of shares represented by ADSs through at-the-market offerings under the sales agreement with Jefferies LLC.

Table of Contents 

 On August 9, 2022, we filed the Shelf, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to the registration and potential future issuance of ordinary shares, including ordinary shares represented by ADSs, debt securities, warrants and/or units of any combination thereof in the aggregate amount of up to 200.0 million. The Shelf was declared effective on August 17, 2022. We also simultaneously entered into a sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent, providing for the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to an aggregate of 75.0 million of our ordinary shares represented by ADSs from time to time in at-the-market offerings under the Shelf. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 1,875,848 ordinary shares represented by ADSs under the sales agreement amounting to net proceeds of 4.3 million. 
 We do not currently expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future, if at all. In most periods, we have incurred operating losses as a result of ongoing efforts to develop our immunotherapy platforms and our product candidates, including conducting ongoing research and development, preclinical studies, clinical trials, providing general and administrative support for these operations and developing our intellectual property portfolio. We expect to continue to incur net negative cash flows from operations for at least the next few years as we progress clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to manufacture and commercialization of our most advanced product candidates. Operating profits may arise earlier if programs are licensed or sold to third parties before final approval, but this cannot be guaranteed. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth a summary of the primary sources and uses of cash (in thousands) for each period presented: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (42,026) (31,322) Net cash used in investing activities (614) (5,566) Net cash provided by financing activities 1,326 1,763 Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 5,326 1,049 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (35,988) (34,076) 
 Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 42.0 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of 40.6 million adjusted by unrealized foreign exchange loss of 2.0 million, depreciation and amortization of 4.4 million, share based compensation of 4.0 million, non-cash lease expenses of 1.1 million, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of 12.6 million primarily related to a 15.0 million increase in contract asset (including related parties), a 2.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses, a 2.0 million increase in deferred income, a 1.3 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a 0.2 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 31.3 million, primarily resulting from our net loss of 56.2 million adjusted by share based compensation of 4.3 million, depreciation and amortization of 4.0 million, non-cash lease expense of 0.8 million, foreign exchange loss of 0.9 million, deferred tax benefit of 2.3 million, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of 17.1 million related to a 5.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, a 5.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a 5.2 million increase in accrued expenses. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 cash used in investing activities was 0.6 million and 5.6 million, respectively. These amounts are resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to leasehold improvements on our new office and laboratory facilities in Germantown, Maryland, United States, that we relocated to in June 2023. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 1.3 million and 1.8 million, respectively. These amounts primarily related to net proceeds received from the issuance of ordinary shares through the at-the-market sales agreement.

 Effect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effect of foreign exchange on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was a gain of 5.3 million and a gain of 1.0 million respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations between the United States dollar and pound sterling exchange rates. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials of our product candidates. As a result, we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 2016, through to December 31, 2021. We were profitable in 2022, however we have negative operating cash flows for the period ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 217.1 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: 
 pursue the clinical and preclinical development of our current product candidates; 
 use our technologies to advance additional product candidates into preclinical and clinical development; 
 seek marketing authorizations for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; 
 attract, hire and retain additional clinical, regulatory, quality control and other scientific personnel; 
 establish our manufacturing capabilities through third parties or by ourselves and scale-up manufacturing to provide adequate supply for clinical trials and commercialization, including any manufacturing finishing and logistics personnel; 
 expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel appropriately, including personnel to support our manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; 
 maintain, expand, enforce, and protect our intellectual property portfolio as appropriate; 
 establish sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution teams and infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own or jointly; 
 acquire or in-license other companies, product candidates and technologies; and 
 incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating our business, including office expansion and the additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditure to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend on the rate of future growth of our expenses combined with our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital unless and until eliminated by revenue growth. 
 We may require substantial additional financing in the future to meet any such unanticipated factors and a failure to obtain this necessary capital could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations. 
 Since our foundation, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities for our viral vector platform (ChAdOx and MVA), acquisition of additional complementary platforms such as SNAP-TI, development of new technologies in house, and our product candidates derived from these technologies. Preclinical studies and especially clinical trials and additional research and development activities will require substantial funds to complete. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the development of our current product candidates and programs as well as any future product candidates we may elect to pursue, as well as the gradual gaining of control over our required manufacturing capabilities and other corporate functions. These expenditures will include costs associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and potentially in-house manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and 
 28

 selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise as outlined above. Because the outcome of any preclinical study or clinical trial is uncertain and the rate of change of third-party costs is also unpredictable, we cannot reasonably estimate now the actual amounts which will be necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates successfully. 
 
 Our future capital requirements may depend on many factors, including: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our current and future product candidates and programs, and of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
 the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue, and of other indications for our current product candidates that we may pursue; 
 the stability, scale and yield of future manufacturing processes as we scale-up production and formulation of our product candidates either internally or externally for later stages of development and commercialization; 
 the timing of success achieved and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals and developing our ability to establish license or sale transactions and/or sales and marketing capabilities, if any, for our current and future product candidates if clinical trials and approval processes are successful; 
 the success of our collaborations with CEPI, Oxford University, Arbutus, CanSino, CRUK and the Ludwig Institute and any future collaboration partners; 
 our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; 
 the cost to the company of commercialization activities for our current and future product candidates that we may take on, whether alone or with a collaborator; 
 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; 
 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties or other income from, our future products, if any; and 
 the emergence and success or otherwise of competing infectious disease or autoimmune therapies and other market developments. 
 A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our current and future product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate, in either direction. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future owing to research outcomes or other opportunities, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such altered operating plans. Unless and until we can generate a substantial amount of revenue from our product candidates, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources, or any combination of the foregoing. 
 Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and other financial resources, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2026. These estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources more quickly than we expect. 
 If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we would be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Lease, Purchase, and Other Obligations 
 We have operating lease obligations related to our property, plant and equipment. The obligations related to both short- and long-term lease arrangements are set forth in Note 15 Commitment and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs and other third parties for clinical trials and preclinical research studies and testing. These contracts are generally cancellable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancellable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. 
 We have contingent payment obligations that we may incur upon achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, as applicable, or royalty payments that we may be required to make under our licenses; however, the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our ADSs held by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. 
 Foreign Currency and Currency Translation 
 We are subject to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically with respect to the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Australian dollar. Our reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the functional currency of Barinthus Biotherapeutics plc and its consolidated subsidiaries, Barinthus Biotherapeutics (UK) Limited and Vaccitech Oncology Limited, is the pound sterling. The functional currency of our wholly owned foreign subsidiary, Barinthus Biotherapeutics North America, Inc. is the United States dollar. The functional currency of our wholly owned foreign subsidiary, Barinthus Biotherapeutics Australia Pty, is the Australian dollar. The functional currency of our wholly owned foreign subsidiary, Barinthus Biotherapeutics S.R.L, is the euro. The functional currency of our wholly owned foreign subsidiary, Barinthus Biotherapeutics Switzerland GmbH, is the Swiss franc. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of cash balances held by Barinthus Biotherapeutics (UK) Limited in United States dollars. 
 Assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. Translation adjustments are included in the condensed consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Adjustments that arise from exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in operating expenses, net in the condensed consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as incurred. 
 We incur significant operating costs in the U.K. and face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the United States dollar and the pound sterling arising from expenses and payables at our U.K. operations that are settled in pound sterling. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an average 10 weakening in the United States dollar relative to the pound sterling would have resulted in a material change to our current and projected expenses denominated in pound sterling.

 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 We are not currently exposed significantly to market risk related to changes in interest rates, as we have no significant interest-bearing liabilities. We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 106.1 million as of September 30, 2024, which were primarily held as account balances with banks in the United Kingdom, United States and Australia. A hypothetical 10 relative change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Based on our evaluation, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings . 
 From time to time, we may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of September 30, 2024, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024.
