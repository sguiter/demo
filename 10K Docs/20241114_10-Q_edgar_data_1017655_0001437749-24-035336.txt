and net working capital of and reported cash flows used from operations of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has reported a net income of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and has an accumulated deficit of at September 30, 2024. 

Management believes that the Company has adequate cash resources to fund operations during the next 12 months after the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. In addition, management continues to explore opportunities and has organized additional resources to grow the Paid platform. However, there can be no assurance that anticipated growth in new business will occur, and that the Company will be successful in launching new products and services. Management may seek alternative sources of capital to support the growth of future operations. 

Although there can be no assurances, the Company believes that the above management plans will be sufficient to meet the Company s working capital requirements through the end of November 2025 and will have a positive impact on the Company for the foreseeable future. 

of its revenues from Canada and from the U.S. during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

At September 30, 2024, the Company maintained of its property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, in Canada. 

Nature of Goods and Services 

For label generation service revenues, the Company recognizes revenue when a customer has successfully prepared a shipping label and their shipment is delivered. Customers with pickups and shipments in transit after the end of the reporting period are recorded as contract liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The service is offered to consumers via an online registration and allows users to create a shipping label using a credit card on their account (all customers must have a valid credit card on file to process shipments on the ShipTime platform). 

For brewery management software revenues, the Company recognizes subscription revenue on a monthly basis. Brewery management software subscribers are billed monthly at the first of the month. All payments are made via credit card for the following month. 

Merchant processing revenue consists of fees a seller pays us to process their payment transactions and is recognized upon authorization of a transaction. Revenue is recognized net of estimated refunds, which are reversals of transactions initiated by sellers. We act as the merchant of record for our sellers, which puts us in their shoes with respect to card networks and puts the risk for refunds and chargebacks on us. The gross transaction fees collected from sellers is recognized as revenue as we are the primary obligor to the seller and are responsible for processing the payment, have latitude in establishing pricing with respect to the sellers and other terms of service, have sole discretion in selecting the third party to perform the settlement, and assume the credit risk for the transaction processed. 

Revenue Disaggregation 

The Company operates in four reportable segments (see below). 

Performance Obligations 

At contract inception, an assessment of the goods and services promised in the contracts with customers is performed and a performance obligation is identified for each distinct promise to transfer to the customer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services). The Company fulfills nearly all of its performance obligations within a one-to-two-week period and contracts with customers have an original expected duration of less than one month. The Company generally has an unconditional right to consideration when the services are initiated or soon thereafter. The amount due from the customer is either collected up front or recorded as accounts receivable. The amounts related to services that are not yet completed at the reporting date are presented as contract liabilities. The Company measures the performance of its obligations as services are completed over the life of a shipment, including services at origin, freight and destination. This method of measurement of progress depicts the pattern of the Company's actual performance under the contracts with the customer. 

For arrangements under which the Company provides a subscription for brewery management software, the Company satisfies its performance obligations over the life of the subscription, typically twelve months or less. 

Merchant processing customers receive a merchant identification number which allows them to process credit card transactions. Once the transaction is approved, the funds are distributed in an overnight feed and the Company has met its performance obligation. 

The Company has no shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers. 

Revenues are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to government authorities. 

Significant Payment Terms 

Pursuant to the Company s contracts with its customers, amounts are collected up front primarily through credit/debit card transactions. The Company has offered its customers consolidated payments which are billed weekly and are paid with a credit card on file. Accordingly, the Company determined that its contracts with customers do not include extended payment terms or a significant financing component. 

Measurement of Credit Losses 

The Company has accounts receivable and note receivable and monitors the granting of credit and collecting debt on an ongoing basis. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, and an evaluation of potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. The Company has two notes receivable and is a senior secure lender with an absolute obligation for one of the notes. The primary note was evaluated for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 by considering the contractual obligation, the valuation of the assets and the senior position of the repayment. 

Variable Consideration 

In some cases, the nature of the Company s contracts may give rise to variable consideration, including rebates and cancellations or other similar items that generally decrease the transaction price. 

Variable consideration is estimated at the most likely amount that is expected to be earned. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. 

Revenues are recorded net of variable consideration, such as rebates, refunds, and cancellations. 

Warranties 

The Company s products and services are provided on an as is basis and no warranties are included in the contracts with customers. Also, the Company does not offer separately priced extended warranty or product maintenance contracts. 

Contract Assets 

Typically, the Company has already collected revenue from the customer at the time it has satisfied its performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company has only a small balance of accounts receivable, totaling and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has no customers that made up 10 of the accounts receivable balance at September 30, 2024 and one customer that made up 10 of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2023. Generally, the Company does not have material amounts of contract assets since revenue is recognized as control of goods is transferred or as services are performed. 

Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) 

Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received in advance of the Company s performance. Contract liabilities were and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenues of related to contract liabilities outstanding at the beginning of the period.

Significant Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in our Form 10-K filed on April 1, 2024, as updated and amended in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. However, certain of our accounting policies, most notably with respect to revenue recognition, are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Those estimates and judgments are based upon our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

As a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to provide the information for this Item 3. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as its principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive/financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company has identified numerous material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time we may be a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Our management is not aware of any litigation outstanding, threatened or pending as of the date hereof by or against us or our properties which we believe would be material to our financial condition or results of operations, except with respect to a dispute related to its non-renewal of the employment agreement with Mr. Allan Pratt, the Company's former President and CEO, in which Mr. Pratt appears to be treating it as a termination which would trigger a two-year severance payment. Around the same time that Mr. Pratt s employment term expired, the Company s Board of Directors voted to reduce the board from five to three, and Mr. Pratt and Mr. Austin Lewis, CFO, automatically rolled off from the Board of Directors. More than a year later, in 2021, Mr. Pratt filed a claim in Delaware courts to contest that decision. In July 2022, Mr. Pratt amended the complaint to dispute the proper authorization of a stock bonus that was awarded to the Company s CEO in March 2021. On November 9, 2023 the Delaware courts dismissed Mr. Pratt s claim relating to the board reduction from five to three. On December 5, 2024 the trial is scheduled to begin on the claims made in the Delaware courts.
