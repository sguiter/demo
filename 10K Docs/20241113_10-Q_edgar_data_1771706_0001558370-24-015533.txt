Entering into this settlement in no way changed the defendants position that they did nothing wrong and that the claims were baseless. Verano On January 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Arrangement Agreement with Verano, pursuant to which Verano was to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Vireo Growth pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, holders of Vireo Growth Shares would receive of a Verano Subordinate Voting Share, subject to adjustment as described below, for each Subordinate Voting Share held, and Verano Subordinate Voting Shares for each Multiple Voting Share and Super Voting Share held, immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement. On October 13, 2022, Vireo Growth received a notice of purported termination of the Arrangement Agreement (the Notice from Verano. The Notice asserted certain breaches of the Arrangement Agreement, including claims the Company s public filings and communications with respect to its business and ongoing operations were misleading and that the Company breached its representations to Verano under the Arrangement Agreement. Verano also claimed, as a result of such breaches, it is entitled to payment of a termination fee and its transaction expenses. Vireo Growth denies all of Verano s allegations and affirmatively asserts that it has complied with its obligations under the Arrangement Agreement, and with its disclosure obligations under US and Canadian law, in all material respects at all times. The Company believes that Verano has no factual or legal basis to justify or support its purported termination of the Arrangement Agreement, which the Company determined to treat as a repudiation of the Arrangement Agreement. On October 21, 2022, Vireo Growth commenced an action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Verano after Verano wrongfully repudiated the Arrangement Agreement. The Company is seeking damages, costs and interest, based on Verano's breach of contract and of its duty of good faith and honest performance. On November 14, 2022, Verano filed counterclaims against the Company for the termination fee and transaction expenses described above. On July 31, 2023, the Company filed a requisition for adjournment of its application filed July 14, 2023, and set for hearing on July 31, 2023 to compel Verano s compliance with document production based upon the Company s belief that Verano was engaging in tactics to delay the litigation. Throughout 2023, the Company served lists of documents, reviewed document production from Verano, and prepared for examinations for discovery.

 million, as well as other costs and legal fees, based on Verano s breach of contract and of its duty of good faith and honest performance. Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation, it is not possible for Vireo Growth to predict the timing or final outcome of the legal proceedings against Verano or to determine the amount of damages, if any, that may be awarded. The damages sought will be significant and material given that Verano s breach left the Company in a vulnerable position resulting in the Company being constrained in its ability to fund growth initiatives that were desirable and that its competitors were able to undertake, most notably in Minnesota and New York markets.

Overview of the Company Vireo Growth is a cannabis company whose mission is to provide safe access, quality products and value to its customers while supporting its local communities through active participation and restorative justice programs. The Company is evolving with the industry and is in the midst of a transformation to being significantly more customer-centric across its operations, which include cultivation, manufacturing, wholesale and retail business lines. With our core operations strategically located in three limited-license markets through our state-licensed subsidiaries, we cultivate and manufacture cannabis products and distribute these products through our growing network of Green Goods and other retail dispensaries we own or operate as well as to third-party dispensaries in the markets in which our subsidiaries hold operating licenses. The termination of the Arrangement Agreement with Verano (as more fully described in Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies of our notes to our consolidated financial statement contained herein) gives rise to substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Company management is working with the Company s lenders, counsel, and other applicable parties to implement a plan to effectively mitigate the conditions giving rise to substantial doubt. Elements of this plan may include, but are not limited to, asset sales, debt restructuring, and capital raises. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company s continuance as going concern is dependent on its future profitability and implementation of the aforementioned plan. The Company may not be successful in these efforts.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three months ended September 30, 2023 Revenue We derived our revenue from cultivating, processing, and distributing cannabis products through our fourteen dispensaries in three states and our wholesale sales to third parties in three states. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 78 of our revenue was generated from retail dispensaries and 22 from the wholesale business. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, 82 of our revenue was generated from retail business and 18 from wholesale business. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Minnesota operations contributed approximately 46 of revenues, New York contributed 11 , and Maryland contributed 43 . For the three months ended September 30, 2023, Minnesota operations contributed approximately 48 of revenues, New York contributed 14 , and Maryland contributed 38 . Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 25,165,343, an increase of 490,198 or 2 compared to revenue of 24,675,145 for the three-months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue contributions from the Maryland business driven by the ramp up in adult-use sales, which commenced on July 1, 2023, partially offset by the decrease in New York revenues. Retail revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 19,740,787 a decrease of 406,287 or 2 compared to retail revenue of 20,147,074 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreased revenue contributions from the New York business. Wholesale revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 5,424,556, an increase of 896,485 compared to wholesale revenue of 4,528,071 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue contributions from the Maryland business driven by the ramp up in adult-use sales, which commenced on July 1, 2023.

Cost of sales represents the costs attributable to producing bulk materials and finished goods, which includes direct materials, labor, and certain indirect costs such as depreciation, insurance, utilities and valuation adjustments. Cannabis costs are affected by various state regulations that limit the

Table of Contents 
 sourcing and procurement of cannabis product, which may create fluctuations in gross profit over comparative periods as the regulatory environment changes. Cost of sales are determined from costs related to the cultivation and processing of cannabis and cannabis-derived products as well as the cost of finished goods inventory purchased from third parties and valuation adjustments. Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 12,841,373, an increase of 1,363,616 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, of 11,477,757. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 12,323,970, representing a gross margin of 49 . This is compared to gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023, of 13,197,388 or a 53 gross margin. The decrease was primarily attributable to sales pricing compression in Minnesota and Maryland, and a greater mix of wholesale sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024, relative to the three months ended September 30, 2023. We believe our current production capacity has not been fully realized and we expect future operations to benefit from increased revenue growth reflective of higher demand, increased product output and new product development. However, we expect gradual price compression as markets mature, which could place downward pressure on our retail and wholesale gross margins. Total Expenses Total expenses other than the cost of sales consist of selling costs to support customer relationships, marketing, and branding activities. It also includes a significant investment in the corporate infrastructure required to support ongoing business. Selling costs generally correlate to revenue. In the short-term as a percentage of sales, we expect selling costs to remain relatively flat. However, as anticipated positive regulatory developments in our core markets occur, we expect selling costs as a percentage of sales to decrease via growth in our retail and wholesale channels. General and administrative expenses also include costs incurred at the corporate offices, primarily related to personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and other professional service costs, as well as corporate insurance, legal and professional fees associated with being a publicly traded company. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to decrease as we realize revenue growth organically and through anticipated positive regulatory developments in our core markets. Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 8,472,523 an increase of 1,146,629 compared to total expenses of 7,325,894 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to a increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by the issuance restricted stock unit and option grants during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating Income before Other Income (Expense) and Income Taxes Operating income before other income (expense) and provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 3,851,447 a decrease of 2,020,047 compared to 5,871,494 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total Other Expense Total other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 6,392,805, a decrease of 1,227,715 compared to other expense of 7,620,520 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change is primarily attributable to increased other income driven by the increasing value of the warrants we hold in Grown Rogue.

The Company issued 12,500,000 Subordinate Voting Shares to the lenders in consideration for the credit facility amendment. These 15,000,000 shares were valued at 5,387,500 using a fair value per share of 0.431 and considered a deferred financing cost. Unless otherwise specified, all deferred financing costs are treated as a contra-liability, to be netted against the outstanding loan balance and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, 5,089,311 (December 31, 2023 - 1,524,531) of deferred financing costs remain unamortized.

 Convertible Notes On April 28, 2023, the Company closed on a new convertible debt facility which enables the Company to access up to 10,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (the Convertible Notes ). The convertible facility has a term of three years, with an annual interest rate of 12.0 , comprised of 6.0 cash and 6.0 PIK. The initial tranche's principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding in the amount of 2,000,000, plus all PIK and all other accrued but unpaid interest thereunder, is convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time by written notice to the Company, at a conversion price equal to 0.145. For each future tranche advanced, the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding, plus all PIK interest and all other accrued but unpaid interest thereunder, is convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time by written notice to the Company, at a conversion price equal to the lesser of 0.145 or a 20.0 premium over the 30-day volume weighted average price of the Company s Subordinate Voting Shares calculated on the day prior to the date on which each tranche is advanced, if permitted by the Canadian Securities Exchange. The lenders also have the right to advance any remaining undrawn funds on the convertible loan facility to the Company at any time. If the notes are not converted, the outstanding principal amount and unpaid PIK interest is due on April 30, 2026. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company closed eight additional tranches of Convertible Notes, which are convertible into Subordinate Voting Shares at a conversion price of 0.145. Total proceeds received from these tranches amounted to 8,000,000. In connection with this financing, the Company issued 6,250,000 warrants to purchase Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company to the lenders. These warrants have a five year term, a strike price of 0.145, and were valued at 497,055. The value of these warrants and other legal and administrative expenses amounting to 1,346,793 are treated as deferred financing costs. All deferred financing costs are treated as a contra-liability, to be netted against the outstanding loan balance and amortized over the remaining life of the loan. As of September 30, 2024, 0 (December 31, 2023 - 1,083,697) of deferred financing costs remain unamortized. On July 31, 2024, the holders voluntarily converted all outstanding convertible notes into 73,016,061 Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company. Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.8 million as compared to 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to less favorable changes in working capital, and reduced proceeds received from the Cares Employee Retention Credit in 2024 relative to 2023. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.2 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increased property, plant, and equipment additions relative to the prior year. Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a change of 1.4 million as compared to 2.0 million provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was principally due to the issuance of convertible during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Lease Transactions As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into lease agreements for the use of buildings used in cultivation, production and/or sales of cannabis products in Maryland, Minnesota, and New York.
