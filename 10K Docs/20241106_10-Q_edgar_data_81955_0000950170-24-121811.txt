RAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED SCHEDULE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS September 30, 2024 (Continued) (Unaudited) 
 Notes to the Consolidated Schedule of Portfolio Investments (a) of the fair value of the investment portfolio. Restricted securities are subject to one or more restrictions on resale and are not freely marketable. Type of investment for equity position is in the form of shares unless otherwise noted as units or interests, i.e., preferred shares, common shares. 

 (b) 

 (c) 

 (d) of the Co rporation s investments as Level 3 assets. Under the valuation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities on the last trading day of the reporting period. Restricted securities are subject to restrictions on resale and are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our external investment advisor Rand Capital Management, LLC RCM and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is considered to be the amount that the Corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date. Valuations as of any particular date, however, are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other dispositions of securities and these favorable or unfavorable differences could be material. Among the factors considered in determining the fair value of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results, projected operations, and other analytical data relating to the investment. Also considered are the market prices for unrestricted securities of the same class (if applicable) and other matters which may have an impact on the value of the portfolio company (see Note 3. Investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

 (e) 

 (f) million. Net unrealized appreciation was approximately million, which was comprised of million of unrealized appreciation of investment securities and million of unrealized depreciation of investment securities. At September 30, 2024 , the aggregate gross unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was million and the aggregate gross unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was million. The net unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was million based on a tax cost of million . 

 (g) 

 (h) 

 (i) from investments included as interest receivable on the Corporation s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. None at September 30, 2024 . 

 (j) 

 (k) and of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation. 

 (l) 

 (m) blocker corporation subsidiary of Rand Capital Corporation for federal income tax and Regulated Investment Company (RIC) compliance purposes. 

 (n) Indicates assets that the Corporation believes do not represent qualifying assets under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Qualifying assets must represent at least of the Corporation s total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. The Corporation had no non-qualifying assets as of September 30, 2024. 

 (o) of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation or where greater than of the board representation is maintained.

 (c) 

 (d) of the Corporation s investments as Level 3 assets. Under the valuation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities on the last trading day of the reporting period. Restricted securities are subject to restrictions on resale and are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our external investment advisor Rand Capital Management, LLC RCM and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is considered to be the amount that the Corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date. Valuations as of any particular date, however, are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other dispositions of securities and these favorable or unfavorable differences could be material. Among the factors considered in determining the fair value of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results, projected operations, and other analytical data relating to the investment. Also considered are the market prices for unrestricted securities of the same class (if applicable) and other matters which may have an impact on the value of the portfolio company (see Note 3. Investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

 (e) 

 (f) million. Net unrealized appreciation was approximately million, which was comprised of million of unrealized appreciation of investment securities and million of unrealized depreciation of investment securities. At December 31, 2023 , the aggregate gross unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was million and the aggregate gross unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was million. The net unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was million based on a tax cost of million.

East owns approximately of Rand Capital s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2024. Concurrent with the Closing, Rand Capital Management, LLC RCM ), a registered investment adviser, was retained by Rand as its external investment adviser and administrator (the Closing and the retention of RCM as our investment adviser and administrator are collectively referred to herein as the Transaction ). The term of our investment advisory and management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by our Board of Directors (the Board in October 2024 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. In addition, the term of the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by the Board in October 2024 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. The Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement can continue for successive annual periods after December 31, 2025 provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i)(A) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not interested persons, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of us, RCM or our respective affiliates. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee and may pay an incentive fee, if specified benchmarks are met. In connection with the Closing, we also entered into a shareholder agreement by and between Rand and East (the Shareholder Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, East has the right to designate two or three persons, depending upon the size of the Board, for nomination for election to the Board. East has the right to designate (i) up to two persons if the size of the Board is composed of fewer than seven directors or (ii) up to three persons if the size of the Board is composed of seven or more directors. East s right to designate persons for nomination for election to the Board under the Shareholder Agreement is the exclusive means by which East may designate or nominate persons for election to the Board. The Board currently consists of five directors, and Adam S. Gusky and Benjamin E. Godley are East's designees on the Board. We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements specified in the 1940 Act. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets and provide managerial assistance to the portfolio companies in which we invest. See Item 1. Business - Regulations, Business Development Company Regulations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In connection with the completion of the Transaction, we have shifted to an investment strategy focused on higher yielding debt investments and elected U.S. Federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company RIC ).

3 rd 

In order to continue to qualify as a RIC, Rand holds several of its equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries that facilitate a tax structure that is advantageous to the RIC election.

shares of par value preferred stock authorized and unissued. On May 7, 2024, the Board approved a share repurchase plan which authorizes the Corporation to repurchase shares of Rand s outstanding common stock with an aggregate cost of up to at prices per share of common stock no greater than the then current net asset value. This share repurchase authorization is in effect through May 7, 2025, and replaces the share repurchase authorization that was previously approved by the Board in April 2023. shares of Rand's common stock were repurchased by the Corporation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 . The Corporation reviews the tax positions it has taken to determine if they meet a "more likely than not threshold" for the benefit of the tax position to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. A tax position that fails to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold will result in either a reduction of a current or deferred tax asset or receivable, or the recording of a current or deferred tax liability. There were uncertain tax positions recorded at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Corporation may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Corporation determines that its estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, the Corporation accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The Corporation did t incur any federal excise tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Corporation incurred in federal excise tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Distributions from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal tax regulations, which may differ from amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and those differences could be material. These book-to-tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. Reclassifications due to permanent book-tax differences, including the offset of net operating losses against short-term gains and nondeductible meals and entertainment, have no impact on net assets. The Corporation is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended December 31, 2020 through 2023. In general, the Corporation s state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended December 31, 2020 through 2023. It is the Corporation s policy to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Corporation incurred in interest expense related to income tax liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . There were amounts recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

of the Corporation s investments were Level 1 investments and were Level 3 investments. There were Level 2 investments at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. In the valuation process, the Corporation values restricted securities categorized as Level 3 investments, using information from these portfolio companies, which may include: Audited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets; 

 Current and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company; 

 Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations; 

 The current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event were to occur; 

 Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company; 

 Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent financing transactions; 

 Current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed; 

 Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company; 

 Qualitative assessment of key management; and 

 Other factors deemed relevant to assess valuation. 

 The valuation may be reduced if a portfolio company s performance and potential have deteriorated significantly. If the factors that led to a reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be readjusted. Equity Securities Equity securities may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation s equity investments are EBITDA and revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational performance of the business, and the debt and senior equity preferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard industry multiples may be used when available; however, the Corporation s portfolio companies are typically privately-held, lower middle market companies and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational characteristics of the portfolio company. Due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may include third party appraisals. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate. Another key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction entered into by the portfolio company with a sophisticated, non-strategic, unrelated, new investor. The terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the Corporation, and the impact of the difference in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.

In addition, under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Corporation has also agreed to pay the Lender an unused commitment fee on a quarterly basis, computed as multiplied by the average daily Unused Commitment Fee Base (which is defined as the difference between (i) million and (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Corporation s outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility) for the preceding quarter.

The Incentive Fee is comprised of two parts: (1) the Income Based Fee and (2) the Capital Gains Fee . The Income Based Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in the Investment Management Agreement) for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a hurdle rate of per quarter annualized) and is payable promptly following the filing of the Corporation s financial statements for such quarter, to the extent the Income Based Fee exceeds Accrued Unpaid Income. The Corporation pays RCM an Incentive Fee with respect to its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (i) Income Based Fee in any quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter does not exceed the hurdle rate of annualized); 

 (ii) of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate of annualized) but is less than annualized); and 

 (iii) of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds annualized).

of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period (as defined below) minus (2) the aggregate Income Based Fee that was paid in respect of the calendar quarters included in the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period. For purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, Income Based Fee Calculation Period is defined as, with reference to a calendar quarter, the period of time consisting of such calendar quarter and the additional quarters that comprise the eleven calendar quarters immediately preceding such calendar quarter. For purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, Cumulative Net Return is defined as (1) the aggregate net investment income in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period minus (2) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Corporation pays no Income Based Fee to RCM for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Income Based Fee that is payable to RCM for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Corporation pays an Income Based Fee to RCM equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Income Based Fee that is payable to RCM for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Corporation pays an Income Based Fee to the Adviser equal to the Income Based Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. For purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, Net Capital Loss, in respect of a particular period, means the difference, if positive, between (1) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (2) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.	 Any Income Based Fee otherwise payable under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to Accrued Unpaid Income (as described below) (such fees being the Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees shall be deferred, on a security by security basis, and shall become payable to RCM only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received in respect of any Accrued Unpaid Income. Any Accrued Unpaid Income that is subsequently reversed in connection with a write-down, write-off, impairment or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to such Accrued Unpaid Income will, in the applicable period of reversal, (1) reduce Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and (2) reduce the amount of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees. For purposes of the Investment Management Agreement, Accrued Unpaid Income is defined as any net investment income that consists of any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, payment-in-kind interest, payment-in-kind dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities, that the Corporation has recognized in accordance with GAAP, but has not yet received in cash. Subsequent payments of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees that are deferred as provided for in the Investment Management Agreement shall not reduce the amounts otherwise payable for any quarter as an Income Based Fee. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Income Based Fees earned were . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , there were Income Based Fees earned under the Investment Management Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 , cumulative accrued Income Based Fees payable were , and after calculating Accrued Unpaid Income, none was immediately payable. As of December 31, 2023 , there were there were accrued Income Based Fees payable. The second part of the Incentive Fee is the Capital Gains Fee . This fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year. Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (2) the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from November 8, 2019. If this amount is positive at the end of any calendar year, then the Capital Gains Fee for such year is equal to of such amount, less the cumulative aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee payable for that calendar year. If the Investment Management Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the Capital Gains Fee. For purposes of the Capital Gains Fee: The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Corporations portfolio when sold minus (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 

 The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.

of this cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid, or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP, for all prior periods. However, unrealized capital appreciation is not used by the Corporation as part of the calculation to determine the amount of the Capital Gains Fee actually payable to RCM under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement. There can be no assurances that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. As of September 30, 2024 , there was Capital Gains Fee currently payable under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, and the final calculations are determined annually, and subject to change based on subsequent realized gains, losses or unrealized losses during the remainder of 2024. In accordance with GAAP, the Corporation is required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee on all realized and unrealized gains and losses, resulting in an accrual of at September 30, 2024 , which represents the fee that would be due based on net portfolio appreciation.

New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and we cannot predict all of them. Overview We are an externally managed non-diversified investment company that lends to and invests in lower middle market companies. Our investment objective is to generate current income and when possible, complement this current income with capital appreciation. As a result, our investments are primarily in higher yielding debt instruments. Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Rand Capital Management, LLC RCM ). We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements specified in the 1940 Act. In November 2019, Rand completed a stock sale transaction (the Closing with East Asset Management East ). The transaction consisted of a 25 million investment in Rand by East, in the form of cash and contributed portfolio assets, in exchange for approximately 8.3 million shares of Rand common stock. East owns approximately 64 of Rand Capital s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2024. Concurrent with the Closing, Rand Capital Management, LLC RCM ), a registered investment adviser, was retained by Rand as its external investment adviser and administrator (the Closing and the retention of RCM as our investment adviser and administrator are collectively referred to herein as the Transaction ). The term of the new investment advisory and management agreement (the Investment Management Agreement with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by our Board of Directors (the Board in October 2024 and will expire on December 31, 2025. In addition, the term of the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by the Board in October 2024 and will expire on December 31, 2025. The Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement can continue for successive annual periods after December 31, 2025 provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i)(A) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the

affirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not interested persons, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of us, RCM or our respective affiliates. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee and may pay an incentive fee, comprised of two parts: (1) the "Income Based Fee" and (2) the "Capital Gains Fee", if specified benchmarks are met. We elected U.S federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company RIC under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. In addition, as a RIC, we must distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90 of our ordinary net income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. Accordingly, our Board has regularly declared a quarterly cash dividend since our RIC election. Our 
 We may co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive relief order we received from the SEC, with certain of our affiliates. See SEC Exemptive Order below. We believe these types of co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and provide an ability to achieve greater diversification in our investment portfolio. 
 Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. A summary of our critical accounting policies can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The total investment income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was received from 21 portfolio companies. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, total investment income was received from 23 portfolio companies. Interest from portfolio companies Interest from portfolio companies was approximately 27 higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 due to the fact that we originated additional interest yielding investments during the last year. The new debt instruments were originated from FSS, ITA, Mattison, MRES, and Seybert's. Interest from other investments - The decrease in interest from other investments is primarily due to lower average idle cash balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023. Dividend and other investment income - Dividend income is comprised of cash distributions from limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations in which we have invested. Our investment agreements with certain LLCs require those LLCs to distribute funds to us for payment of income taxes on our allocable share of the LLC s profits. These portfolio companies may also elect to make additional discretionary distributions or dividends. Dividend income will fluctuate based upon the profitability of these LLCs and corporations and the timing of the distributions. The dividend distributions for the respective periods were:

Fee income - Fee income generally consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to the portfolio companies upon successful closing of financings, income from portfolio company board attendance fees, income associated with portfolio company monitoring fees, and other miscellaneous fees. The financing fees are amortized ratably over the life of the instrument associated with the fees. The unamortized fees are carried on the balance sheet under the line item Deferred revenue. The income associated with the amortization of financing fees was 52,803 and 38,565 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a prepayment fee of 146,300 from our debt investment in SciAps, a loan modification fee of 4,929 from our debt investment in SciAps, and a monitoring fee of 11,589 from our investment in First Coast Mulch. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a monitoring fee of 12,000 from our investment in First Coast Mulch. Expenses

The increase in total expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 354,300 increase in the capital gains incentive fee expense and a 178,218 increase in the income based incentive fee expense. The capital gains incentive fee accrual expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the calculation of the capital gains fee as required by GAAP. We are required under GAAP to accrue capital gains incentive fees on the basis of net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized gains and losses. Our capital gains incentive fee accrual reflects the capital gains incentive fees that would be payable to RCM if our entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date, even though RCM is not entitled to this capital gains incentive fee under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are realized. The increase in expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 can be attributed to realized capital gains during the quarter. The income based incentive fee is calculated quarterly in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement. The income based incentive fee accrued during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 178,218, and is due to an increase in

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income above the hurdle rate as set forth and described in the Investment Management Agreement. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during such calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for such calendar quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding any portion of the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, payment-in-kind interest, payment-in-kind dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities, that we have recognized in accordance with GAAP, but have not yet received in cash (collectively, Accrued Unpaid Income ). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized and unrealized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The income based incentive fee with respect to Accrued Unpaid Income shall be deferred, on a security by security basis, and shall become payable only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received. The Accrued Unpaid Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 exceeded the income based incentive fee for the third quarter of 2024, and therefore, no income based incentive fee is currently payable to RCM at September 30, 2024. Net Investment Income The excess of investment income over total expenses, including income taxes, represents net investment income. The net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 887,035 and 798,583, respectively. Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments

The increase in total expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 1,325,600 increase in the capital gains incentive fee expense, a 320,364 increase in interest expense, a 178,218 increase in income based incentive fee expense, a 164,663 increase in base management fees payable to RCM under the Investment Management Agreement, and a 44,825 increase in professional fees. The capital gains incentive fee accrual expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the calculation of the capital gains fee as required by GAAP.

The increase in expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 can be attributed to realized capital gains and increases in unrealized appreciation during the year. The increase in interest expense resulted from higher average outstanding debt balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 under the Credit Facility. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,028,198 and 707,834, respectively.

The base management fee payable to RCM is calculated based upon total assets less cash, and, as we deploy more capital into investments, the base management fee payable to RCM will increase accordingly. The base management fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 934,532 and 769,869, respectively. Professional fees expense increased by 44,825 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the same period in 2023, as we incurred increased fees associated with the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.

Table of Contents 

We account for our operations under GAAP for investment companies. The principal measure of our financial performance is "Net increase in net assets from operations" on our consolidated statements of operations. The net increase in net assets from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11,773,670 and 5,437,671, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet anticipated cash requirements, fund new and follow-on portfolio investments, pay distributions to our shareholders and respond to other general business demands. As of September 30, 2024, our total liquidity consisted of approximately 3,353,000 in cash and 21,100,000 of remaining availability on our Credit Facility. During 2022, we entered into a million Credit Facility. The amount we can borrow, at any given time, under the Credit Facility is tied to a borrowing base, which is measured as (i) 75 of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of the publicly traded equity securities we hold (other than shares of ACV Auctions, if any) plus (ii) the least of (a) 75 of the fair market value of the shares of ACV Auctions we hold, if any, (b) 6.25 million and (c) 25 of the aggregate borrowing base availability for the Credit Facility at any date of determination plus (iii) 50 of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of eligible private loans we hold that meet specified criteria plus (iv) the lesser of (a) 50 of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of unsecured private loans we hold that meet specified criteria and (b) 1.25 million minus (v) such reserves as the Lender may establish from time to time in its sole discretion. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of June 27, 2027. The outstanding balance drawn on the Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 was 3,900,000. Under the borrowing base formula described above, the unused line of credit balance for the Credit Facility was 21,100,000 at September 30, 2024. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) or (ii) 0.25 . At September 30, 2024, our applicable interest rate was 8.46 . The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants usual and customary for agreements of this type, including among others covenants that prohibit, subject to certain specified exceptions, our ability to merge or consolidate with other companies, sell any material part of our assets, incur other indebtedness, incur liens on our assets, make investments or loans to third parties other than permitted investments and permitted loans, and declare any distribution or dividend other than certain permitted distributions. The Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: (i) a tangible net worth covenant that requires us to maintain a Tangible Net Worth (defined in the Credit Agreement as our aggregate assets, excluding intangible assets, less all of our liabilities) of not less than 50.0 million, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter, (ii) an asset coverage ratio covenant that requires us to maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of the fair market value of all of our assets to the sum of all of our obligations for borrowed money plus all capital lease obligations) of not less than 3:1, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter and (iii) an interest coverage ratio covenant that requires us to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) of not less than 2.5:1, which is measured quarterly on a trailing twelve-months basis. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024. See Note 6. Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility on our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of our Credit Facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net increase in cash of approximately 57,000, which is a net effect of approximately 14,550,000 of net cash provided by our operating activities and approximately 14,492,000 of net cash used in our financing activities. The 14,550,000 of net cash provided by our operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from net investment income of approximately 1,208,000, approximately 24,852,000 from the sales of equity investments and repayments of debt investments, and an approximately 1,495,000 net increase in operating liabilities. This was partially offset by approximately 11,070,000 used to fund new or follow-on portfolio company investments, approximately 1,339,000 in non-cash interest income, and an approximately 499,000 net increase in operating assets. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 14,492,000. This is comprised of 12,350,000 repaid on the Credit Facility and approximately 2,142,000 in dividends paid to shareholders. We anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through cash generated through our ongoing operating activities and through borrowings under the 25 million Credit Facility. We anticipate that we will continue to exit investments. However, the timing of liquidation events with respect to our privately held investments is difficult to project.

Item 3. Quantitative and Quali tative Disclosures about Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuation of our investment portfolio. Interest Rate Risk Changes in interest rates may affect our interest expense on the debt outstanding under our Credit Facility. Our debt borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) and (ii) 0.25 . Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, all of our debt investments had fixed interest rates and were not directly impacted by changes in market interest rates. Based on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase (decrease) in net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates under our Credit Facility, assuming no changes in our borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Because we often borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between our borrowing rate and the rate we earn on the invested proceeds borrowed. In periods of rising interest rates, the rate we earn on our debt investments with fixed interest rates will remain the same, while the interest incurred on our borrowings under the Credit Facility will increase.

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity under our Credit Facility at September 30, 2024, it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality, size and composition of our investment portfolio, and other business developments, including borrowings under our Credit Facility, that could affect our net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis. We do not currently engage in any hedging activities. However, we may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our borrowed funds. Valuation Risk We carry our investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by RCM and approved by our Board. Determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio company investment while employing a consistent valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments, there may be material risks associated with this determination including that estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the value realized on these investments to be different than the valuations that are assigned. The types of factors that we may take into account in valuation of our investments include, as relevant, third party valuations, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly-traded securities, recent sales of or offers to buy comparable companies, and other relevant factors. Item 4. Controls an d Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that this information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation s controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.
