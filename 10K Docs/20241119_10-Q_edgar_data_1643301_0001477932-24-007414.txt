Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report, as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and the discussion under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on May 17, 2024 (our 2023 Annual Report ). Overview Avenir Wellness Solutions, Inc. Avenir and its wholly-owned subsidiaries including The Sera Labs, Inc. Sera Labs (collectively the Company, we, our, us, or Avenir is a broad platform technology company focusing on the development and manufacturing of nutraceutical formulation and delivery technologies in novel dosage forms to improve safety, efficacy and enhance wellness. Our mission is to improve lives by redefining how active ingredients are delivered and experienced. Our primary business model is to develop wellness products using our proprietary technology and may grant product rights to third parties responsible for marketing, sales and distribution, while retaining exclusive rights to produce and market, sell and distribute branded health, wellness, and beauty products through Sera Labs. We focus on evidence-based wellness products that are differentiated by using proprietary and/or proven active ingredients that we formulate for greater stability, overall quality and increased bioavailability. Wellness and beauty products can be cosmetics, over-the-counter or dietary supplements which do not require U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval but do require following all good manufacturing practices GMPs ). Thus, they are less costly and faster to launch in the marketplace than pharmaceutical products. Key Factors Affecting our Performance Due to a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods, and our results of operations may not be directly comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting our results of operations. Known Trends and Uncertainties Inflation The U.S. economy had recently been experiencing the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s. Historically, we have not experienced significant inflation risk in our business. However, our ability to raise our product prices depends on market conditions and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs. In addition, the global economy suffers from slowing growth and high interest rates, and many economists believe that a global recession may begin in the near future. If the global economy slows, our business would likely be adversely affected. Geopolitical Conditions In February 2022, Russia initiated military action against Ukraine. Russia s invasion, the responses of countries and political bodies to Russia s actions, and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility and could have adverse effects on regional and global economic markets. Following Russia s actions, various countries, including the United States among others, issued broad-ranging economic sanctions against Russia. The sanctions consist of the prohibition of trading in certain Russian securities and engaging in certain private transactions, the prohibition of doing business with certain Russian corporate entities, large financial institutions, officials and persons and the freezing of Russian assets. A number of large corporations and U.S. states have also announced plans to curtail business dealings with certain Russian businesses. The imposition of the current sanctions (and potential imposition of further sanctions) and other actions undertaken by countries and businesses may adversely impact various sectors of the Russian economy, and the military action has severely impacted the Ukrainian economy, including its exports and food production. The duration of ongoing hostilities and corresponding sanctions and related events cannot be predicted and may result in a negative impact on the markets and thereby may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, while we do not have any direct operations or significant sales in the Middle East, geopolitical tensions and ongoing conflicts in the region, particularly between Israel and Hamas, may lead to global economic instability and fluctuating energy prices that could materially affect our business. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of the Israel-Hamas war or other ongoing conflicts in the region, including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and actions taken by other countries in respect thereof, which could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. While it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, the Israel-Hamas war may increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 Table of Contents Supply Chain Global business interruptions may adversely impact our third-party relationships which we rely upon in our business as well as manufacturers, suppliers, and makers of raw materials. If any such parties are adversely impacted by supply chain restrictions, or if such third parties need to prioritize other products or customers over us, we may experience delays or disruptions in our supply chain, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. Seasonality Our business could be affected by seasonal variations. However, taken as a whole, seasonality does not have a material impact on our financial results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenue Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 192 thousand as compared to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Cost of goods sold decreased by 243 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the overall decrease in unit sales of our products.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We believe our current cash balance coupled with anticipated cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We cannot give assurance that we can increase our cash balances or limit our cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for our planned operations or future acquisitions. Future business demands may lead to cash utilization at levels greater than recently experienced. We may need to raise additional capital in the future. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. To date, we have funded our operations through cash generated from our product sales, issuance of common stock and promissory notes. On June 28, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a lender (the Lender ), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Lender two bridge notes in the principal amounts of (i) 49,450 including an original issue discount of 6,450 payable in four monthly installments beginning on December 30, 2024; and (ii) 72,450 including an original issue discount of 9,450 payable in ten monthly installments beginning on July 30, 2024, and additional tranches of up to 350,000 in the aggregate, subject to further agreement between the Lender and the Company. Net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in the aggregate amount of 100,000 (after the deduction of legal fees of 6,000) were received on July 2, 2024. We plan to use our cash within the twelve months from September 30, 2024 and beyond for working capital and other general corporate purposes including the development and procurement of product and for marketing and promoting our products and brands in furtherance of our strategic plan.

Correspondingly, net cash used in financing activities of 134 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the repayment of notes payable of 134 thousand. In the event that such working capital is insufficient, we may need to raise additional operating capital in the remainder of calendar year 2024 in order to maintain our operations and to realize our strategic plan. Without additional sources of cash and/or the deferral, reduction, or elimination of significant planned expenditures, we may not have the cash resources to continue as a going concern thereafter. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Our 2023 Annual Report contains additional information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. There have been no material changes to these policies reported in our 2023 Annual Report. Please refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for information regarding recently adopted accounting standards. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Information for this Item is not required as we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) of the Exchange Act are designed to ensure that: (1) information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (2) such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. There can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our Company and our consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Principal Accounting Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this assessment, management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Principal Accounting Officer, concluded that as of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result of the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. In making this assessment, management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company s internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. 38 Table of Contents Identified Material Weakness A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management identified two weaknesses in our internal control: 1. During the preparation of our 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified an error in the calculation of earnings per share (EPS) that affected the financial statements included in the second and third quarterly reports on Form 10-Q in 2021, the annual report on Form 10-K for 2021, and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2022. The error was attributed to a spreadsheet error which caused the incorrect calculation of the weighted average shares outstanding used to compute EPS. Upon discovery, we promptly initiated a comprehensive review of our EPS calculations and revised our reported EPS figures accordingly. 2. The segregation of duties as a material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions planned include: re-design of our accounting processes and control procedures implementing additional review and verification processes for the calculation of EPS, and other spreadsheet calculations and enhancing our training programs for personnel involved in the financial reporting process to prevent similar errors in the future; and identify gaps in our skills base and the expertise of our staff required to meet the financial reporting requirements of a public company. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to execute upon our planned remediation actions which are all intended to strengthen our overall control environment. The following are the primary remediation efforts made by us: prepare accounting memos relating to the debt issuances made by us during 2023 and 2022 which include derivative and warrants; review fair value of convertible promissory notes in relation to the Series A and B Notes; review of impairment of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangibles; and review periodic reports to ensure the appropriate disclosures are made within the SEC filed documents. Additionally, management has engaged a professional services firm with expertise in internal controls. To remediate the material weaknesses described above, management has initiated compensating controls in the near term and is enhancing and revising the design of existing controls and procedures to properly account for significant and unusual transactions. After several meetings between the consultants and key accounting personnel the following actions were completed: adoption of COSO; Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 SOX risk assessment memo; entity level COSO mapping; and SOX control narratives for financial reporting as well as other processes. While we believe these additions have addressed our lack of segregation of duties, due to the timing of the events, they were not able to mitigate the material weakness for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believe that these remediation efforts will represent significant improvements in our control environment.
