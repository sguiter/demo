accounting acquirer and the Company is treated as the accounting acquiree, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Intermediate issuing stock
for the net assets of CENAQ, accompanied by a recapitalization. The Business Combination is not treated as a change in control of Intermediate.
This determination reflects Holdings holding a majority of the voting power of Verde Clean Fuels, Intermediate s Pre-Business Combination
operations being the majority post-Business Combination operations of Verde Clean Fuels, and Intermediate s management team
retaining similar roles at Verde Clean Fuels. Further, Holdings continues to have control of the Board of Directors through its majority
voting rights. Under ASC 805, the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of Intermediate are recognized at their respective

-year land lease in Maricopa,
Arizona with the intent of building a renewable gasoline processing facility. On the commencement date, the present value of the minimum
lease payments exceeded the fair value of the land, and, accordingly, the lease was classified as a finance lease. On August 31, 2023,
the Company terminated the land lease in Maricopa, Arizona. In connection with the termination, the Company incurred a termination fee
of three months base rent. The termination was effective four months after the termination notice; thus, the Company had a continued
right-of-use and obligation to make rental payments for use of the land through December 31, 2023. The Company accounted for the termination
with a continued right-of-use as a lease modification resulting in a reclassification of the lease from finance to operating as of the
lease modification date. Accordingly, the Company incurred finance lease costs up to the modification date and operating lease costs subsequent
to the modification until lease termination. The Company exited the lease as of December 31, 2023.

Restricted Stock Units 

In April 2024, all of RSUs outstanding were vested. Of these
vested RSUs, were converted into an equal number of shares of the Company s Class A common stock, and the remaining 
were outstanding as of September 30, 2024, as the director elected to defer receipt. 

warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024.
Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of per share, subject
to adjustment as discussed below. However, no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless there is an effective and current registration
statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such
shares of Class A common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of the Business Combination,
warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to
maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9)
of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will
not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. In the event of such cashless exercise, each holder would pay the exercise
price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price
of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value 
for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of Class A common stock for the five trading days ending
on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. The warrants will expire on February 15, 2028, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or
earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

at any time after the warrants become exercisable; 

upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; 

if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any trading days within a -trading day period commencing at any time after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and 

if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Class A common stock underlying such warrants. 

If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company
may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable
state securities laws. 

An aggregate of warrants were exercised on various dates during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in the issuance of 29,216 shares of the Company s Class A common stock.

of a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. As a direct result of the Business Combination, OpCo became the sole member of
Intermediate. As such, OpCo s distributive share of any net taxable income or loss and any related tax credits of Intermediate are
then distributed to the Company. 

The Company s effective tax rate was for both the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and was for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
effective income tax rates for each period differed significantly from the statutory rate primarily due to the losses allocated to noncontrolling
interests and the recognition of a valuation allowance as a result of the Company s tax structure. The effective tax rate for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included a return to provision adjustment. 

The Company has assessed the realizability of its net deferred tax
assets and that analysis has considered the relevant positive and negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company has maintained a full valuation allowance against
its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024, which will be maintained until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal
of all or some portion of these allowances. 

The Company s income tax filings will be subject to audit by
various taxing jurisdictions. The Company will monitor the status of U.S. Federal, state and local income tax returns that may be subject
to audit in future periods. No U.S. Federal, state and local income tax returns are currently under examination by the respective taxing
authorities.

of the amount of net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income
and franchise tax that Verde Clean Fuels actually realizes (computed using certain simplifying assumptions) or is deemed to realize in
certain circumstances in periods after the Closing Date as a result of, as applicable to each such TRA Holder, (i) certain increases in
tax basis that occur as a result of Verde Clean Fuels acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
of all or a portion of such TRA Holder s Class C OpCo Units pursuant to the exercise of the OpCo Exchange Right, a Mandatory Exchange
or the Call Right (each as defined in the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement of OpCo) and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Verde
Clean Fuels as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments Verde Clean Fuels makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
Verde Clean Fuels will retain the benefit of the remaining of these net cash savings. The Tax Receivable Agreement contains a
payment cap of , which applies only to certain payments required to be made in connection with the occurrence of a change of
control. The payment cap would not be reduced or offset by any amounts previously paid under the Tax Receivable Agreement or any amounts
that are required to be paid (but have not yet been paid) for the year in which the change of control occurs or any prior years. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have a tax receivable

Noncontrolling Interests 

Following the Business Combination, holders of Class A common stock
own direct controlling interest in the results of the combined entity, while Holdings own an economic interest in the Company, shown as
noncontrolling interests NCI in stockholders equity in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The
indirect economic interests are held by Holdings in the form of Class C OpCo units. 

Following the completion of the Business Combination, the ownership
interests of the Class A common stockholders and the NCI were and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the ownership
interests of the Class A common stockholders and the NCI were and , respectively. The change in ownership interests was due
to warrant exercises during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as the settlement of the related party New Promissory Note
and the issuance of shares of Class A common stock as a result of RSUs vesting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Notes
4, 7 and 8 for further information. The NCI may further decrease according to the number of shares of Class C common stock and Verde Clean
Fuels OpCo LLC Class C units that are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock or due to the issuance of additional Class A common
stock. 

As a result of these exchanges, the Company s equity attributable
to the NCI and the Class A common stockholders was rebalanced to reflect the change in ownership percentage, as calculated based on the
respective ownership interests of the combined equity interests.

Overview 

Formation 

On July 29, 2020, Green Energy Partners, Inc. GEP ),
formed by the Chief Executive Officer of Bluescape Clean Fuels Intermediate Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Intermediate ),
and an additional individual (the Founders ), entered into an asset purchase agreement with Primus Green Energy, Inc. Primus to purchase the assets of Primus. The assets under the asset purchase agreement included a demonstration facility, a laboratory, office
space and intellectual property including the patented STG+ process technology. 

GEP then assigned its rights under the asset purchase agreement to
a newly formed subsidiary of Intermediate. Immediately following the closing of the asset purchase agreement, the Founders sold 100 of
their membership interests to BEP Clean Fuels Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company BEP in exchange for
agreeing to make the payments under the asset purchase agreement as well as other capital contributions and a contingent payment. BEP
ultimately contributed the membership interests to Intermediate. Intermediate holds the acquired assets through Bluescape Clean Fuels,
LLC. Since acquiring the assets from Primus, we have developed the use and application of the technology acquired to focus on the renewable
energy industry. 

The Transactions 

On February 15, 2023 (the Closing Date or Closing ),
the Company consummated a business combination (the Business Combination pursuant to that certain business combination
agreement, dated as of August 12, 2022 (the Business Combination Agreement by and among CENAQ Energy Corp. CENAQ ),
Verde Clean Fuels OpCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of CENAQ OpCo ), Bluescape
Clean Fuels Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Holdings ), Intermediate and CENAQ Sponsor LLC Sponsor ).
Immediately upon the completion of the Business Combination, CENAQ was renamed as Verde Clean Fuels, Inc. The Business Combination is
discussed further in Note 3 in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 

24 

Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, (i) (A) CENAQ contributed
to OpCo (1) all of its assets, excluding its interests in OpCo and the aggregate amount of cash required to satisfy any exercise by CENAQ
stockholders of their redemption rights (the Redemption Rights ), and (2) 22,500,000 shares of Class C common stock
(the Holdings Class C Shares and (B) in exchange therefor, OpCo issued to CENAQ a number of Class A common units of Opco
(the Class A OpCo Units equal to the number of total shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately
after the Closing taking into account the private offering of shares of Class A common stock and warrants consummated contemporaneously
with the Closing (the PIPE Financing and the exercise of Redemption Rights (such transactions, the SPAC Contribution and (ii) immediately following the SPAC Contribution, (A) Holdings contributed to OpCo 100 of the issued and outstanding limited liability
company interests of Intermediate and (B) in exchange therefor, OpCo transferred to Holdings (1) 22,500,000 Class C common units of OpCo
(the Class C OpCo Units and the Holdings Class C Shares. 

The Business Combination was accounted for as a common control reverse
recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The Business Combination was not a change in control of Intermediate. This
determination reflects Holdings holding a majority of the voting power of Verde Clean Fuels, Intermediate s pre-Business Combination
operations being the majority post-Business Combination operations of Verde Clean Fuels, and Intermediate s management team retaining
similar roles at Verde Clean Fuels. Further, Holdings continues to have control of the Company s Board of Directors through its
majority voting rights. 

Under the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 ), for transactions between entities under common control, the assets, liabilities,
and noncontrolling interests of CENAQ and Intermediate are recognized at their carrying amounts on the date of the Business Combination.
Under this method of accounting, CENAQ will be treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly,
for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Intermediate issuing stock for the net assets of CENAQ,
accompanied by a recapitalization. 

Subsequent to the Business Combination, the Company s capital
structure is comprised of shares of Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Class A common stock and shares
of Class C common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Class C common stock ). Public stockholders, the Sponsor, and the
investors in the PIPE Financing hold shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock, and Holdings
owns the Holdings Class C Shares and an equal number of Class C OpCo Units. 

Our Business 

We are a clean fuels company focused on the deployment of our
innovative and proprietary liquid fuels processing technology through development of commercial production plants. Our synthesis gas syngas )-to-gasoline plus (STG+ process converts syngas derived from diverse feedstocks, such as natural gas or
biomass, into fully finished liquid fuels that require no additional refining, such as reformulated blend-stock for oxygenate
blending RBOB gasoline. Unlike many other gas-to-liquids technologies, not only can our STG+ process produce
renewable gasoline from syngas, but we expect that it will be able to be applied at other production facilities to produce other end
products, including methanol. 

We acquired our STG+ technology from Primus, a company established
in 2007 that developed the patented STG+ technology to convert syngas into gasoline or methanol. Over 110 million has been invested
in our technology, including our demonstration facility in New Jersey, which has completed over 10,500 hours of operation producing gasoline
or methanol. Our demonstration facility represents the scalable nature of our operational modular commercial design which has fully integrated
reactors and recycle lines and is designed with key variables, like gas velocity and catalyst bed length, at a 1-to-1 scale with our commercial
design. 

25 

We are currently pursuing opportunities to deploy our technology through
development of commercial production plants to deliver scalable and cost-effective gasoline, and we believe that the availability of disadvantaged,
stranded or flared natural gas in various markets coupled with the economic upside and environmental impact of this resource presents
an opportunity to deploy our STG+ process in order to process such natural gas feedstock into full finished liquid fuels. We have
entered into a joint development agreement (the JDA with Cottonmouth Ventures LLC Cottonmouth ), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, Inc. Diamondback ), for the proposed development, construction, and operation of a facility
to produce commodity-grade gasoline using natural gas feedstock supplied from Diamondback s operations in the Permian Basin. In
addition to the project contemplated by the JDA with Cottonmouth, we are also evaluating other potential opportunities to deploy our technology
in other producing basins with similar large quantities of disadvantaged, stranded or flared natural gas. 

In addition, we have adapted the application of our STG+ technology
to process various biomass feedstocks into fully finished liquid fuels, including renewable gasoline. This adaptation requires a third-party
gasification system to produce acceptable syngas from renewable feedstocks. Our proprietary STG+ system converts the syngas into
gasoline. We have participated in carbon lifecycle studies to validate the scoring of carbon intensity, which we define as the quantity
of greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing, distributing, and consuming a fuel, per unit of fuel energy CI and reduced lifecycle emissions (the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, distribution, and consumption of a fuel)
of our renewable gasoline as well as fuel, blending and engine testing to validate the specification and performance of our gasoline product.
Our carbon intensity score is based on an analysis styled after the Department of Energy s Greenhouse gases Regulated Emissions,
and Energy use in Technologies life-cycle analysis. We believe our renewable gasoline, when paired with carbon capture and sequestration,
exhibits a significant lifecycle carbon emissions reduction compared to traditional petroleum-based gasoline. As a result, we believe
our gasoline produced from renewable feedstock, such as biomass, will qualify under the federal renewable fuel standard RFS program for the D3 renewable identification number, which could have significant value. Similarly, gasoline produced from our process
may also qualify for various state carbon programs, including California s low carbon fuel standard. In addition to our initial
focus on the production of renewable gasoline, we believe that there is opportunity to continue to develop additional process technology
to produce middle distillates including lower-carbon diesel and aviation fuel. As with other government programs, the use requirements
of the RFS program and other similar state-level programs are subject to change, which could materially harm our business strategy as
well as any ability to operate profitably. 

As of September 30,2024, we are still in the process of developing
our first commercial production facility and have not derived revenue from our principal business activities. 

Clean or lower-carbon as used in relation
to our products refers to the lower CI, lower lifecycle emissions, and lower quantity of greenhouse gas emissions resulting directly from
fuel combustion, relative to conventional gasoline derived from petroleum. Renewable as used in relation to our products
refers to energy or fuel derived from biomass feedstock. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Prospects and Future Results 

We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number
of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including competition from other carbon-based
and other non-carbon-based fuel producers, changes to existing federal and state level low-carbon fuel credit systems, and other factors
discussed under the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, and Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. We believe the factors described below are key to our success. 

Commencing and Expanding Commercial Operations 

Concurrent with the Business Combination, Diamondback through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Cottonmouth, made a 20 million equity investment in Verde and entered into an equity participation right agreement pursuant
to which Verde must grant Cottonmouth the right to participate and jointly develop facilities in the Permian Basin utilizing Verde s
STG+ technology for the production of gasoline derived from economically disadvantaged natural gas feedstocks. Diamondback is an
independent oil and natural gas company headquartered in Midland, Texas, focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation
of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The production of gasoline from natural gas
sourced from the Permian Basin is designed to allow Diamondback to mitigate the flaring of natural gas while also producing a high-margin
product from natural gas streams that are subject to being price disadvantaged compared to other natural gas basins. 

26 

On February 6, 2024, Verde and Cottonmouth entered into the JDA, which
provides a pathway forward for the parties to reach final definitive documents and final investment decision FID ). The
JDA frames the contracts contemplated to be entered into between the parties, including an operating agreement, ground lease agreement,
construction agreement, license agreement and financing agreements as well as conditions precedent to close such as FID. The expectation
for the project is to produce approximately 3,000 barrels per day of fully-refined gasoline utilizing Verde s patented STG+ 
process. We expect that the proposed facility, which is to be located in Martin County, Texas in the heart of the Permian Basin, could
serve as a template for additional natural gas-to-gasoline projects throughout the Permian Basin and other pipeline-constrained basins
in the U.S., as well as addressing flared or stranded natural gas opportunities internationally. 

On June 4, 2024, we announced the selection of Chemex Global, LLC Chemex as the contractor to spearhead the pre-front-end engineering and design FEED phase of the project contemplated by the
JDA. With the selection of Chemex, FEED work commenced and is expected to be completed in mid-2025. In connection with entering into the
JDA and the commencement of FEED, we began to incur development costs with respect to the project. Under the terms of the JDA, 65 
of the approved development costs that we incur (which includes the FEED costs) are reimbursed by Cottonmouth. Upon FEED completion and
reaching FID, it is anticipated that engineering, procurement and construction work will then commence, with the goal to complete construction
in 2027 . 

In August 2023, we announced a non-binding carbon dioxide management
agreement (the CDMA with Carbon TerraVault JV HoldCo, LLC, a carbon management partnership focused on carbon capture and
sequestration development formed between Carbon TerraVault, a subsidiary of California Resources Corporation CRC ), and
Brookfield Renewable Partners. The CDMA was subsequently amended in December 2023 to extend the term to the earlier of entry into a binding,
definitive agreement or December 31, 2024. Under the terms of the non-binding CDMA, we would construct a new renewable gasoline production
facility at CRC s existing Net Zero Industrial Park in Kern County, California, to capture carbon dioxide and produce renewable
gasoline from biomass and other agricultural waste feedstock to help support the further decarbonization of California s economy
and its transportation sector. It is anticipated that the project could produce up to 7 million gallons per year of renewable gasoline
for use as transportation fuel. 

In addition to the above, we have additional potential production facility
development opportunities in early-stage due diligence. We have identified opportunities to produce gasoline from natural gas in other
pipeline-constrained production areas as well as opportunities to produce renewable gasoline from biomass in locations with access to
suitable feedstock, carbon sequestration, and markets. We believe the number of identified and planned potential production facilities
bodes well for our potential growth. 

Successful Implementation of the first commercial facility 

A critical step in our business strategy will be the successful construction
and operation of the first commercial production facility using our patented STG+ technology. We believe that the first commercial
production facility could be operational as early as 2027. 

Protection and continuous development of our patented technology 

Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to protect,
commercialize and further develop our proprietary process technology and commercial facilities in a timely manner, and in a manner technologically
superior to and/or are less expensive than competing processes. 

Key Components of Results of Operations 

We are an early-stage company with no revenues, and our historical
results may not be indicative of our future results. Accordingly, the drivers of any future financial results, as well as any components
thereof, may not be comparable to our historical or future results of operations. 

27 

Revenue 

We have not generated any revenue to date. We expect to generate a
significant portion of our future revenue from the sale of renewable RBOB grade gasoline or gasoline derived from natural gas primarily
in markets with federal and state level low-carbon fuel credit systems. 

Expenses 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expenses consist of compensation costs including
salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting and other administrative functions.
General and administrative expenses also include legal fees, professional fees paid for accounting, auditing and consulting services,
and insurance costs. Following the Business Combination, we incurred and expect to continue to incur higher general and administrative
expenses for public company costs such as compliance with the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Research and Development Expense 

Our research and development R D expenses consist
primarily of internal and external expenses incurred in connection with our R D activities. These expenses include labor directly
performed on our projects and fees paid to third parties working on and testing specific aspects of our STG+ design and gasoline
product output. R D costs are expensed as incurred. We expect R D expenses to grow as we continue to develop the STG+ technology
and develop market and strategic relationships with other businesses. 

Contingent consideration 

Prior to the Business Combination, we had an arrangement payable to
our Chief Executive Officer and a consultant whereby a contingent payment would become payable if certain return on investment hurdles
were met within five years of an asset purchase arrangement. The contingent consideration was forfeited in connection with the Closing
of the Business Combination. 

Other Income 

Other income primarily consists of interest and dividend income earned
on our cash and cash equivalents balances. 

Income Tax Effects 

We hold 29.80 of the economic interest in OpCo, which is treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, OpCo generally is not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current
U.S. tax laws. We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to our distributive
share of the net taxable income (loss) and any related tax credits of OpCo. 

Intermediate was historically and remains a disregarded subsidiary
of a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. As a direct result of the Business Combination, OpCo became the sole member of
Intermediate. As such, OpCo s distributive share of any net taxable income or loss and any related tax credits of Intermediate are
then distributed to us.

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses increased approximately 0.2 million,
or 7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher
salaries and benefits of 0.2 million as a result of an increase in headcount. 

Research and Development 

R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were
consistent with the same period in 2023. 

Other Income 

Other income increased approximately 0.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest and dividend
income earned from our money market investment, which was approximately 19.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased approximately 0.1 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to our former land lease
in Maricopa, Arizona, which was classified as a finance lease until the third quarter of 2023, at which time the lease was modified and
reclassified to an operating lease. The lease was exited on December 31, 2023. See Note 5 in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements for further information. 

Income Taxes 

There was no provision for income taxes for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 due to a full valuation allowance that was recorded as of September 30, 2023, and maintained as of September 30, 2024.
The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to changes in estimate related to our 2022 tax obligation.

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses decreased approximately 0.8 million,
or 8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to 2.1 million
of unit-based compensation expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with the accelerated vesting of all
the outstanding series A incentive units and Founder incentive units as a result of the Business Combination. The decrease was partially
offset by higher salaries and benefits expense of 0.6 million attributable to an increase in headcount, higher professional fees of 0.5
million and higher share-based compensation expense of 0.4 million associated with restricted stock units granted in April 2023 and stock
options granted in April 2023 and May 2024. 

Contingent Consideration 

The 1.3 million change in contingent consideration for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 reflects the reversal during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of
the remaining accrual made by Holdings for certain contingent payments due to a contractual forfeiture of the payments following the close
of the Business Combination on February 15, 2023. See Note 2 in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for further
information. 

Research and Development 

R D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased
approximately 0.1 million, or 42 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits
expense attributable to an increase in headcount. 

Other Income 

Other income increased approximately 0.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest and dividend
income earned from our money market investment. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased approximately 0.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to our former land lease
in Maricopa, Arizona, which was classified as a finance lease until the third quarter of 2023, at which time the lease was modified and
reclassified to an operating lease. The lease was exited on December 31, 2023. 

Income Taxes 

The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
consisted of a refund received in connection with a previously paid income tax penalty. The income tax provision for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 was due to changes in estimate related to our 2022 tax obligation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024, we are still in the process of developing
our first commercial production facility and have not derived revenue from our principal business activities. We do not expect to generate
any meaningful revenue unless and until we are able to commercialize our first production facility. Since inception, we have incurred
operating losses and generated negative operating cash flows primarily attributable to our ongoing general and administrative expenses
and R D activities. 

We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements
of our development activities and our near-term business operations, including our contractual obligations and other commitments. Our
current liquidity needs primarily involve general and administrative expenses and R D activities for the ongoing development of our
first commercial production facility. In connection with entering into the JDA with Cottonmouth, a subsidiary of Diamondback, we have
begun to incur development costs with respect to the project, prior to reaching FID and entering into final definitive agreements, irrespective
of whether these events occur. We plan to invest approximately 3 million, net of the reimbursement from Cottonmouth, for FEED costs in
support of the Permian Basin natural gas-to-gasoline facility. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 21.7
million. We expect that our current cash would be sufficient to continue funding ongoing general and administrative expenses and R D
activities prior to reaching FID for our first commercial production facility and for at least the next 12 months. We further expect that
additional capital will be required, either in the form of equity or project finance, in order to continue development and construction
of a commercial production facility. 

Summary Statement of Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash
and cash equivalents for the periods presented below:

31 

Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities decreased 0.1 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest
and dividend income and a decrease in cash paid for D O insurance, mostly offset by higher operating expenses, including salaries
and benefits and professional fees. 

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities increased 0.4 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to development costs
incurred in connection with the JDA upon commencement of the FEED in June 2024, partially offset by cash reimbursements for such capital
expenditures received from Cottonmouth. See Notes 6 and 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. 

Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was zero for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37.5 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of the net proceeds received from the Closing of the Business Combination and PIPE
Financing. Following the Business Combination and the Closing of the PIPE Financing, we received approximately 37.3 million in cash,
net of approximately 10.0 million of transaction expenses and the repayment of approximately 3.8 million of capital contributions made
by Bluescape Clean Fuels Holdings, LLC since December 2021. The gross amount, before expenses, was composed of approximately 19.0 million
release from CENAQ s Trust Account, after payment of approximately 158.8 million to public stockholders who exercised redemption
rights (representing a redemption rate of approximately 89.3 ), and 32.0 million of proceeds from the PIPE Financing. We also received
 0.1 million from the CENAQ operating account. 

Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet
arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our unaudited consolidated financial statements are based on the selection
and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
that would result in materially different results. 

We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 3 Significant
Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We discuss our critical
accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations in our
2023 Form 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 2 in the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, as of September
30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period
covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

33 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we and our subsidiaries may be parties to legal
proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. We and our subsidiaries are currently not a party, nor is our property subject,
to any material pending legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because
of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will
be obtained. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in
the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on
March 28, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results
of operations.
