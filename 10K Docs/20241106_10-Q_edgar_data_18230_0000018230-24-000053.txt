 For certain contracts, we invoice for payment when contractual milestones are achieved. We recognize a contract asset when a sale is recognized before achieving the contractual milestones for invoicing. We reduce the contract asset when we invoice for payment and recognize a corresponding trade receivable. Contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized million and million, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is billion, with about one-half of the amount expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the following September 30, 2024. We have elected the practical expedient not to disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts. 
 
 See Note 16 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.

 We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any foreign currency forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. We perform designation on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME T foreign currency contracts are undesignated. 
 
 In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.

 Deferred Compensation Plan Liability Risk 
 
 We are also exposed to variability in compensation expense related to certain non-qualified deferred compensation obligations to employees.

 We enter into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within ME T and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts. Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable for contracts due on the same date and in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions. The master netting agreements may also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event.

 Cat Financial provides guarantees to purchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SPC s assets of billion and billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC s liabilities of billion and billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper.

 -year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets. We do not include goodwill amortization expense in segment profit. In addition, we have allocated to segments only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later. 
 
 We generally manage currency exposures for ME T at the corporate level and do not include in segment profit the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year. We report the net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting as a methodology difference. 
 
 We do not include stock-based compensation expense in segment profit. 
 
 Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference. 
 
 We determine ME T segment profit on a pretax basis and exclude interest expense and most other income/expense items. We determine Financial Products Segment profit on a pretax basis and include other income/expense items. 
 
 Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 32 to 33 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows: 
 
 Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization. 
 
 Restructuring income/costs: May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments, contract terminations and (gains)/losses on divestitures. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs, which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. See Note 20 for more information. 
 
 Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.

 Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and generally requires physical damage insurance coverage on the financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions. 
 
 Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cat Financial's forecasts reflected a continuation of the trend of historically low unemployment rates as well as low delinquencies within their portfolio. However, industry delinquencies show an increasing trend as the central bank actions aimed at reducing inflation have weakened global economic growth. The company believes the economic forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends. 
 
 Dealer 
 Cat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form of wholesale financing plans. Cat Financial's wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers.

 Credit quality of finance receivables 
 At origination, Cat Financial evaluates credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit ratings, loan-to-value ratios, probabilities of default, industry trends, macroeconomic factors and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. In determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire finance receivable past due when any installment is over days past due.

 Finance receivables in Cat Financial's Customer portfolio segment are substantially secured by collateral, primarily in the form of Caterpillar and other equipment. For those contracts where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, repayment of the outstanding amounts is generally expected to be provided through the operation or repossession and sale of the equipment.

 Non-accrual finance receivables 
 
 Recognition of income is suspended and the finance receivable is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable. Contracts on non-accrual status are generally more than days past due. Recognition is resumed and previously suspended income is recognized when collection is considered probable. Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms. Interest earned but uncollected prior to the receivable being placed on non-accrual status is written off through Provision for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, it is considered uncollectible.

 There were finance receivables in Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024. There were million in finance receivables in Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2023, all of which was in Latin America. 
 
 Modifications 
 
 Cat Financial periodically modifies the terms of their finance receivable agreements. Typically, the types of modifications granted are payment deferrals, interest-only payment periods and/or term extensions. Many modifications Cat Financial grants are for commercial reasons or for borrowers experiencing some form of short-term financial stress and may result in insignificant payment delays. Cat Financial does not consider these borrowers to be experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications for borrowers Cat Financial does consider to be experiencing financial difficulty typically result in payment deferrals and/or reduced payments for a period of or longer, term extension of or longer or a combination of both. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were finance receivable modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment. The amortized cost basis of finance receivables modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the Customer portfolio segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was million and million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented percent and percent of Cat Financial's Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively.

 million and million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented percent and percent of Cat Financial's Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively. 
 
 Fo r the three months ende d September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of term extensions for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty added a weighted average of and months, respectively, to the terms of modified contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of term extensions for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty added a weighted average o f and months, res pectively, to the terms of modified contracts. For t he three months en ded September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulted in weighted average paymen t deferrals and/or interest only payment periods of and months, respectively. For the nine months e nded September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulted in weighted average paymen t deferrals and/or interest only payment periods of and months, respectively. 
 
 After Cat Financial modifies a finance receivable, they continue to track its performance under its most recent modified terms. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, defaults of loans modified in the prior twelve months were not significant. 
 
 The effect of most modifications made to finance receivables for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses based on the methodologies used to estimate the allowance; therefore, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. On rare occasions when principal forgiveness is provided, the amount forgiven is written off against the allowance for credit losses.

 In addition to the amounts above, certain Cat Financial loans are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are classified as Level 3 measurements. A loan is measured at fair value when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable and the loan is individually evaluated. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had loans carried at fair value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Overview 
 Total sales and revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were 16.106 billion, a decrease of 704 million, or 4 percent, compared with 16.810 billion in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume . The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users. In addition, changes in dealer inventories had an unfavorable impact to sales volume. Dealer inventory increased less during the third quarter of 2024 than during the third quarter of 2023. 
 Third-quarter 2024 profit per share was 5.06, compared with 5.45 profit per share in the third quarter of 2023. In the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, profit per share included restructuring costs. Profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.464 billion, a decrease of 330 million, or 12 percent, compared with 2.794 billion for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the profit impact of lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization .

 Trends and Economic Conditions 
 Outlook for Key End Markets 
 Our results continue to reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets. 
 In Construction Industries, we expect lower sales of equipment to end users in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, but remain positive about the longer-term demand outlook. In North America, we anticipate lower sales of equipment to end users in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower rental fleet loading, consistent with the trend in the second and third quarters of 2024. However, dealer rental revenue continues to grow. In addition, government-related infrastructure projects are expected to remain healthy, supported by funding yet to be spent from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). In Asia Pacific , outside of China, we expect soft economic conditions to continue. We anticipate demand in China will remain at a relatively low level in the excavator industry above 10-tons. In EAME , we anticipate that weak economic conditions in Europe will continue, to be partially offset by continued healthy construction demand in the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America remains healthy, and we are expecting modest growth to continue. In addition, we anticipate the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact Construction Industries. 
 In Resource Industries, for both mining and heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we continue to anticipate lower machine sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, we expect the year-over-year rate of decline for sales of equipment to end users to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to previous quarters. We expect higher services revenues, including robust rebuild activity. Customer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains relatively low, the age of the fleet remains elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to have strong customer acceptance. Customers continue to display capital discipline, however, we continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth. 
 In Energy Transportation, Power Generation demand is expected to remain strong, and we expect robust growth for reciprocating engines and for turbines and turbine-related services in the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the full-year as compared to 2023. Overall strength in Power Generation continues to be driven by data center growth related to cloud computing and generative artificial intelligence (AI), and we expect this trend to continue. For Oil Gas, in total, we expect a stronger year overall in 2024 as compared to 2023. For turbines and turbine-related services used in Oil Gas applications, we expect a strong fourth quarter of 2024, but sales are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the timing of deliveries. We expect the increase in sales for turbines and turbine-related services used in Power Generation will mostly offset the decrease in sales for turbines and turbine-related services used in Oil Gas. Overall, we expect roughly flat sales in turbines and turbine-related services in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Turbines and turbine-related services has a strong backlog as well as healthy order and inquiry activity, and we continue to expect growth for turbines and turbine-related services in Oil Gas in 2024 as compared to 2023. After a strong 2023, we expect reciprocating engine sales for Oil Gas to be slightly down in 2024, primarily due to ongoing softness in well servicing. We still expect gas compression for reciprocating engines used in Oil Gas to be up in 2024 as compared to 2023, however, we expect it to soften in the near-term as equipment lead times have normalized. Industrial demand is expected to remain at a relatively low level in 2024 as compared to 2023. In Transportation, we anticipate growth in 2024 for both rail services and marine applications. 
 Fourth-Quarter 2024 Company Trends and Expectations 
 In the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect slightly lower total sales and revenues as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, impacted by lower machine sales of equipment to end users. Machine dealer inventory is expected to decrease less during the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the 1.4 billion decrease during the fourth quarter of 2023. We expect machine dealer inventory at the end of 2024 to be around the same level as the end of 2023. Price realization for machines is expected to trend lower with the normalizing pricing environment, partially offset by favorable price realization in Energy Transportation. Services revenues increased in the third quarter of 2024, and the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives are expected to positively impact sales in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect favorable manufacturing costs and lower selling, general and administrative (SG A) and research and development (R D) expenses to be more than offset by the profit impact of lower sales volume. Lower SG A/R D expenses are expected to be primarily driven by lower short-term incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 For the three primary segments, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect lower Construction Industries' sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 driven by lower sales of equipment to end users and unfavorable price realization. Resource Industries' sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to be slightly lower driven by lower sales of equipment to end users as compared to a strong fourth quarter of 2023. In Energy Transportation, we expect sales to be slightly higher supported by strength in Power Generation.

 In the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, within Construction Industries, we expect unfavorable price realization, partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs. In Resource Industries, we anticipate an unfavorable profit impact from lower sales volume and higher SG A/R D expenses as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives for future long-term profitable growth, such as services growth and technology, including autonomy, alternative fuels, connectivity and digital and electrification, to be partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs. In Energy Transportation, we expect favorable price realization. 
 Full-Year 2024 Company Trends and Expectations

The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization of 1.292 billion, the absence of the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 of 586 million and favorable manufacturing costs of 247 million, partially offset by the profit impact of lower sales volume of 1.106 billion, higher SG A/R D expenses of 262 million, higher restructuring costs of 220 million and unfavorable currency impacts of 105 million. Favorable manufacturing costs largely reflected lower freight. The increase in SG A/R D expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring costs increased primarily due to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities. 
 Operating profit margin was 20.9 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 19.7 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Other Profit/Loss and Tax Items 
 Interest expense excluding Financial Products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 405 million, compared with 385 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to higher average borrowing rates. 
 Other income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was income of 387 million, compared with income of 354 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Unfavorable foreign currency impacts were more than offset by favorable impacts from pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan costs and higher investment and interest income. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 21.4 percent compared to 22.4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the discrete items discussed below, the estimated annual tax rate was 22.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The 2024 estimated annual tax rate excludes the impact of year-to-date losses of 164 million for the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities with related tax benefits of 54 million. The 2023 estimated annual tax rate excludes the impact of the nondeductible loss of 586 million related to the divestiture of the company s Longwall business. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company recorded discrete tax benefits of 47 million to reflect changes in estimates related to prior years. In addition, a discrete tax benefit of 49 million was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 54 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the company recorded a discrete tax benefit of 88 million due to a change in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Sources of funds 
 
 We generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our ME T operations. Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. On a consolidated basis, we had positive operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 and ended the third quarter with 5.64 billion of cash, a decrease of 1.34 billion from year-end 2023. In addition, ME T invests in available-for-sale debt securities and bank time deposits that are considered highly liquid and are available for current operations. These ME T securities were 1.77 billion as of September 30, 2024 and are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. 
 
 Consolidated operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2024 was 8.64 billion, down 240 million compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to changes in accrued wages, salaries and benefits, and higher cash taxes paid, partially offset by lower working capital requirements, excluding changes in accrued wages, salaries and benefits. Within working capital, changes in inventory, accounts payable and receivables favorably impacted cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period, partially offset by unfavorable changes in accrued expenses. 
 
 Total debt as of September 30, 2024 was 37.90 billion, an increase of 23 million from year-end 2023. Debt related to ME T decreased 886 million in the first nine months of 2024 while debt related to Financial Products increased 966 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management s allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME T as of September 30, 2024 was 2.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows: 
 In August 2024, we entered into a new 364-day facility. The 364-day facility of 3.15 billion (of which 825 million is available to ME T) expires in August 2025. 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 In August 2024, we amended and extended the three-year facility (as amended and restated, the "three-year facility"). The three-year facility of 2.73 billion (of which 715 million is available to ME T) expires in August 2027. 
 In August 2024, we amended and extended the five-year facility (as amended and restated, the "five-year facility"). The five-year facility of 4.62 billion (of which 1.21 billion is available to ME T) expires in August 2029. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Caterpillar s consolidated net worth was 19.46 billion, which was above the 9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined in the Credit Facility as Caterpillar's consolidated shareholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Cat Financial s covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.46 to 1. This was above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain (loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarter period, required by the Credit Facility. 
 
 In addition, at September 30, 2024, Cat Financial s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 6.77 to 1. This was below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. 
 
 In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial s other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
 
 The aforementioned financial covenants are being reported as calculated under the Credit Facility and not pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the credit agreements governing the Credit Facility filed as an exhibit to our periodic reports for further information related to the calculation thereof. For risks related to our indebtedness and compliance with these covenants, please refer to the risk factor "Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility" set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Our total credit commitments and available credit as of September 30, 2024 were: 
 
 September 30, 2024 (Millions of dollars) Consolidated Machinery, Energy Transportation Financial Products Credit lines available: Global credit facilities 10,500 2,750 7,750 Other external 4,253 617 3,636 Total credit lines available 14,753 3,367 11,386 Less: Commercial paper outstanding (3,214) (3,214) Less: Utilized credit (781) (781) Available credit 10,758 3,367 7,391 
 
 The other external consolidated credit lines with banks as of September 30, 2024 totaled 4.25 billion.

 We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Fitch maintains a "high-A" debt rating, while Moody s and S P maintain a mid-A debt rating. A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME T s operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. 
 
 We facilitate voluntary supplier finance programs (the Programs through participating financial institutions. We account for the payments made under the Programs, the same as other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of the programs will have a significant impact on our liquidity. Additional information related to the programs is included in Note 21 "Supplier finance programs" of Part I, Item 1 "Financial Statements." 
 
 Machinery, Energy Transportation 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 7.73 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared with net cash provided of 7.96 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit before taxes, adjusted for non-cash items, changes in accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits, and higher cash taxes paid. These were partially offset by lower working capital requirements, excluding the impact of changes in accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits. Within working capital, changes in inventory, receivables and accounts payable favorably impacted cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period, partially offset by changes in accrued expenses. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 1.01 billion, compared with net cash used of 3.89 billion in the first nine months of 2023. The change was due to lower new investments in securities and higher proceeds from maturities and sale of securities, primarily due to time deposit maturities in 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Net cash used for financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 10.04 billion, compared with net cash used of 4.18 billion in the same period of 2023. The change was primarily due to higher payments to repurchase shares and debt repayments in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows: 
 
 Strong financial position Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies. 
 
 Operational excellence and commitments Capital expenditures were 1.28 billion during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1.11 billion for the same period in 2023. We expect ME T s capital expenditures in 2024 to be about 2.0 billion. We made 221 million of contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during the first nine months of 2024. We currently anticipate full-year 2024 contributions of approximately 273 million. In comparison, we made 320 million of contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders We intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings, services and sustainability, including acquisitions.

 As part of our capital allocation strategy, ME T free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We define ME T free cash flow as cash from ME T operations less capital expenditures, excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions. A goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all ME T free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating. 
 
 Our share repurchase plans are subject to the company s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company, corporate cash flow, the company s liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities. In May 2022, the Board approved a share repurchase authorization (the 2022 Authorization) of up to 15.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective August 1, 2022, with no expiration. In June 2024, the Board approved an additional share repurchase authorization (the 2024 Authorization) of up to 20.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock, effective June 12, 2024, with no expiration. In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 7.06 billion of Caterpillar common stock, with 20.8 billion remaining under the 2022 and 2024 Authorizations as of September 30, 2024. Our basic shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were approximately 483 million. 
 
 Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company s dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers corporate cash flow, the company s liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In October 2024, the Board of Directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing 1.41 per share, and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend. Dividends paid totaled 1.97 billion in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Financial Products 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 1.02 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 905 million for the same period in 2023. Net cash used for investing activities was 1.90 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 1.25 billion for the same period in 2023. The change was primarily due to portfolio related activity and the divestiture of a non-U.S. entity. Net cash provided by financing activities was 890 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 122 million for the same period in 2023. The change was due to a higher net inflow from external borrowings and the absence of dividends paid to Caterpillar. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 New accounting guidance of Part I, Item 1 "Financial Statements." 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 For a discussion of the company s critical accounting estimates, see Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

OTHER MATTERS 
 
 Information related to legal proceedings appears in Note 14 "Environmental and legal matters" of Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements. 

Retirement Benefits 
 We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We will record the annual mark-to-market adjustment as of the measurement date, December 31, 2024. It is difficult to predict the December 31, 2024 adjustment amount, as it will be dependent primarily on changes in discount rates during 2024, and actual returns on plan assets differing from our expected returns for 2024.

 Order Backlog 
 
 At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 28.7 billion, about 0.1 billion higher than the second quarter of 2024. The order backlog increased in Energy Transportation, while Construction Industries and Resource Industries decreased. Of the total backlog at September 30, 2024, approximately 6.8 billion was not expected to be filled in the following twelve months. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We provide the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. 
 We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of four significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring income/costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024, (ii) other restructuring income/costs, (iii) restructuring costs related to the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 and (iv) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments in 2023. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing our period-over-period results. 
 Reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are as follows: 
 (Dollars in millions except per share data) Operating Profit Operating Profit Margin Profit Before Taxes Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Profit Profit per Share Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP

 We believe it is important to separately disclose our annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items for our results to be meaningful to our readers. The annual effective tax rate is discussed using non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of amounts associated with discrete items recorded fully in the quarter they occur. These items consist of (i) restructuring income/costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024, (ii) the impact of changes in estimates related to prior years in 2024, (iii) settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense, (iv) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments in 2023, (v) the decrease in the annual effective tax rate in 2023 and (vi) restructuring costs related to the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023. We believe the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company's period-over-period results.

Supplemental Consolidating Data 
 
 We are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis. The data has been grouped as follows: 
 
 Consolidated Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Machinery, Energy Transportation We define ME T as it is presented in the supplemental data as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. ME T s information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products. 
 
 Financial Products We define Financial Products as it is presented in the supplemental data as our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment. 
 
 Consolidating Adjustments Eliminations of transactions between ME T and Financial Products. 
 
 The nature of the ME T and Financial Products businesses is different, especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items. Caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences. We believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business. 
 
 Pages 69 to 76 reconcile ME T and Financial Products to Caterpillar Inc. consolidated financial information. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
