F- 9 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following information should be read in conjunction with (i) the financial statements of Agentix Corp., a Nevada corporation (the Company ), and development stage company, and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q together with (ii) the more detailed business information and the March 31, 2024 audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Form 10-K (File No. 000-55383; the Form 10-K ), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forward-looking statements. Company Overview We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 18, 2013 and we initially established a fiscal year end of August 31. In March 2022, we changed our year end to March 31. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results: Basis of Accounting Our financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), and with the rules and regulations of the SEC to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the reporting period ended March 31, 2024 and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision We account for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 4 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023: We recorded no revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

For the six months ended September 30, 2023, we received R D credits totaling 198,371 related to our R D efforts that occurred at our Agentix Australia Pty Ltd entity. We did not receive any R D credits for the comparable period ended September 30, 2024. 5 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit, we did not incur any revenue and we had a net loss along with negative cash generated from our operations. In addition, we owe our vendors and related parties 2,968,568 as of September 30, 2024. Although, on January 15, 2023 and June 15, 2023, we entered into two separate Mezzanine Secured Note Notes in the principal amount up to 200,000 and 500,000, respectively, with Gray s Peak Private Credit LLC (see Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements), the debt maturity of these Notes is short term. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, our cash position is not sufficient to support our daily operations. As such, we will need to raise funds to complete our plan of operation and fund our ongoing operational expenses for the next 12 months. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or debt financing. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company and if we obtain debt financing, the terms of any such debt financing may not be favorable to existing shareholders. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or obtaining debt to fund our development activities and ongoing operational expenses. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our development to complete our plan of operation and our business will fail. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Subsequent Events In accordance with ASC 855, we have analyzed our operations subsequent to September 30, 2024 through the date these financial statements were issued, and have determined that other than 5,000 received on October 8, 2024 from Gray s Peak Capital Note Payable (see Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financials statements) we don t have any other material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements. 6 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. As a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of Rehan Huda, a director, who acts as both our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, is responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, Mr. Huda concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 7 Table of Contents PART II.
