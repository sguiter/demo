_____________________________ (1) Debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of approximat ely million an d million, respectively, relating to our Revolving Credit Facility are not included in Unamortized debt issuance cost. They are included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in Intangible and other assets, net. 

 (A) The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an initial maximum of million, with an option to increase the maximum by an additional million (which amount is uncommitted). Availability is subject to a borrowing base and an availability block of million, which is applied against the million initially reducing the maximum (which can be removed by us at our sole discretion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions). The Revolving Credit Facility provides for a sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed million, with the outstanding amount of any such letters of credit reducing availability for borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, our Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and had approximately million of ava ilability, based on our eligible collateral. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is on the earlier of (i) the date that is 90 days prior to the earliest stated maturity date of the Senior Secured Notes, which is currently October 15, 2028, (unless refinanced or repaid) and (ii) December 21, 2028. The Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant, which requires that, solely if we elect to remove the million availability block, .00 . The financial covenant, if triggered, is tested monthly. The financial covenant was not triggered as of September 30, 2024. 

 Interest accrues on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of us, either (a) term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR for a period of one month (with a fallback to the prime rate if such rate is unavailable), plus , plus an applicable margin of or (b) term SOFR for a period of one, three or six months (at our election), plus , plus an applicable margin of , in each case with a floor of . (B) We previously issued at par an aggregate total of million principal value of our Senior Secured Notes due Senior Secured Notes ). The Senior Secured Notes, which mature in October 2028 , bear interest at a rate of paid in arrears on May 15 and October 15. Please see Note 5 in our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of the Senior Secured Notes. From time to time, we have engaged in open market repurchases to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance. 

 We did t repurchase any of our Senior Secured Notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we repurchased million in principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes for approximately million which was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. Including our write-off of the associated remaining portion of unamortized debt issuance costs, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of approximately million. (C) In August 2020, we entered into a million secured financing arrangement with an affiliate of Eldridge Industries, L.L.C. Eldridge ). Beginning in September 2020, million due in August 2025 . This financing arrangement is secured by an ammonia storage tank and is guaranteed by LSB.

 million MMBtus of natural gas that cover a period from October 2024 through December 2024. The weighted-average price of the natural gas covered by these contracts was per MMBtu, for a total of million. Based on strip prices, the weighted-average market price of the fixed contracts was per MMBtu for a total of million. Legal Matters - Following is a summary of certain legal matters involving the Company: A. Environmental Matters Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and to other laws regarding health and safety matters (collectively, the Environmental and Health Laws ), many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Certain Environmental and Health Laws impose strict liability as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety effects of our operations. There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. The Environmental and Health Laws and related enforcement policies have in the past resulted and could in the future result, in significant compliance expenses, cleanup costs (for our sites or third-party sites where our wastes were disposed of), penalties or other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials at or from our facilities or the use or disposal of certain of its chemical products. Further, a number of our facilities are dependent on environmental permits to operate, the loss or modification of which could have a material adverse effect on their operations and our financial condition. Historically, significant capital expenditures have been incurred by our subsidiaries in order to comply with the Environmental and Health Laws and significant capital expenditures are expected to be incurred in the future. We will also be obligated to manage certain discharge water outlets and monitor groundwater contaminants at our facilities should we discontinue the operations of a facility. As of September 30, 2024 , our accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled approximately million relating primarily to the matters discussed below. Estimates of the most likely costs for our environmental matters are generally based on preliminary or completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar matters. It is reasonably possible that a change in the estimate of our liability could occur in the near term. 1. Discharge Water Matters Each of our manufacturing facilities generates process wastewater, which may include cooling tower and boiler water quality control streams, contact storm water and miscellaneous spills and leaks from process equipment. The process water discharge, storm-water runoff and miscellaneous spills and leaks are governed by various permits generally issued by the respective state environmental agencies as authorized and overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. These permits limit the type and volume of effluents that can be discharged and control the method of such discharge. In 2017, the Company filed a Permit Renewal Application for its Non-Hazardous Injection Well Permit at the Pryor Facility. Although the Injection Well Permit expired in 2018, we continue to operate the injection well in accordance with an executed November 2023 Consent Order with the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality ODEQ that allows for the continued use of the injection well until a wastewater treatment process is designed, built and operational. The Company continues to work with the ODEQ under the terms of the Consent Order. We have identified and selected a wastewater treatment technology using biological processes that can and will treat the nitrogen-containing wastewater streams at our Pryor Facility. We are unable to estimate the costs related to the replacement of the disposal well at this time as we are in the early stages of design for the wastewater treatment process with a wastewater process design engineering firm. We have also commenced preliminary discussions with the ODEQ on permitting the treated wastewater discharges but have not received any confirmation from the ODEQ on their preliminary acceptance of our treated wastewater stream. 

 12 

LSB INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

 liability has been established as of September 30, 2024, in connection with this ADEQ matter. 2. Other Environmental Matters In 2002, certain of our subsidiaries sold substantially all of their operating assets relating to a Kansas chemical facility (the Hallowell Facility but retained ownership of the real property where the facility is located. Our subsidiary retained the obligation to be responsible for and perform the activities under, a previously executed consent order to investigate the surface and subsurface contamination at the real property, develop a corrective action strategy based on the investigation and implement such strategy. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries agreed to indemnify the buyer of such assets for these environmental matters. As the successor to a prior owner of the Hallowell Facility, Chevron Environmental Management Company Chevron has agreed in writing, within certain limitations, to pay and has been paying one-half of the costs of the investigation and interim measures relating to this matter as approved by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (the KDHE ), subject to reallocation. During this process, our subsidiary and Chevron retained an environmental consultant that prepared and performed a corrective action study work plan as to the appropriate method to remediate the Hallowell Facility. During 2020, the KDHE selected a remedy of annual monitoring and the implementation of an Environmental Use Control EUC ). This remedy primarily relates to long-term surface and groundwater monitoring to track the natural decline in contamination and is subject to a 5-year re-evaluation with the KDHE. The final remedy, including the EUC, the finalization of the cost estimates and any required financial assurances remains under discussion with the KDHE. Pending the results from our discussions regarding the final remedy, we continue to accrue our allocable portion of costs primarily for the additional testing, monitoring and risk assessments that could be reasonably estimated, which amount is included in our accrued liabilities for environmental matters discussed above. The estimated amount is not discounted to its present value. As more information becomes available, our estimated accrual will be refined, as necessary. We received a NOV for ten findings identified from an inspection conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA Region IV at our Cherokee Facility in late 2022. We provided written responses to each finding in the inspection report issued in connection with such inspection and to the Notice of Potential Violations and held direct communications with the EPA related to the matter. A meeting was held with the EPA in January 2024 to discuss the NOV and our subsequent responsive actions. During the meeting, the EPA proposed two alternatives for the penalties related to the violations. We accepted one of the proposed alternatives, which included a cash fine and an investment in a community project, for which we accrued an estimate as of December 31, 2023. B. Other Pending, Threatened or Settled Litigation Global Industrial Matter In 2015, we and EDA received written notice from Global Industrial, Inc. Global of Global s intention to assert mechanic liens for labor, service, or materials furnished under certain subcontract agreements for the improvement of the ammonia plant Ammonia Plant at our El Dorado Facility. Global was a subcontractor of Leidos Constructors, LLC Leidos ), the general contractor for EDA for the construction of the Ammonia Plant. Leidos terminated the services of Global with respect to their work performed at our El Dorado Facility. LSB and EDA are pursuing the recovery of any damage or loss caused by Global s work performed through their contract with Leidos at our El Dorado Facility. In March 2016, EDC and LSB were served a summons in a case styled Global Industrial, Inc. d/b/a Global Turnaround vs. Leidos Constructors, LLC et al., in the Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas (the Union County Trial Court ), wherein Global sought damages under breach of contract and other claims. At the time of the summons, our accounts payable included invoices totaling approximately million related to work performed by Global that is the subject of the claims asserted by Global, but such invoices were not approved by Leidos for payment. We have requested indemnification from Leidos under the terms of our contracts, which they have denied. As a result, we are seeking reimbursement of legal expenses from Leidos under our contracts. We

 million (including the million referred to above) for labor, service and materials furnished relating to the Ammonia Plant on the basis of what the Union County Trial Court called a claim for nonpayment of invoices, (ii) approximately million for prejudgment interest on the same claim, and (iii) a lien on certain property and foreclosure on the lien to satisfy the monetary obligations of the judgement. In addition, post-judgment interest will accrue at the annual rate of until the judgment is paid. LSB appealed this judgment and on October 18, 2023, the Arkansas Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. The Arkansas Court of Appeal ruled that the lien was defective and therefore invalid, and that the claim for nonpayment of invoices was not a cause of action and reversed and remanded the judgment on that claim. In December 2023, the Arkansas Court of Appeal denied Global s request for rehearing and the Arkansas Supreme Court declined to hear Global s appeal. As a result, we do not expect to have any material continuing liability related to this matter and, in 2023, we reversed approximately million of payables and accrued liabilities, which related to approximately million in pre and post-judgement accrued interest and million of gross plant, property and equipment. These adjustments also impacted our results of operations for the twelve months ending December 31, 2023, through the reversals of approximately million of interest expense and of approximately million in previously recognized depreciation expense (a component of cost of sales) on the related plant, property and equipment. LSB retains all of its claims against Leidos and intends to vigorously prosecute those claims and vigorously contest the cross-claims in Part (2) of the matter referred to above. We expect the trial to be set for the second half of 2025. No liability was established as of September 30, 2024, in connection with the cross-claims in Part (2) of the matter, except for certain invoices held in accounts payable. Section 382 Rights Plan Litigation A putative stockholder class action complaint, styled as Witmer v. Golsen, et al ., C.A. No. 2024-035-PAF (the Action was filed on April 3, 2024 in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court of Chancery ). The plaintiff claimed, among other things, that the Board breached its fiduciary duty by adopting an Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 382 stockholder rights plan with antitakeover and entrenching measures designed to protect the Board s incumbency. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the Company s Section 382 rights plan (the Amended NOL Rights Agreement was not narrowly tailored as it carried a 4.9 trigger and an allegedly overbroad definition of Beneficial Ownership that aggregated shares subject to agreements, arrangements or understandings between stockholders related to voting or influencing the Company. The plaintiff further alleged that the Board also issued a false and misleading proxy statement when soliciting stockholder approval of the Amended NOL Rights Agreement. The Company disagreed with plaintiff s allegations, and asserts that terms of the Amended NOL Rights Agreement, including the definition of Beneficial Ownership, is a proportionate response to the threat of the occurrence of an ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC and the resulting risk of substantial impairment to its ability to benefit from its net operating loss carryforwards and its other tax attributes. On May 14, 2024, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the Action after the Company voluntarily made limited technical amendments to the Amended NOL Rights Agreement and amendments to its proxy statement. The Company issued the amended proxy statement on May 3, 2024. The Court of Chancery dismissed the Action and retained jurisdiction solely for the purpose of deciding any application of the plaintiff s counsel for an award of attorneys fees and expenses. On May 31, 2024, plaintiff s counsel filed their motion for an award of attorneys fee and expenses in the amount of million. The Company and the defendants in the Action opposed such relief. The parties fully briefed the motion and the Court held argument on October 4, 2024. On October 4, 2024, the Court awarded plaintiff million in attorneys fees and expenses in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued the million which is included in current accrued and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in connection with this matter. We are also involved in various other claims and legal actions (including matters involving gain contingencies) in the ordinary course of our business. While it is possible that the actual claims results could differ from our estimates, after consultation with legal counsel, we believe that any such differences will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was million benefit on pre-tax loss). The tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , was million provision on pre-tax income). For 2024, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to change in valuation allowance and nondeductible compensation, partially offset by state tax law changes. For 20 23, the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to deferred benefits from state tax law changes, partially offset by state taxes. We considered both positive and negative evidence in our determination of the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. Valuation allowances are reflective of our quarterly analysis of the four sources of taxable income, including the calculation of the reversal of existing tax assets and liabilities, the impact of financing activities and our quarterly results. Based on our analysis, we have determined that it is more-likely-than-not that all of our federal deferred tax assets and a portion of our state deferred tax assets will be utilized. We estimate an approximately million increase in the related valuation allowance associated with these state deferred tax assets will be recorded during the year as part of the estimated annual effective tax rate applied to ordinary income. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets. Changes in positive and negative evidence, including differences between estimated and actual results, could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A should be read in conjunction with a review of the other Items included in this Form 10-Q and our September 30, 2024 condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. A reference to a Note relates to a note in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. This MD A reflects our operating results, unless otherwise noted. Certain statements contained in this MD A may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Overview 
 General 
 LSB is headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and we manufacture and sell chemical products for the agricultural, industrial and mining markets. We own and operate three multi-plant facilities in Cherokee, Alabama, El Dorado, Arkansas and Pryor, Oklahoma and operate a facility on behalf of Covestro in Baytown, Texas. Our products are sold through distributors and directly to end customers primarily throughout the U.S. and other parts of North America. 
 Key Operating Initiatives for 2024 
 We expect our future results of operations and financial condition to benefit from the following key initiatives: 
 Investing to improve Environmental, Health Safety and Reliability at our Facilities while Supplying our Customers with Products of the Highest Quality. 

We believe that our operational progress over the past several years represents proof that high safety standards not only enable us to protect what matters, which is the well-being of our employees, but also translates into improved plant performance. In 2023 our Total Recordable Injury Rate was 0.33, a significant improvement from previous years. In 2024, we remain focused on our efforts to further the progress we have made with our safety programs to move closer to attaining zero injuries. We have been investing and plan to continue to invest additional capital at all three of our facilities during 2024 to build upon the success we have had in implementing enhanced safety programs during the last several years. 

We have multiple initiatives underway focused on continuing to improve the reliability of our plants as we advance towards our ammonia on-stream operating rate target and increase our production volumes of ammonia and other downstream products. Progress towards these targets would enable us to produce greater volumes of product for sale while lowering our unit cost of production thereby increasing our overall profitability. Additionally, our product quality program continues to focus on providing products to our customers that meet our quality standards. 

Continue Optimization and Increase the Breadth of Distribution of our Product Mix. We have initiatives underway to increase the distribution of our products within our industrial end markets, among other product mix optimization strategies. We believe that these initiatives and strategies, combined with continued expansion of our customer relationships, the robust market analysis capabilities we have developed, and the establishment of in-market tank storage and distribution terminals, will make us more effective in identifying and capitalizing on the most profitable distribution opportunities for our products, while making our financial results more stable and predictable. Additionally, we are advancing several capital improvement projects with the intention of increasing our sales volumes of higher value downstream products resulting in improvements in our overall profit margins. 

Development of Low Carbon Ammonia and Clean Energy Projects. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly related to carbon dioxide, has been and we expect will increasingly become a global environmental priority. Ammonia has continued to emerge as one of the more viable alternatives to serve as a hydrogen-based energy source for a variety of applications due to its higher energy density and ease of storage relative to hydrogen gas. Low-carbon ammonia can be used as a coal and natural gas substitute in power generation, a zero-carbon fuel in the maritime sector, and as a carbon free fertilizer. If low-carbon ammonia were to be adopted for these and other energy needs globally, some studies have indicated that future demand could increase from current levels of global annual production of ammonia. 

As a result, we are currently continuing to evaluate and develop projects that could enable us to become a producer and marketer of low-carbon ammonia and other derivative products. These include a low-carbon ammonia project at our El Dorado facility in collaboration with Lapis Energy and a low-carbon ammonia project on the Houston Ship Channel in conjunction with INPEX Corporation INPEX ), Air Liquide Group Air Liquide and Vopak Exolum Houston LLC (f/k/a Vopak Moda Houston LLC), a joint venture between Royal Vopak and Exolum Vopak Exolum ). Low-carbon ammonia is produced using natural gas and conventional processes but includes an additional stage where the carbon dioxide emissions are captured and permanently stored in deep underground rock formations. The resulting low carbon emission product, we believe, can be sold at a premium to power generation, marine, industrial, mining and agricultural customers seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and potentially capitalize on government incentives. 
 18 

We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and become a market leader given our potential to retrofit our existing plants, which we believe can reduce our time to market for low-carbon ammonia and also reduce the upfront capital expenditures necessary to enable us to produce this product. Additionally, we are collaborating with other energy-related companies to develop greenfield projects where we expect to mitigate risk through shared investment of capital as well as by negotiating potential offtake agreements from customers for the output of these plants. 
 Evaluate and Pursue Organic Capacity Expansion. We have been evaluating opportunities across all our facilities to increase production capacity through the implementation of several potential debottlenecking projects, particularly at our El Dorado facility. Initial feasibility studies have pointed to potentially attractive returns for some of these projects. However, given the current high-cost environment and limited resources, coupled with our outlook for moderating selling prices, we have elected to put the El Dorado expansion projects on hold for the current year. We plan to reevaluate these projects in 2025 to determine our prospects of moving forward with one or more of them in the future. 

We have recently undertaken several smaller projects that we expect to enhance our profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. These projects include: 

Construction of additional AN solution storage and new AN solution rail loading capability at our El Dorado facility to significantly increase the volume of AN solution sales and increase product optionality at the site; 

Construction of 5,000 tons of additional nitric acid storage at our El Dorado facility to help us optimize our product sales mix; and 

Expansion of our urea capacity at our Pryor facility, to enable to use a portion of the facility s ammonia output to upgrade to approximately 75,000 additional tons of UAN per year. 

Evaluate Acquisitions of Strategic Assets or Companies. We may evaluate opportunities to acquire strategic assets or companies where we believe those acquisitions will enhance the value of the Company and provide attractive returns. We may consider assets and companies that can provide us with geographic expansion, extend an existing product line, add one or more new product lines, leverage our existing ammonia production capabilities, or complement our existing business lines, among other accretive opportunities. 

Recent Business Developments 
 Advanced Low-Carbon Ammonia Initiatives 
 In May 2024, we announced an agreement to supply up to 150,000 short tons per year of low carbon ammonium nitrate solution ANS to Freeport Minerals Corporation Freeport ). LSB will supply the ANS from its El Dorado, Arkansas facility for 5 years commencing January 1, 2025, with a phasing in of the low carbon contracted volume. Freeport intends to use the low carbon ANS purchased from LSB for its United States copper mining operations. 
 In October 2023, we announced a collaboration with INPEX, Air Liquide and Vopak Exolum to conduct a pre-FEED for the development of a large-scale, low-carbon ammonia production and export project on the Houston Ship Channel. If the development proceeds, the project s first phase is targeted to produce more than 1.1 million metric tons per year of low-carbon ammonia by early 2029, with options for future production expansions. 
 The parties completed a feasibility study on the project during the first quarter of 2023 and the proposed facility s location on the Houston Ship Channel, the second largest petrochemical corridor in the world, leverages existing infrastructure assets. Vopak Exolum has invested in storage and handling infrastructure for bulk liquid products and currently operates an ammonia terminal that includes storage tanks and a newbuild dock with multiple deep-water berths. The project also has access to utilities and would be near multiple pipelines that could supply raw materials like natural gas and water. 
 The project partners will bring complementary expertise to the production, operation, storage and export for the advancement of low-carbon ammonia production in the US: 
 Air Liquide, a world leader in industrial gas production, and INPEX, Japan s largest energy exploration and production company, would collaborate on low-carbon hydrogen production. Air Liquide would supply its Autothermal Reforming ATR technology, an ideal solution for large-scale hydrogen production projects, combined with its proprietary carbon capture technology. The combination of ATR technology with carbon capture aims to capture at least 95 of direct CO 2 emissions from hydrogen production with approximately 1.6 million metric tons per year of CO 2 captured and permanently sequestered from this project. Air Liquide would also be responsible for onsite nitrogen and oxygen production, using its proprietary Air Separation Unit technology. 

INPEX and LSB would collaborate on low-carbon ammonia production. LSB led the selection of KBR Inc. as the ammonia loop technology provider, and will lead the pre-FEED, engineering, procurement and construction of the facility. LSB would also be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the ammonia loop. 

19 

INPEX and LSB would sell the low-carbon ammonia and finalize off-take agreements with the numerous parties that have expressed interest and could also further partner in the project. The ammonia from this facility is intended to be used as a clean fuel for power generation, a hydrogen carrier, an industrial chemical feedstock, and as a marine fuel in a variety of domestic and international markets. INPEX, with stakes in both hydrogen and ammonia production, will likely be the largest investor in the overall project across the entire value chain, from production to export. 

Vopak Exolum currently operates ammonia storage and handling infrastructure from its Very Large Gas Carriers-capable deepwater berth located in the deepest part of the Houston Ship Channel. Vopak Exolum will maintain its ownership of the existing infrastructure and plans to build additional storage capacity as required to handle the low-carbon ammonia production from the proposed new facility. 

In May 2023, we entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the "MOU") with Amogy Inc. Amogy aimed at developing the adoption of low-carbon ammonia as a marine fuel, initially for the U.S. inland waterways transportation sector. Through joint efforts, we and Amogy will focus on advancing the understanding, utilization, and advocacy of low-carbon ammonia as a sustainable fuel. Pursuant to the MOU, the companies will collaborate on the evaluation and development of a pilot program that integrates our low-carbon ammonia and Amogy s ammonia-to-power solution. Upon successful completion of the evaluation and pilot program, the companies expect to further collaborate at a larger-scale, including exploration of opportunities for development of an end-to-end supply chain of low-carbon ammonia and deployment of Amogy technology across multiple applications, including maritime vessels. The evaluation and pilot program includes potential engagement with other parties across the ammonia value chain. We will also collaborate on various advocacy, education, and outreach efforts regarding the use of ammonia as a fuel. 
 In April 2022, we entered into an agreement with Lapis Energy to develop a project to capture and sequester CO 2 at our El Dorado, Arkansas facility. Lapis, backed by Cresta Fund Management, a Dallas-based middle-market infrastructure investment firm, will invest the majority of the capital required for project development. The project is expected to be completed and operational in 2026, subject to the approval of a Class VI permit, at which time CO 2 injections are expected to begin. Once operational, the project at the El Dorado site will initially capture and sequester approximately 400,000 to 500,000 metric tons of CO 2 per year in underground saline aquifers. The sequestered CO 2 generated from the facility s ammonia production is expected to qualify for federal tax credits under Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q, which are 85 per metric ton of CO 2 captured and sequestered. Lapis, as the majority owner of the carbon capture and sequestration equipment, will earn the 45Q tax credits and will pay us a fee for each ton of CO 2 captured and sequestered beginning in 2026. Once in operation, the sequestered CO 2 is expected to reduce LSB s overall scope 1 GHG emissions by approximately 25 from current levels. In addition, sequestering approximately 400,000 to 500,000 metric tons of CO 2 annually is expected to enable LSB to produce approximately 305,000 to 380,000 metric tons of low-carbon ammonia annually, a product that could potentially be sold at higher price levels than conventional ammonia. In February 2023, a key milestone was achieved in the advancement of our low-carbon ammonia project at El Dorado by filing a pre-construction Class VI permit application with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA ). The EPA recognized the application as complete in March 2023 and is currently in the review process. 
 Higher Ammonia Prices and Lower Natural Gas Input Costs Partially Offset by Impact of Planned Turnaround of Pryor Facility 
 Third quarter results benefited from higher ammonia selling prices and lower natural gas feedstock costs relative to the third quarter of 2023. Sales volumes of our products decreased in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same quarter of 2023 due to lower sales volumes of UAN and ammonia as a result of the Turnaround performed at our Pryor facility during the period. 
 Ammonia prices have strengthened over the past several months supported by a combination of global factors, including: tight U.S. and West-of-Suez supply-demand dynamics driven by global supply disruptions; geopolitical concerns over conflict in the Middle East leading to higher natural gas feedstock costs for European ammonia producers; extended turnarounds, outages and limited spot availability across the Middle East, North Africa and Trinidad that have reduced global inventories; ongoing disruptions in the Suez Canal limiting ammonia imports into Europe from the Middle East; and the delayed startup of new production capacity in the U.S. Gulf and export terminal in Russia. 
 We expect ammonia pricing to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 for a variety of reasons, including: the anticipated start-up of new production capacity in both the U.S. and internationally; an increase in Russian exports; and continued muted demand for nitrogen products from the global industrial sector, particularly in Asia. Upside to our pricing expectations could be driven by a variety of factors, including: an increase in energy prices; a strengthening Chinese economy driving increased industrial market demand; further delays in new production capacity coming online; gas curtailments in regions exporting ammonia; a lower interest rate environment; and supportive weather dynamics. 
 Demand for our industrial products is stable despite persistent global economic challenges. Nitric acid demand has been steady, reflecting the strength of the U.S. economy and robust consumer spending levels. Demand for AN for use in mining applications has been bolstered by positive exposure to copper, gold and iron ore, as well as continued attractive market fundamentals for aggregate production relating to infrastructure construction. While some degree of economic uncertainty persists, we believe that we have a meaningful degree of downside protection in our industrial business given our diverse customer base, the nature of our contracts and our ability to shift our production mix to products where demand and pricing are strongest. 
 20 

With respect to trends in our agricultural markets, corn prices have rebounded from earlier in 2024 reflecting recent revisions by the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA for smaller than previously estimated U.S. corn supplies and a modest decline in ending stocks; increases in U.S. corn exports and corn used for ethanol production; and production challenges in international growing regions. While currently above lows from earlier in 2024, corn prices sit below year-ago levels due largely to the impact on corn supply of the multi-year high U.S. corn harvest in 2023. Additionally, the USDA is currently estimating that U.S. farmers planted approximately 90.7 million acres of corn during the Spring 2024 planting season, down from 2023, but at a level that would increase corn supplies. 
 See a more detailed discussion below under Key Industry Factors. 
 Key Industry Factors 
 Supply and Demand 
 Fertilizer 
 The price at which our agricultural products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers which, in turn, depends upon world grain demand and production levels, the cost and availability of transportation and storage, weather conditions, competitive pricing and the availability of imports. Additionally, expansions or upgrades of competitors facilities and international and domestic political and economic developments continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen fertilizer industry economics. These factors can affect, in addition to selling prices, the level of inventories in the market which can cause price volatility and affect product margins. 
 From a farmer s perspective, the demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions including farm economics, weather and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors such as their financial resources, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. 
 Additionally, changes in corn prices, as well as soybean, cotton and wheat prices, can affect the number of acres of corn planted in a given year and the number of acres planted will drive the level of nitrogen fertilizer consumption, likely affecting prices. 
 According to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report dated October 11, 2024 October Report ), farmers planted approximately 90.7 million acres of corn in 2024, down 4.1 compared to the 2023 planting season. In addition, the USDA estimates the U.S. ending stocks for the 2024 Harvest will be approximately 50.8 million metric tons, a 13.6 increase from the 2023 Harvest. The USDA's expected yield for the 2024 Harvest is 183.8, up approximately 3.7 from a year ago.

The marketing year is the twelve-month period during which a crop normally is marketed. For example, the marketing year for the current corn crop is from September 1 of the current year to August 31 of the next year. The year begins at the harvest and continues until just before harvest of the following year.

The current USDA corn outlook for the U.S. calls for smaller supplies, larger exports, and reduced ending stocks . Corn production is forecast up on increased yield. Yield is increased to 183.8 bushels an acre, harvested area is unchanged and beginning stocks were lowered with total use raised slightly lowering ending stocks. From a demand perspective, corn prices have declined since early 2023 due largely to rising stocks-to-use ratios. 
 Industrial Products 
 Our industrial products sales volumes are dependent upon general economic conditions, primarily in the housing, automotive and paper industries. Demand for our industrial products is stable despite persistent global economic challenges. Nitric acid demand has been steady, reflecting the strength of the U.S. economy and robust consumer spending levels. Our sales prices generally vary with the market price of ammonia or natural gas, as applicable, in our pricing arrangements with customers. 
 21 

Our LDAN and AN solution, which are primarily used as AN fuel oil and specialty emulsions for usage in the quarry and the construction industries, are used for metals mining and to a lesser extent, for coal. Demand for AN for use in mining applications has been bolstered by positive exposure to copper, gold and iron ore, as well as continued attractive market fundamentals for aggregate production relating to infrastructure construction. While some degree of economic uncertainty persists, we believe that we have a meaningful degree of downside protection in our industrial business given our diverse customer base, the nature of our contracts and our ability to shift our production mix to products where demand and pricing are strongest. 
 Natural Gas Prices 
 Natural gas is the primary feedstock used to produce nitrogen fertilizers at our manufacturing facilities. In recent years, U.S. natural gas reserves have increased significantly due to, among other factors, advances in extracting shale gas, which has reduced and stabilized natural gas prices, providing North America with a cost advantage over certain imports. As a result, our competitive position and that of other North American nitrogen fertilizer producers has been positively affected. 
 We historically have purchased natural gas either on the spot market, through forward purchase contracts, or a combination of both and we have used forward purchase contracts to lock in pricing for a portion of our natural gas requirements. These forward purchase contracts are generally either fixed-price or index-price, short-term in nature and for a fixed supply quantity. We are able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to our connections to large distribution systems and their proximity to interstate pipeline systems. 
 The following table shows the volume of natural gas purchased and the average cost per MMBtu:

3.61 

Transportation Costs 
 Costs for transporting nitrogen-based products can be significant relative to their selling price. We continue to evaluate the recent rising costs of freight domestically. As a result of increases in demand for available rail, truck and barge options to transport product, primarily during the spring and fall planting seasons, higher transportation costs have and could continue to impact our margins if we are unable to fully pass through these costs to our customers. Additionally, continued truck driver shortages could impact our ability to fulfill customer demand. As a result, we continue to evaluate supply chain efficiencies to reduce or counter the impact of higher logistics costs. 
 Key Operational Factors 
 Facility Reliability 
 Consistent, reliable and safe operations at our chemical plants are critical to our financial performance and results of operations. The financial effects of planned downtime at our plants, including Turnarounds, are mitigated through a diligent planning process that considers the availability of resources to perform the needed maintenance and other factors. Unplanned downtime of our plants typically results in lost contribution margin from lost sales of our products, lost fixed cost absorption from lower production of our products and increased costs related to repairs and maintenance. All Turnarounds result in lost contribution margin, lost fixed cost absorption and increased repair and maintenance costs, which are expensed as incurred. 
 Our El Dorado Facility is currently on a three-year ammonia plant Turnaround cycle with the next ammonia plant Turnaround planned in the third quarter of 2025. However, we planned a short plant outage in July 2024 to perform a catalyst change to get back to maximum production rates. 
 Our Pryor Facility has completed its scheduled full plant Turnaround which commenced during the third quarter of 2024. Our Cherokee Facility commenced its scheduled ammonia plant Turnaround during the fourth quarter. Following those Turnarounds, they are expected to be on a two-year and three-year ammonia plant Turnaround cycle, respectively 
 22 

Ammonia Production 
 Ammonia is the basic product used to produce all of our upgraded products. The ammonia production rates of our plants affect the total cost per ton of each product produced and the overall sales of our products. For 2024, we are targeting total ammonia production of approximately 770,000 tons to 790,000 tons. 
 Forward Sales Contracts 
 We use forward sales of our fertilizer products to optimize our asset utilization, planning process and production scheduling. These sales are made by offering customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates that are agreed upon, with dates typically occurring within 90 days. We use this program to varying degrees during the year depending on market conditions and our view of changing price environments. Fixing the selling prices of our products months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment. 
 Consolidated Results of the Third Quarter of 2024 
 Our consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 109.2 million compared to 114.3 million for the same period in 2023. Our consolidated operating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was 24.4 million compared to operating loss of 9.5 million for the same period in 2023. The items impacting our operating results are discussed in more detail below and under Results of Operations. 
 Items Affecting Comparability of Results of the Third Quarter 
 Selling Prices 
 For the third quarter of 2024, average selling prices for our ammonia increased while other pricing remained flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. As discussed above under Recent Business Developments, prices have strengthened over the past several months supported by a combination of global factors, including: tight supply-demand dynamics driven by global supply disruptions; geopolitical concerns over conflict in the Middle East leading to higher natural gas feedstock costs; extended turnarounds, outages and limited spot availability reducing global inventories; ongoing disruptions in the Suez Canal limiting ammonia imports into Europe from the Middle East; and the delayed startup of new production capacity in the U.S. Gulf and export terminal in Russia. 
 Turnaround Activities (2024 only) 
 As discussed above, we performed major Turnaround activities at our Pryor Facility in the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, we planned and executed a minor planned outage at our El Dorado Facility during July to change the catalyst in the ammonia plant to maximize production rates. When such activities are performed, overall results are negatively impacted. This impact includes lost contribution margin from lost sales, lost fixed cost absorption from lower production, and increased costs associated with repairs and maintenance. In addition, Turnaround related costs may be incurred in periods earlier than the actual outage of the plant for activities such as planning and procurement of materials. 
 
 Plant, Property and Equipment Impairments 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded impairments on assets the Company has or intends to abandon in the amount of 5.4 million and 0.2 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded asset impairments of 6.8 million and 2.1 million, respectively. These impairment losses are included in Other expense (income), net on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and accompanying notes and the discussions under Overview and Liquidity and Capital Resources included in this MD A. 
 We present the following information about our results of operations. Net sales to unaffiliated customers are reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales. Net sales are reported on a gross basis with the cost of freight being recorded in cost of sales.

Net Sales 
 Net sales decreased during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period driven by the impact of lower volumes for UAN and ammonia, and to a lesser extent, lower selling prices for acids relative to the third quarter of 2023. Also impacting sales volumes was the planned Turnaround activity completed during the third quarter at our Pryor Facility. Partially offsetting this decrease was improved pricing for ammonia and increased acid sales volumes. 
 Demand for our industrial products is stable despite continued global economic challenges. In some cases, our contractual agreements with industrial customers specify minimum volumes and our product mix flexibility helps us mitigate the impact of a reduction in demand from certain end markets by shifting production to products with stronger demand. 
 Gross (Loss) 
 As noted in the table above, we recognized a gross loss of 7.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a gross loss of 3.4 million for the same period in 2023, or a 4.6 million increase. Overall, our gross loss percentage was (7.3) compared to a gross loss percentage of (3.0) for the same period in 2023. Our adjusted gross profit percentage increased to 22.9 for the third quarter of 2024 from 12.1 for the third quarter of 2023. Our overall gross loss for the third quarter of 2024 is primarily lower compared to the same period of 2023 due to lower sales prices and overall volume for our products, planned Turnaround expenses and higher depreciation partially offset by lower natural gas costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Our SG A expenses were 10.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 1.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. The net increase was primarily driven by increases in professional fees and payroll related items partially offset by a reduction in insurance, depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 8.1 million compared to 7.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase primarily relates to the reversal of the previous judgment awarded to Global in the litigation discussed in Note 5 during the third quarter of 2023. The increase was partially offset by reduced interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the lower outstanding balances on our 6.25 Senior Secured Notes (due to recent repurchases) and on our Secured Financing due 2025 (due to repayments). 
 Other Expense (income), net 
 Other expense (income), net during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to impairment losses from disposal or abandonment of assets no longer being used in operations offset by short-term rental income from railcar subleases. The losses were higher and rental income was lower in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Non-operating Other Income, net 
 Non-operating other income, net for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.7 million compared to 3.7 million for the same period of 2023, primarily related to interest income earned during both periods from our short-term investments. 
 Benefit provision for Income Taxes 
 The benefit for income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.5 million and the benefit for income taxes for the same period of 2023 was 5.2 million. The resulting effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 15.0 compared to 40.5 for the same period of 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to change in valuation allowance and nondeductible compensation. For the third quarter of 2023, the effective tax rate is greater than the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, valuation allowances, and other discrete items. See discussion in Note 7.

Net Sales 
 Net sales of our primary products decreased during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period driven by the impact of lower selling prices relative to the first nine months of 2023 for all of our products and lower sales volumes for ammonia. Partially offsetting weaker pricing was an increase in UAN sales volume driven by strong demand for fertilizers enhanced by our strategic commercial efforts. 
 Gross Profit 
 As noted in the table above, we recognized a gross profit of 41.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 74.3 million for the same period in 2023, or a 32.6 million reduction. Overall, our gross profit percentage was 10.8 compared to a gross profit percentage of 16.1 for the same period in 2023. Our adjusted gross profit percentage was 29.7 for the first nine months of 2024 and compared to 27.3 for the same period in 2023. Our overall gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 is lower compared to the same period of 2023 by overall lower sales prices for our products and higher planned Turnaround expenses partially offset by lower natural gas costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Our SG A expenses were 31.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 4.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. The net increase was primarily driven by increases in professional fees and payroll related items partially offset by a reduction in expense relating to insurance, other miscellaneous expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 26.3 million compared to 31.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease primarily relates to reduced interest expense as a result of the repurchase of our 6.25 Senior Secured Notes made beginning in the second quarter of 2023 and during 2024 along with a lower outstanding principal balance our Secured Financing due 2025. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 96.6 million of our Senior Secured Notes through open market transactions for approximately 92.2 million. As a result, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt, net of issuance costs, of approximately 3.0 million. During the first half of 2023, we repurchased 125.0 million of our Senior Secured Notes through open market transactions for approximately 114.3 million. As a result, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt, net of issuance costs, of approximately 8.6 million. 
 Other Expense (income), net 
 Other expense, net during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 consists primarily of impairment losses from disposal or abandonment of assets no longer being used in operations partially offset by short-term rental income from railcar subleases. The losses were higher and rental income was lower in the current year compared to the prior year. 
 Non-operating Other Income, net 
 Non-operating other income, net for the first nine months of 2024 was 9.1 million compared to 10.9 million for the same period of 2023, primarily related to interest income earned during both periods from our short-term investments. 
 (Benefit) provision for Income Taxes 
 The benefit for income taxes for the first nine months of 2024 was 2.6 million compared to the provision for income taxes of 3.6 million for the same period of 2023. The resulting effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 20.5 compared to 9.8 for the same period of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to change in valuation allowance and nondeductible compensation, partially offset by state tax law changes. For the nine months of 2023, the effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate primarily due to deferred benefits from state tax law changes, partially offset by state taxes. See discussion in Note 7.

Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 82.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 120.5 million for the same period of 2023, a change of 37.9 million. The decrease was primarily a result of a reduction in net sales, partially offset by lower cost of sales and lower cash interest paid. 
 Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used by investing activities was 18.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash provided of 21.5 million for the same period of 2023, a change of 39.9 million. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the net cash used primarily relates to purchases of short-term investments of 190.6 million and expenditures for PP E of 64.1 million partially offset by proceeds from short-term investments of 236.5 million. 
 For the first nine months of 2023, the net cash provided primarily relates to proceeds from short-term investments of 293.3 million, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of 230.7 million and expenditures for PP E of 41.0 million. 
 Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used by financing activities was 123.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash used of 159.0 million for the same period of 2023, a change of 36.0 million. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the net cash used primarily consists of repurchases of our 6.25 Senior Secured Notes of 92.2 million, payments on other long-term debt and short-term financing of 15.9 million and repurchases of 14.2 million of common stock. 
 For the first nine months of 2023, the net cash used primarily consists of repurchases of our 6.25 Senior Secured Notes of 114.3, payments on other long-term debt and short-term financing of 24.3 million and 20.4 million for the repurchases of common stock.

(2) Debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of approximately 0.8 million and 0.5 million, respectively, relating to our Revolving Credit Facility are not included in Unamortized debt issuance cost. They are included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in Intangible and other assets, net. 

We currently have a revolving credit facility pursuant to that credit agreement, dated December 21, 2023, between us and the lenders identified on the signature pages thereof and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, as administrative agent (the Revolving Credit Facility ), with a borrowing base up to an initial maximum of 75 million, with an option to increase the maximum by an additional 25 million (which amount is uncommitted). Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base and an availability block of 7.5 million which is applied against the 75 million initially reducing the maximum (which can be removed by us at our sole discretion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions). The Revolving Credit Facility provides for a sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed 10 million, with the outstanding amount of any such letters of credit reducing availability for borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, our Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and had approximately 34 million of availability. See Note 4 for further discussion on the facility. 
 For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 65 million to 85 million. This capital spending is primarily planned for reliability and maintenance capital projects. 
 From time to time, when the Company exceeds the funding threshold in our natural gas purchase commitments the Company is required to fund cash collateral to our counterparty. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 199.4 million of cash and short-term investments. From time to time, we may seek to deploy capital through common stock repurchases or the early redemption of outstanding debt. Such repurchases may be made in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 We believe that the combination of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, the availability on our Revolving Credit Facility and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months. 
 Compliance with Long - Term Debt Covenants 
 As discussed in Note 4, the Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that we meet a financial covenant. The Revolving Credit Facility does not include financial covenant requirements unless a defined covenant trigger event has occurred and is continuing. As of September 30, 2024, no trigger event had occurred. 
 Loan Agreements 
 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 LSB has 478.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.25 Senior Secured Notes outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Interest is to be paid semiannually in arrears on May 15 th and October 15 th , maturing October 15, 2028. 
 Secured Financing due 2025 We are a party to a 30 million secured financing arrangement with an affiliate of Eldridge. Principal and interest are payable in 60 equal monthly installments with a final balloon payment of approximately 5 million due in August 2025. 
 29 

Revolving Credit Facility At September 30, 2024, our Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and had approximately 34 million of availability, based on our eligible collateral, less outstanding letters of credit as of that date. Also see discussion above under Compliance with Long-Term Debt Covenants. 
 Finance leases Our finance leases consist primarily of leases on railcars. Most of our railcar leases are classified as operating leases. 
 Capital Expenditures First Nine Months of 2024 
 For the first nine months of 2024, capital expenditures relating to PP E were 64.1 million. The capital expenditures were funded primarily from cash and working capital. 
 See discussion above under Capitalization for our expected capital expenditures. 
 Equity and debt repurchases 
 In May 2023, our Board authorized a 150 million stock repurchase program. The program is intended as a means to maximize shareholder value by returning capital to shareholders. Under the repurchase program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Such purchases may be made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or other means as determined by our management and in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. The repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular number or type of securities. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock at an average cost of 8.13 per share for a total of approximately 12.1 million. Total repurchase authority remaining under the repurchase program was approximately 109 million as of September 30, 2024. The repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any of our Senior Secured Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 96.6 million in principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes for approximately 92.2 million. 
 Expenses Associated with Environmental Regulatory Compliance 
 We are subject to specific federal and state environmental compliance laws, regulations and guidelines. As a result, our expenses were 4.0 million for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with environmental projects. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to incur expenses ranging from 0.8 million to 1.1 million in connection with additional environmental projects. However, it is possible that the actual costs could be significantly different than our estimates. 
 Seasonality 
 We believe fertilizer products sold to the agricultural industry are seasonal, while sales into the industrial sectors generally are less susceptible to seasonal fluctuations. The selling seasons for fertilizer products are primarily during the spring and fall planting seasons, which typically extend from March through June and from September through November in the geographical markets where we distribute the majority of our fertilizer products. As a result, we typically increase our inventory of fertilizer products prior to the beginning of each planting season in order to meet the demand for our products. In addition, the amount and timing of sales to the agricultural markets depend upon weather conditions and other circumstances beyond our control. 
 Performance and Payment Bonds 
 We are contingently liable to sureties in respect of insurance bonds issued by the sureties in connection with certain contracts entered into by subsidiaries in the normal course of business. These insurance bonds primarily represent guarantees of future performance of our subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, we have agreed to indemnify the sureties for payments, up to 9.7 million, made by them in respect of such bonds. All of these insurance bonds are expected to expire or be renewed in 2024. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 1 for recently issued accounting standards. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. In addition, the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingencies and fair values, including, but not limited to, various environmental and legal matters, including matters discussed under footnote A of Note 5. 
 Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We establish valuation allowances if we believe it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of deferred tax assets will not be 
 30 

realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. 
 It is also reasonably possible that the estimates and assumptions utilized as of September 30, 2024, could change in the near term. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and judgments, as additional information becomes known. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 General 
 Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices of ammonia and natural gas and changes in market interest rates. 
 Forward Sales Commitments Risk 
 Periodically, we enter into forward firm sales commitments for products to be delivered in future periods. As a result, we could be exposed to embedded losses should our product costs exceed the firm sales prices at the end of a reporting period. At September 30, 2024, we had no embedded losses associated with sales commitments with firm sales prices. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Since we are exposed to commodity price risk, we periodically enter into contracts to purchase natural gas for anticipated production needs to manage risk related to changes in prices of natural gas commodities. Generally, these contracts are considered normal purchases because they provide for the purchase of natural gas that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business, and as such, are exempt from derivative accounting requirements. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding natural gas contracts which are subject to derivative accounting requirements. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We may be exposed to variable interest rate risk with respect to our Revolving Credit Facility when there are outstanding borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings on this credit facility and no other variable rate borrowings. We currently do not hedge our interest rate risk associated with our variable interest loan. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
