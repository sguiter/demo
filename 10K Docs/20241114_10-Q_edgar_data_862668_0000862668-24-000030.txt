, and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended , and 2023, have been included. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2024 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2024. Operating results for the three months ended are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending June 30, 2025.

 , the Company had incurred historical recurring losses from operations and incurred negative cash flows from operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent on its future profitability and on the on-going support of its shareholders, affiliates and creditors. In order to mitigate the going concern issues, the Company is actively pursuing business partnerships, managing its continuing operations, and implementing cost-cutting measures. The Company may not be successful in any of these efforts.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward Looking Statements 
 
 Certain statements contained in, or incorporated by reference in, this report are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, may, plan, possible, project, should, will, and similar words or expressions. The Company's forward-looking statements include certain information relating to general business strategy, growth strategies, financial results, liquidity, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, discontinued operations, research and development, product development, the introduction of new products, the potential markets and uses for the Company's products, the Company's ability to increase its sales campaign effectively, the Company's regulatory filings with the FDA, acquisitions, dispositions, the development of joint venture opportunities, intellectual property and patent protection and infringement, the loss of revenue due to the expiration or termination of certain agreements, the effect of competition on the structure of the markets in which the Company competes, increased legal, accounting and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs, information security, cybersecurity and data privacy risks, defending the Company in litigation matters and the Company's cost saving initiatives. The reader must carefully consider forward-looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by assumptions that fail to materialize as anticipated, including risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, the ability to continue as a going concern including the ability to raise capital, manage operations and pursue business partnerships and cost-cutting measures, and the other risks described in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may vary materially. It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors affecting the Company's forward-looking statements, and the reader therefore should not consider the list of such factors contained in its periodic report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 and this Form 10-Q quarterly report to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions. 

Executive Overview three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following highlights are discussed in further detail within this Form 10-Q. The reader is encouraged to read this Form 10-Q in its entirety to gain a more complete understanding of factors impacting Company performance and financial condition. 
 
 Consolidated net revenue decreased approximately 164,000 or 5.6 , to 2,781,000 during the three months ended , as compared to the same period of last fiscal year. The decrease in net revenue is mainly attributed to a decrease in sales of Sonomed's ultrasound products of 418,000 offset by an increase in sales of Trek's gas products of 257,000 during the three months ended . 
 
 Consolidated cost of goods sold totaled approximately 1,568,000, or 56.4 , of total revenue for the three months ended , as compared to 1,648,000, or 56.0 , of total revenue of the same period of last fiscal year. The increase of 0.4 in cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue is mainly due to changes in product sales mix and geographic differences, partially offset by a reduction in Digital labor costs during the three months ended . 
 
 Consolidated marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 1,000, or 0.1 , to 1,099,000 for the three months ended , as compared to the same period of last fiscal year. Decreases in Digital s consulting and network expenses, Corporate s salary and consulting expenses, and commission expenses were offset by a reversal of bad debt, along with increases in ultrasound salary and consulting expenses and corporate network expenses during the three months ended . 
 
 Consolidated research and development expenses decreased 71,000, or 33.5 , to 141,000 for the three months ended , as compared to the same period of last fiscal year. Research and development expenses were primarily expenses associated with the introduction of new or enhanced products. The decrease in research and 
 14 

development expenses is mainly due to decreased image management consulting expense during the three months ended .

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact amounts reported therein. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 For a description of the accounting policies that, in management s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could, if different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.

 Russia-Ukraine War 
 
 In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As military activity proceeds and sanctions, export controls and other measures are imposed by many countries against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine, the war is increasingly affecting the global economy and financial markets, as well as exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including rising inflation and global supply-chain disruption. 
 
 Israel-Hamas war 
 
 In October 2023, Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, and then Israel declared war and decimated the Gaza Strip. The Israel-Hamas war and conflicts could affect economic activity via lower trade with the Middle East, disruption of supply chain and collection of trade receivables in the region. 
 
 The Company has operations or activities in countries and regions outside the United States. As a result, its global operations are affected by economic, political, and other conditions in the foreign countries in which it does business as well as U.S. laws regulating international trade, although the Company has not yet assessed that these wars have had a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Our total cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 230,000 of cash on hand and restricted cash of approximately 256,000 compared to approximately 209,000 of cash on hand and restricted cash of 256,000 as of June 30, 2024 . 
 
 Because the Company's operations have not historically generated sufficient revenues to enable profitability, we will continue to monitor costs and expenses closely and may need to raise additional capital or take other actions to fund operations. 
 
 The Company expects to continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through capital raising sources if possible and available, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders, through revenues from the licensing of the Company's products, or through strategic alliances. Additionally, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt sec urities through one or more discrete transactions, or enter a strategic alliance arrangement, but can provide no assurances that any such financing or strategic alliance arrangement will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with a debt financing would result in increased fixed obligations and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 68.6 million, historically incurred recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, and our ability to generate cash to meet our cash requirements for the following twelve months as of the date of this form 10-Q. 
 
 The following table presents overall liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024. Table amounts are in thousands: 
 
 September 30, June 30, 2024 2024 Current Ratio: Current assets 4,448 4,397 Less: Current liabilities 2,681 2,669 Working capital 1,767 1,728 Current ratio 1.66 to 1 1.65 to 1 Debt to Total Capital Ratio: Note payable, lease liabilities, and EIDL loan 426 525 Total debt 426 525 Total equity 1,778 1,810 Total capital 2,204 2,334 Total debt to total capital 19.3 22.5 
 18 

Working Capital Position 
 Working capital increased approximately 39,000 as of , and the current ratio increased to 1.66 to 1 from 1.65 to 1 when compared to June 30, 2024 . 
 Debt to total capital ratio was 19.3 and 22.5 as of , and June 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease of debt to total capital ratio is mainly due to lease payments. 
 
 Cash Flow Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 None. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (A) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Company's financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. 
 
 Based on their evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of , the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Company have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We identified a material weakness in internal control related to the proper design and implementation of controls over our estimates relating to the valuation of inventory and allowance for doubtful accounts, specifically over the precision of management s review during the year end June 30, 2024. 

(B) Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 19 

There have been changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act), during the first quarter ended that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. These include continuously standardizing the process for updating standard costs, enhancing data quality control through enhanced segregation of duties in both the updating and review stages and improving the accuracy of data in an Excel spreadsheet with multiple links and formulas. These changes were designed to strengthen the accuracy and reliability of the inventory valuation process.
