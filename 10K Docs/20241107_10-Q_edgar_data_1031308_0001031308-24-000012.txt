The United States U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC allows us to incorporate by reference information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
 Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, we refer to Bentley Systems, Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, as Bentley Systems, Bentley, the Company, we, us, and our. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q contains trademarks, service marks, brands, or product names owned by us, as well as those owned by others. 
 Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. 
 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q includes forward looking statements. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy, and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward looking statements. The words believe, may, will, could, would, seeks, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, and similar expressions, as well as statements regarding our focus for the future, are intended to identify forward looking statements. We have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations, projections, and assumptions about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short term and long term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward looking statements. The forward looking statements, as well as our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q as a whole, are subject to risks and uncertainties. 
 These statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by the forward looking statements. We discuss many of these risks in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q in greater detail in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. You should not rely upon forward looking statements as predictions of future events. 
 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements, events, or circumstances reflected in the forward looking statements will occur. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.

 Cost of subscriptions and licenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, cost of subscriptions and licenses increased primarily due to an increase in cloud related costs of 3,360, partially offset by lower amortization of capitalized costs under our Accelerated Commercial Development Program ACDP as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, cost of subscriptions and licenses increased primarily due to an increase in cloud related costs of 6,723. Partially offsetting this increase was lower amortization of capitalized costs under our ACDP of 1,833 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, headcount related costs decreased 1,007 due to lower stock based compensation expense, partially offset by realignment expenses recognized in 2024 related to the 2023 Program. 
 Cost of services. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, cost of services decreased primarily due to a decrease in headcount related costs of 2,270 and 11,704, respectively, mainly due to a reduction in third party personnel costs.

 Research and development. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of 4,137 mainly due to an increase in annual and other compensation costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs, mainly due to an increase in annual and other compensation costs, an increase in third party personnel costs, and an increase in travel, partially offset by lower acquisition related retention incentives and lower separation costs. 
 37 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development headcount related costs reflect run rate savings associated with the strategic realignment program, which we initiated during the fourth quarter of 2023. While most of the realignment actions were completed at the beginning of 2024, our reinvestment of these run rate savings into priority investment areas, such as artificial intelligence in product development, was fully realized during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Selling and marketing. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, selling and marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of 10,050 and 16,418, respectively, mainly due to an increase in annual and other compensation costs, and an increase in third party personnel costs primarily related to our marketing activities. 
 General and administrative . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of 2,770, mainly due to an increase in annual and other compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. The decrease in stock based compensation expense primarily related to the reduction in Gregory S. Bentley s fractional interest under the Bonus Plan as part of Mr. Bentley s transition to the role of Executive Chair of the Board of Directors effective July 1, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses further increased due to higher charitable contributions focusing on education and sustainability of 2,599. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized approximately 2,700 of costs associated with our internal use system implementations. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of 9,565, mainly due to an increase in annual and other compensation costs, and to a lesser extent, an increase in stock based compensation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses further increased due to higher expense associated with non income related taxes of 4,152, and higher charitable contributions focusing on education and sustainability of 2,524. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized approximately 6,200 of costs associated with our internal use system implementations, as well as approximately 2,200 of other corporate initiatives expenses. Partially offsetting these increases were lower acquisition costs of 4,593. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income of 1,797 due to the continued wind down of our Russian entities since we exited operations beginning in the second quarter of 2022. 
 Deferred compensation plan . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, deferred compensation plan expense (income) was attributable to the marked to market impact on deferred compensation plan liability balances period over period. 
 Amortization of purchased intangibles. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, on a constant currency basis, amortization of purchased intangibles decreased primarily due to previously acquired intangible assets that continue to become fully amortized and lower acquisition activity as compared to prior periods.

Key Business Metrics: 
 In addition to our results of operations discussed above, we believe the following presentation of key business metrics provides additional useful information to investors regarding our results of operations. To the extent material, we disclose below the additional purposes, if any, for which our management uses these key business metrics. Our key business metrics may vary significantly from period to period for reasons unrelated to our operating performance and may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 September 30, 2024 2023 ARR 1,270,726 1,124,774 Last twelve-months recurring revenues 1,195,118 1,076,434 Twelve-months ended constant currency (1) :

 (1) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency. 
 Recurring Revenues 
 Recurring revenues are the basis for our other revenue-related key business metrics. We believe this measure is useful in evaluating our ability to consistently retain and grow our revenues within our existing accounts. 
 Recurring revenues are subscriptions revenues that recur monthly, quarterly, or annually with specific or automatic renewal clauses and professional services revenues in which the underlying contract is based on a fixed fee and contains automatic annual renewal provisions. 
 ARR 
 ARR is a key business metric that we believe is useful in evaluating the scale and growth of our business as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our business. Furthermore, we believe ARR, considered in connection with our last twelve month recurring revenues dollar based net retention rate, is a leading indicator of revenue growth. 
 ARR is defined as the sum of the annualized value of our portfolio of contracts that produce recurring revenues as of the last day of the reporting period, and the annualized value of the last three months of recognized revenues for our contractually recurring consumption based software subscriptions with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, calculated using the spot foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that the last three months of recognized revenues, on an annualized basis, for our recurring software subscriptions with consumption measurement period durations of less than one year is a reasonable estimate of the annual revenues, given our consistently high retention rate and stability of usage under such subscriptions. 
 ARR resulting from the annualization of recurring contracts with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, as a percentage of total ARR, was 49 and 46 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with our E365 subscription offering representing 43 and 39 of total ARR as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Constant currency ARR growth rate is the growth rate of ARR measured on a constant currency basis. In reporting period over period ARR growth rates in constant currency, we calculate constant currency growth rates by translating current and prior period ARR on a transactional basis to our reporting currency using current year budget exchange rates. We believe that ARR growth is an important metric indicating the scale and growth of our business. 
 40 

Last Twelve Months Recurring Revenues 
 Last twelve month recurring revenues is a key business metric that we believe is useful in evaluating our ability to consistently retain and grow our recurring revenues. We believe that we will continue to experience favorable growth in recurring revenues primarily due to our strong account retention and recurring revenues dollar based net retention rates, as well as the addition of new accounts with recurring revenues. 
 Last twelve months recurring revenues is calculated as recurring revenues recognized over the preceding twelve month period. 
 The last twelve months recurring revenues for the periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the last twelve months of the comparative twelve month period increased by 118,684. This increase was primarily due to growth in ARR, which is primarily the result of growing our recurring revenues within our existing accounts as expressed in our recurring revenues dollar based net retention rate, as well as additional recurring revenues resulting from new accounts and acquisitions. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 91 and 89 , respectively, of our revenues were recurring revenues. 
 Account Retention Rate 
 Account retention rate is a key business metric that we believe is useful in evaluating the long term value of our account relationships and our ability to retain our account base. We believe that our consistent and high account retention rates illustrate our ability to retain and cultivate long term relationships with our accounts. 
 Account retention rate for any given twelve-month period is calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the prior period, as follows: the prior period recurring revenues from all accounts with recurring revenues in the current and prior period, divided by total recurring revenues from all accounts during the prior period. 
 Recurring Revenues Dollar Based Net Retention Rate 
 Recurring revenues dollar based net retention rate is a key business metric that we believe is useful in evaluating our ability to consistently retain and grow our recurring revenues. 
 Recurring revenues dollar based net retention rate is calculated, using the average exchange rates for the prior period, as follows: the recurring revenues for the current period, including any growth or reductions from existing accounts, but excluding recurring revenues from any new accounts added during the current period, divided by the total recurring revenues from all accounts during the prior period. A period is defined as any trailing twelve months. Related to our platform acquisitions, recurring revenues into new accounts will be captured as existing accounts starting with the second anniversary of the acquisition when such data conforms to the calculation methodology. This may cause variability in the comparison. 
 Given that recurring revenues represented 91 and 89 of our total revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, this metric helps explain our revenue performance as primarily growth from existing accounts. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP discussed above, we believe the following presentation of financial measures not in accordance with GAAP provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations. To the extent material, we disclose below the additional purposes, if any, for which our management uses these non GAAP financial measures and provide reconciliations between these non GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, including operating income, or other measures of performance. Our non GAAP financial measures may vary significantly from period to period for reasons unrelated to our operating performance and may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 41 

Adjusted OI w/SBC 
 Adjusted OI w/SBC is a non-GAAP financial measure and is used to measure the operational strength and performance of our business, as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our business. 
 Adjusted OI w/SBC is our primary performance measure, which excludes certain expenses and charges, including the non-cash amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of intangible assets, as we believe these may not be indicative of our core business operating results. We intentionally include stock-based compensation expense in this measure as we believe it better captures the economic costs of our business. 
 Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, to evaluate financial performance, and in our comparison of our financial results to those of other companies. It is also a significant performance measure in certain of our executive incentive compensation programs. 
 Adjusted OI w/SBC is defined as operating income adjusted for the following: amortization of purchased intangibles, expense (income) relating to deferred compensation plan liabilities, acquisition expenses, and realignment expenses (income), for the respective periods. 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors in making comparisons to other companies, although this measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 
 Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income adjusted for the following: amortization of purchased intangibles, expense (income) relating to deferred compensation plan liabilities, acquisition expenses, realignment expenses (income), and stock based compensation expense, for the respective periods.

 Further explanation of certain of our adjustments in arriving at Adjusted OI w/SBC and Adjusted operating income are as follows: 
 (1) Amortization of purchased intangibles . Amortization of purchased intangibles varies in amount and frequency and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Management finds it useful to exclude these non cash charges from our operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. The use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will also contribute to our revenues in future periods. Amortization of purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods. 
 42 

(2) Deferred compensation plan . We exclude Deferred compensation plan expense (income) when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because it is not reflective of our ongoing business and results of operation. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of this item on our total operating expenses. Deferred compensation plan liabilities are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the liabilities recorded as an expense (income) to Deferred compensation plan in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 (3) Acquisition expenses . We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of general and administrative expense (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q). Also included in our acquisition expenses are retention incentives paid to executives of the acquired companies. We exclude these acquisition expenses when we evaluate our continuing operational performance as we would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. 
 
 (4) Realignment expenses (income) . We exclude these charges and subsequent adjustments to our estimates when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because they are not reflective of our ongoing business and results of operations. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Realignment expenses were primarily associated with the 2023 Program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Realignment expenses (income) was associated with the continued wind down of our Russian entities since we exited operations beginning in the second quarter of 2022. 
 (5) Stock based compensation expense . We exclude non-cash stock based compensation expenses from certain of our non GAAP measures because we believe this is useful to investors in making comparisons to other companies. 
 
 Constant Currency 
 Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A significant amount of our operations is conducted in foreign currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. 
 In reporting period over period results, except for ARR as discussed above in Key Business Metrics section, we calculate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and constant currency information by translating current and prior period results on a transactional basis to our reporting currency using prior period average foreign currency exchange rates in which the transactions occurred.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources: 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents held domestically 5,593 3,693 Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries 66,582 64,719 Total cash and cash equivalents 72,175 68,412 
 Our primary source of operating cash is from the sale of our subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and services. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist mainly of headcount related costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to service our debt obligations, to pay quarterly dividends, to repurchase our Class B common stock and convertible debt, and for capital expenditures in support of our operations. We also use cash to fund our acquisitions of software assets and businesses, and other investment activities. 
 We believe that cash generated from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and external borrowings including available liquidity under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure that we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed and to fund our operations and growth investments with cash that has not been permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Our future capital requirements may be materially different than those currently planned in our budgeting and forecasting activities and depend on many factors, including our strategy of regularly acquiring and integrating specialized infrastructure engineering software businesses, our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our 
 45 

products, competitive factors, our discretionary payments of dividends or repurchases of our Class B common stock and convertible debt, funding of our purchase commitments, currency fluctuations, and overall economic conditions, globally. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders, while the incurrence of additional debt financing, including convertible debt, would result in additional debt service obligations. Such debt instruments also could introduce new or modified covenants that might restrict our operations and/or our ability to pay dividends, consummate acquisitions, or otherwise pursue our business strategies. We cannot provide assurance that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. 
 Cash Flows Activity 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 353,660 329,643 Investing activities (135,680) (51,245) Financing activities (213,218) (280,019) 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, net cash provided by operating activities was higher by 24,017 due to an increase in net income of 37,492 and a net increase in non cash adjustments of 30,200, partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities of 43,675. The decrease in cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the timing of collections on our receivables and a decrease in deferred revenues. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was higher by 84,435 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher acquisition related payments of 105,664, partially offset by lower purchases of investments of 10,545 and lower purchases of property and equipment and investment in capitalized software of 10,407. We used available cash and borrowings under our Credit Facility to fund an acquisition in September 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was lower by 66,801 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower net paydowns of the Credit Facility of 81,575, partially offset by higher dividend payments of 9,993, primarily due to an increase in our quarterly dividend per share to 0.06 in 2024 from 0.05 in 2023.

Long-Term Debt 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current portion of long-term debt 10,000 Long-term debt 1,418,870 1,518,403 Total debt 1,418,870 1,528,403 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 732,149 available under the Credit Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made repayments of 140,000 on the senior secured term loan under the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the senior secured term loan, repayments are applied to unpaid quarterly principal installments. There are no remaining required principal installments on the senior secured term loan through the maturity date of November 15, 2025. 
 We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility, the 2026 Notes, and the 2027 Notes as of September 30, 2024. Any failure to comply with such covenants under the Credit Facility would prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the Credit Facility, and, as with any failure to comply with such covenants under the 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes, could constitute a default that may cause all amounts outstanding to become due and immediately payable in full. 
 On October 18, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Credit Facility, which provides us with a 1,300,000 revolving credit facility, including 125,000 in swingline loans and 125,000 in letters of credit. The 2024 Credit Facility also provides us with a 500,000 accordion feature to increase the facility in the form of both revolving indebtedness and/or incremental term loans. On October 18, 2024, we used borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility to repay all indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility, including the outstanding senior secured term loan. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 BSY Stock Repurchase Program 
 Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 200,000 of our Class B common stock and/or outstanding convertible senior notes through June 30, 2024 under the Repurchase Program. This authorization under the Repurchase Program expired on June 30, 2024. In March 2024, our Board of Directors approved an extension to the Repurchase Program authorizing us to repurchase up to 200,000 of our Class B common stock and/or outstanding convertible senior notes from June 30, 2024 through June 30, 2026. We may use available working capital, cash provided by operating activities, and/or external borrowings including available liquidity under our Credit Facility to make repurchases. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 912,737 shares for 45,769 under the Repurchase Program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not repurchase shares under the Repurchase Program. 
 The timing, as well as the number and value of shares and/or outstanding convertible senior notes repurchased under the Repurchase Program, will be determined at our discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including our assessment of the intrinsic value of our shares, the market price of our Class B common stock and outstanding convertible senior notes, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with our debt and other agreements, and applicable legal requirements. 
 47 

Withholding Taxes on Certain Equity Awards 
 We have the right to require that certain equity awardees receive gross or net quantities of shares of our Class B common stock, including distributions from the DCP and share issuances under our Bonus Plan. In the case of a gross issuance or distribution, an awardee is required to reimburse promptly to us the cash required for his or her tax withholding amounts. Conversely, under a net issuance or distribution, shares are withheld in consideration of remitting withholding taxes on behalf of an equity awardee, thereby requiring us to remit cash for the tax withholdings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we exercised our right to require that impacted equity awardees receive gross quantities of our Class B common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we allowed impacted awardees the option to receive net quantities of shares of our Class B common stock. We will continue to evaluate whether share awards will be required to be received by awardees on a gross basis, or if net settlement may be elected by awardees. 
 Dividend Payments 
 The declaration and payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors. We paid quarterly dividends of 0.06 per share of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.05 per share of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While we intend to continue paying quarterly dividends, any future determination will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on a number of factors, including our results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions under Delaware law, and overall financial condition, as well as any other factors our Board of Directors considers relevant. In addition, the terms of the agreement governing the Credit Facility limit the amount of dividends we can pay.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk exposure as described in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 We evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Bentley Systems, Incorporated have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a or 15d of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 49 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject from time to time to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of pending matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently believe that we do not have any material litigation pending against us. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K.
