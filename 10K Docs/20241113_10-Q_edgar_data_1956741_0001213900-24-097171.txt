shares of class B common stock at a price to the public of per share for gross offering proceeds of
 5,000,0000 , before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses payable by the Company. After deducting underwriting
discounts, commissions and other offering costs, the Company received net proceeds of . 

Liquidity 

The Company has incurred losses and negative
cash flows from operations. From October 17, 2022 (the date of the acquisition) through September 30, 2024, the Company has financed
its operations primarily through investor funding. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of , a net loss of
 , and cash used in operating activities of . In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , management is required to perform a
two-step analysis over the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management must first evaluate whether there are
conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of
12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. If management concludes that substantial doubt is raised, management is
also required to consider whether its plans alleviate that doubt. 

Despite the initial public offering described
above, management believes that currently available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company s planned expenditures
over the next 12 months. These factors, individually and collectively indicate that a material uncertainty exists that raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. 

The Company will be dependent upon the raising
of additional capital through equity and/or debt financing in order to implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue in
excess of costs. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity,
stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders
of common stock. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations,
through debt covenants or other restrictions. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing ventures,
and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis under which the Company is expected to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in
the normal course of business.

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As a result,
we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth
company, we will not be required to: 

have
 an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b)
 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
 regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing
 additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion
 and analysis); 

submit
 certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay 
 and say-on-frequency; and 

disclose
 certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation
 and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median
 employee compensation. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In
other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our
initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are 1.235 billion or more,
(iii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our class B common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds
 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued
more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

Revenue .
We generate revenue from sales of our cleaning products. Our revenue increased by 39,216, or 12.04 , to 364,900 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 from 325,684 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increased number
of customers. 

Cost
of sales . Our cost of sales consists of raw materials, components and labor. Our cost of sales increased by 26,826, or 17.58 ,
to 179,401 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 152,575 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage
of revenue, cost of sales increased from 46.85 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 49.16 for the three months ended September
30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and increase in demo expenses due to a change in sales strategy of
providing customers considering large orders demonstration equipment at no cost. 

Gross
profit . As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased by 12,390, or 7.16 , to 185,499 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 from 173,109 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased from
53.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 50.84 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

General
and administrative expenses . Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including
employee salaries and bonuses plus related payroll taxes, stock based compensation expense, professional advisor fees, bad debts, rent
expense, insurance and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations. Our general and administrative expenses increased
by 406,338, or 79.69 , to 916,214 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 509,876 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our general and administrative expenses increased from 156.25 for the three months ended September
30, 2023 to 251.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to 118,440 stock related compensation
expense, 106,720 external accounting fees, 74,600 in consulting fees and 69,200 increase in director and officer insurance. 

Advertising
expenses . Our advertising expenses consist of vendor trade shows and various trade publications. Our advertising
expenses increased by 45,387, or 5,514.82 , to 46,210 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 823 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of revenue, our advertising expenses increased from 0.25 for the three months ended September
30, 2023 to 12.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Such increase was primarily due to a significant increase in our public
relations activities. 

Depreciation
and amortization expense . We incurred depreciation and amortization expense of 39,823, or 10.91 of revenue, for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 38,562, or 11.84 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
expense, net . We incurred interest expense, net, of 39,334, or 10.78 of revenue, for the three months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 61,142, or 18.77 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due
to interest expense for the 2024 period being offset by interest income of 17,153 from an interest bearing money market account opened
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 

Net
loss . As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had a net loss of 856,082 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 437,294 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase in loss of
 418,788, or 95.77 . 

19 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our company has incurred losses and negative
cash flows from operations. From October 17, 2022 (the date of the acquisition) through September 30, 2024, we have financed our
operations primarily through private investor funding and an initial public offering. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents of 1,210,382, a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 856,082 and cash used in operating
activities of 799,764. 

Despite our initial public offering, management believes that currently available resources will not be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures over
the next 12 months. These factors, individually and collectively indicate that a material uncertainty exists that raises substantial
doubt about our company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date of issuance of the accompanying
financial statements. 

We will be dependent upon the raising of additional
capital through equity and/or debt financing in order to implement our business plan and generate sufficient revenue in excess of costs.
If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience
dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock. If we raise
additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. There
is no assurance that we will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition. Thes accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications
of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis under which our company is expected to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in
the normal course of business. 

Summary of Cash Flow 

The following table provides detailed information
about our net cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Net cash used in operating activities was 799,764
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 308,335 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months
ended September 30, 2024, our net loss of 856,082 and a decrease in prepaid expenses of 142,084, offset by an increase in non-cash
stock based compensation expense of 182,400, were the primary drivers of net cash used in operating activities. For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, our net loss of 437,294, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 144,224,
a decrease in inventory of 77,026, and a decrease in accounts receivable of 66,233, offset by a non-cash interest expense of 208,248,
an increase in prepaid expenses of 93,550 and stock based compensation of 63,960, were the primary drivers of the net cash used in
operating activities. 

20 

Net cash used in investing activities was 6,465
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,015 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used
in investing activities for both periods consisted entirely of purchases of property and equipment. 

Net cash used in financing activities was 0
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 19,726 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in
financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of payments
for deferred offering costs of 13,523 and repayment of related party loans of 6,203 . 

Debt 

Please see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed
financial statements above for a description of the terms of our outstanding debt. 

Contractual Obligations 

Our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations
under the loans described in Note 9 to our unaudited condensed financial statements above. We also have a non-cancellable operating lease
commitment for our office facility expiring in 2028 as described in Note 13 to the unaudited condensed financial statements above. Other
than the foregoing, at September 30, 2024, we did not have other long-term debt obligations, capital (finance) lease obligations, operating
lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities reflected on our statements of financial position. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our unaudited condensed financial
statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates. These estimates
are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

For a description of the accounting policies
that, in management s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could,
if different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows,
see Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting
Policies in the Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, 
as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure information required to
be disclosed in our reports that we file or furnish pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer
(our principal financial officer), as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the
participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance
level due to material weaknesses identified related to (1) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the expertise
to design, implement, and execute a formal risk assessment process and formal accounting policies, procedures, and controls over accounting
and financial reporting to ensure the timely and accurate recording of financial transactions while maintaining a segregation of duties;
and (2) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the appropriate technical expertise with United States generally
accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, to identify, evaluate, and account for complex transactions, including identification of
related party transactions, and review valuation reports prepared by external specialists. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

In preparing our financial statements as of and
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
The material weaknesses we identified related to (1) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the expertise to design,
implement, and execute a formal risk assessment process and formal accounting policies, procedures, and controls over accounting and
financial reporting to ensure the timely and accurate recording of financial transactions while maintaining a segregation of duties;
and (2) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the appropriate U.S. GAAP technical expertise to identify, evaluate,
and account for complex transactions and review valuation reports prepared by external specialists. 

As disclosed in the Form 10-K, our management
has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses, and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we continued to
implement the following remedial procedures. We are planning on implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial
reporting to remediate these material weaknesses, including formalizing our processes and internal control documentation and strengthening
supervisory reviews by our financial management and hiring additional qualified accounting and finance personnel and engaging financial
consultants to enable the implementation of internal control over financial reporting and segregating duties amongst accounting and finance
personnel. 

While we are implementing these measures, we
cannot assure you that these efforts will remediate our material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in a timely manner, or at all,
or prevent restatements of our financial statements in the future. If we are unable to successfully remediate our material weaknesses,
or identify any future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely
affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports, and the
market price of our common stock may decline as a result. 

In accordance with the provisions of the JOBS
Act, we and our independent registered public accounting firm were not required to, and did not, perform an evaluation of our internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we
will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may still exist when we report on the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of
Controls 

Our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system
of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II 

OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may become involved in
various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as set forth below, we
are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or operating results. 

On August 20, 2024, Matthew Atkinson, our
former Chief Executive Officer and a significant stockholder, filed a complaint against our company in the District Court of Douglas
County, Nebraska. In his complaint, he alleges that we failed to pay him compensation in the amount of 123,625.76, unreimbursed
expenses in the amount of 1,815.25, and accrued and unpaid vacation in the amount of 6,153.84, or 131,594.85 in the aggregate. He
alleges that we are obligated to pay him these amounts under an executive employment agreement between him and our company, and that
he had become entitled to these amounts before he resigned his employment in February 2024. Based on these allegations, Mr. Atkinson
asserts in his complaint causes of action for violation of the Nebraska Wage Payment and Collection Act, or the Act, breach of
contract, and promissory estoppel. His complaints asks for a judgment that: (a) awards him damages in amount to be proved at trial
but no less than 131,594.85, (b) assesses a penalty against our company pursuant to the Act in the amount of 263,189.70, and (c)
awards Mr. Atkinson an amount for his reasonable costs and attorney s fees incurred in litigating this matter and pre- and
post-judgment interest.
