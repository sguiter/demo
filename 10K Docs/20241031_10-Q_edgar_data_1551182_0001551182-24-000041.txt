 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (revenue recognized exceeds amount billed to the customer), and deferred revenue (advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized). Accounts receivable from customers were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Unbilled receivables were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in unbilled receivables reflects higher revenue recognized and not yet billed from increased business activity in 2024.

 compared to expense of for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was due to the reduction of a valuation allowance on a foreign tax attribute, partially offset by greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was expense of compared to expense of for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2024 was due to a larger impact from the excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based payments and the reduction of valuation allowances on foreign tax attributes, partially offset by greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions. 
 Brazil Tax Years 2005-2012 
 The Company has Brazilian tax cases primarily relating to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of third-party businesses and corporate reorganizations. One case involves tax years 2005-2008 (Case 1), and the other involves tax years 2009-2012 (Case 2). Case 2 is proceeding on a more accelerated timeline than Case 1. For Case 2, the Company received a tax assessment in 2014 that included interest and penalties. In November 2019, the Company received an unfavorable result at the final tax administrative appeals level, resulting in an alleged tax deficiency of million plus million of interest and penalties (translated at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate). The Company is challenging this assessment in the judicial system and, on April 18, 2022, received an unfavorable decision at the first judicial level. On April 27, 2022, the Company filed a motion for clarification relating to that decision. On May 20, 2022, the court largely upheld its prior decision without further clarification. On June 9, 2022, the Company filed its notice of appeal to the second level court. On July 11, 2024, the court published a favorable decision resulting in the cancellation of an additional penalty imposed by the tax authorities. As a result of the favorable decision, the alleged interest and penalties was reduced from million to million (translated at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate). The Company intends to continue its challenge of the assessment in the judicial system. 
 As previously disclosed for Case 1, the Company received a separate tax assessment alleging a tax deficiency of million plus million of interest and penalties (translated at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate), which the Company is challenging in the judicial system. On April 4, 2024, the court published a favorable decision resulting in a reduction to the Case 1 assessment for the goodwill generated from the acquisition of a third-party business. In the same decision, the court confirmed the cancellation of an additional penalty imposed by the tax authorities. As a result of the favorable decision, the alleged tax deficiency was reduced to million plus million of interest and penalties (translated at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate). The remainder of Case 1 is still pending resolution at the first judicial level. 
 Both cases are expected to take several years to resolve through the Brazilian judicial system and require provision of certain assets as security for the alleged deficiencies. As of September 30, 2024, the Company pledged Brazilian real estate assets with net book value of million and provided additional security in the form of bank secured bonds and insurance bonds totaling million and a cash deposit of million (translated at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate). 
 The Company believes that the final resolution of both of the assessments will not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty given the complex nature of tax controversies. Should the ultimate outcome of these matters deviate from our reasonable expectations, they may have a material adverse impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. However, Eaton believes that its interpretations of tax laws and application of tax laws to its facts are correct.

 Eaton values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. 
 On March 22, 2021, Eaton acquired Green Motion SA, a leading designer and manufacturer of electric vehicle charging hardware and related software based in Switzerland. Green Motion SA was acquired for million, including million of cash paid at closing and an initial estimate of million for the fair value of contingent future consideration based on 2023 and 2024 revenue performance. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is estimated by discounting contingent payments expected to be made, and may increase or decrease based on changes in revenue estimates and discount rates, with a maximum possible undiscounted value of million. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent future payments has been reduced to million based primarily on lower revenue in 2023 and lower projected 2024 revenue compared to the initial estimates at closing. This reduction is presented in Other income - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following discussion of Consolidated Financial Results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Consolidated Financial Results table below. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they provide additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our business performance and trends, and they allow investors to more easily compare Eaton s financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton. 
 Acquisition and Divestiture Charges 
 Eaton incurs integration charges and transaction costs to acquire and integrate businesses, and transaction, separation and other costs to divest and exit businesses. Eaton also recognizes gains and losses on the sale of businesses. A summary of these Corporate items is as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 (In millions except for per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Acquisition integration, divestiture charges and transaction costs (income) (4) 18 23 69 Income tax benefit 4 7 14 Total charges (income) after income taxes (4) 14 17 54 Per ordinary share - diluted (0.01) 0.03 0.04 0.14 
 Acquisition integration, divestiture charges and transaction costs (income) in 2024 and 2023 are primarily related to acquisitions completed prior to 2023, including other charges and income to acquire and exit businesses. 2024 also included the reduction in fair value of contingent future consideration from the Green Motion SA acquisition. These charges were included in Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, Research and development expense, or Other income - net. In Business Segment Information in Note 16, the charges were included in Other expense - net. 
 Restructuring Programs 
 In the second quarter of 2020, Eaton initiated a multi-year restructuring program to reduce its cost structure and gain efficiencies in its business segments and at corporate in order to initially respond to declining market conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the inception of the program, the Company incurred expenses of 199 million for workforce reductions and 184 million for plant closing and other costs, resulting in total charges of 382 million through December 31, 2023. This restructuring program was substantially complete at the end of 2023 and mature year benefits from the program are estimated to be 265 million and will be largely realized by the end of 2024. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, Eaton implemented a new multi-year restructuring program to accelerate opportunities to optimize its operations and global support structure. These actions will better align the Company's functions to support anticipated growth and drive greater effectiveness throughout the Company. Restructuring charges incurred under this program were 54 million in the third quarter and 132 million in the first nine months of 2024. This restructuring program is expected to be completed in 2026 and is expected to incur additional expenses related to workforce reductions of 198 million and plant closing and other costs of 45 million, resulting in total estimated charges of 375 million for the entire program. The Company expects mature year benefits of 325 million when the multi-year program is fully implemented. 
 Additional information related to these restructuring programs is presented in Note 15.

 Organic sales increased 8 in the third quarter of 2024 due to strength in commercial institutional end-markets in the Electrical Americas business segment, strength in data center and utility end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, and strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket, and military aftermarket in the Aerospace business segment, partially offset by weakness in industrial end-markets in the Electrical Americas business segment, weakness in the residential end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, and weakness in the North American region in the Vehicle business segment.

Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, certain facilities in the Electrical Americas business segment were impacted by Hurricane Helene, and the Aerospace business segment was impacted by industry related labor strikes. These events had a negative impact on Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 of 46 million. We expect Hurricane Helene and the labor strikes could continue to have an impact on Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Organic sales increased 8 in the first nine months of 2024 due to strength in commercial institutional end-markets in the Electrical Americas business segment, strength in utility end-markets in the Electrical Global business segment, strength in data center end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket, and military OEM in the Aerospace business segment, and strength in the European region in the eMobility business segment, partially offset by weakness in residential end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments and weakness in the North American region in the Vehicle business segment. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit margin increased from 37.3 in the third quarter of 2023 to 38.6 in the third quarter of 2024. Material factors affecting this increase were a 270 basis point increase from higher sales and a 160 basis point increase from operating efficiencies, partially offset by a 120 basis point decline from higher commodity and wage inflation and a 110 basis point decline from higher costs to support growth initiatives. 
 Gross profit margin increased from 36.0 in the first nine months of 2023 to 38.0 in the first nine months of 2024.

 Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was expense of 16.1 compared to expense of 17.3 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was due to the reduction of a valuation allowance on a foreign tax attribute, partially offset by greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was expense of 16.8 compared to expense of 16.9 for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2024 was due to a larger impact from the excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based payments and the reduction of valuation allowances on foreign tax attributes, partially offset by greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions.

The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2024. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On February 27, 2019, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program for share repurchases up to 5.0 billion of ordinary shares (2019 Program). On February 23, 2022, the Board renewed the 2019 Program by providing authority for up to 5.0 billion in repurchases to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2022 Program). Under the 2022 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 3.0 million and 5.3 million ordinary shares, respectively, were repurchased under the 2022 program in the open market at a total cost of 891 million and 1,629 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, no ordinary shares were repurchased. The Company will continue to pursue share repurchases in 2024 depending on market conditions and capital levels. 
 Acquisition of Businesses 
 The Company paid cash of 50 million to acquire a business in the first nine months of 2024. There were no business acquisitions in the first nine months of 2023. The Company paid cash of 68 million for investments in associate companies in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The Company will continue to focus on deploying its capital toward businesses that provide opportunities for higher growth and strong returns, and align with secular trends and its power management strategies. 
 Debt 
 The Company manages a number of short-term and long-term debt instruments, including commercial paper. At September 30, 2024, the Company had Short-term debt of 3 million, Current portion of long-term debt of 714 million, and Long-term debt of 8,678 million. The Company believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, and access to capital markets to meet scheduled payments of long-term debt. 
 Supply Chain Finance Program 
 A third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company s suppliers, at the supplier s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. The SCF program does not have a significant impact on the Company s liquidity as payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. For additional information on the SCF program, see Note 7.

Guaranteed Debt 
 Issuers, Guarantors and Guarantor Structure 
 Eaton Corporation has issued senior notes pursuant to indentures dated April 1, 1994 (the 1994 Indenture), November 20, 2012 (the 2012 Indenture), September 15, 2017 (the 2017 Indenture) and August 23, 2022 (as supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures of the same date and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2023, the 2022 Indenture). The senior notes of Eaton Corporation are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Registered Senior Notes). Eaton Capital Unlimited Company, a subsidiary of Eaton, is the issuer of five outstanding series of debt securities sold in offshore transactions under Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act (the Eurobonds). The Eurobonds and the Registered Senior Notes (together, the Senior Notes) comprise substantially all of Eaton s long-term indebtedness. 
 Substantially all of the Senior Notes (with limited exceptions), together with the credit facilities described above under Liquidity and Financial Condition (the Credit Facilities), are guaranteed by Eaton and 17 of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, they rank equally with each other. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Eaton and its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, Eaton has no material, long-term secured debt. The guaranteed Registered Senior Notes are also structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Eaton's subsidiaries that are not guarantors. Except as described below under Future Guarantors, Eaton is not obligated to cause its subsidiaries to guarantee the Registered Senior Notes. 
 The table set forth in Exhibit 22 filed with the Form 10-K filed on February 23, 2023 (10-K Exhibit 22) details the primary obligors and guarantors with respect to the guaranteed Registered Senior Notes. 
 Terms of Guarantees of Registered Securities 
 Payment of principal and interest on the Registered Senior Notes is guaranteed, on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis by the subsidiaries of Eaton set forth in the table referenced in the 10-K Exhibit 22. Each guarantee is full and unconditional, and joint and several. Each guarantor s guarantee is an unsecured obligation that ranks equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes are subject to a customary savings clause or similar provision designed to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise legally impermissible or voidable obligation. 
 Though the terms of the indentures vary slightly, generally, each guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes by a guarantor that is a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation provides that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: 
 (a) the consummation of certain types of transactions permitted under the applicable indenture, including one that results in such guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; and 
 (b) for Registered Senior Notes issued under the 2022 Indenture, when such guarantor is a guarantor or issuer of indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of less than 25 of our total outstanding indebtedness. 
 Further, each guarantee by a direct or indirect parent of Eaton Corporation (other than Eaton) provides that it will also be released if: 
 (c) such guarantee (so long as the guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligations), becomes prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation or by any contractual obligation; or 
 (d) such guarantee results in material adverse tax consequences to Eaton or any of its subsidiaries (so long as the applicable guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligation). 
 The guarantee of Eaton does not contain any release provisions. 
 Future Guarantors 
 The 2012 and 2017 Indentures generally provide that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under any series of debt securities or a syndicated credit facility. Further, the 2012 and 2017 Indentures provide that any entity that becomes a direct or indirect parent entity of Eaton Corporation and holds any material assets, with certain limited exceptions, or owes any material liabilities must become a guarantor. The 2022 Indenture provides only that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of 25 of the Parent and its Subsidiaries then-outstanding indebtedness. 
 The 1994 Indenture does not contain provisions with respect to future guarantors.

 26 

binding absent manifest error) that Adjusted Term SOFR or the EURIBO Rate, as applicable, cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof, or (ii) the Majority Banks determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Term Benchmark Loan, or a conversion thereto or a continuation thereof that Adjusted Term SOFR or the EURIBO Rate, as applicable, for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term Benchmark Loan, as applicable, does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of making and maintaining such Loan, and the Majority Banks have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then upon prompt notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers and each Bank, (a) each Term Benchmark Loan made by such Bank will automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in dollars, be converted into an ABR Loan and (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in euros, be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of dollars and be converted into an ABR Loan and (b) any obligation of the Banks to make Term Benchmark Loans denominated in dollars or euros, as applicable, and any right of any Borrower to continue Term Benchmark Loans denominated in dollars or euros, as applicable, or to convert ABR Loans to Term Benchmark Loans denominated in dollars, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term Benchmark Loans, or affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice.

 (b) The obligations of each Credit Party in respect of any sum due to any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note in any currency (the Primary Currency shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency (the Judgment Currency ), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the applicable Primary Currency, each Credit Party agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds the sum of (i) the amount originally due to such Bank 
 27 

or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and (ii) any amounts shared with other Banks as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Bank under Section 11.05, such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the relevant Credit Party.

 (b) the Majority Banks advise the Administrative Agent that the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the EURIBO Rate (as applicable), as determined by the Administrative Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Term Benchmark Loans in dollars or euros, as applicable, for such Interest Period, 
 the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist (which the Administrative Agent agrees to do promptly after such circumstances no longer exist), (i) each Term Benchmark Loan denominated in dollars will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into an ABR Loan, (ii) each Term Benchmark Loan denominated in euros shall be prepaid by the applicable Borrower or exchanged into an Equivalent amount of dollars and converted into an ABR Loan and (iii) the obligations of the Banks to make, or to convert or continue, Term Benchmark Loans in the affected currency shall be suspended. Unless the relevant Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days before the date of (x) any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in dollars for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as an ABR Borrowing or (y) any Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in euros for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of dollars and converted into an ABR Borrowing.

Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.02, such Bank shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Term Benchmark Loans to the relevant Borrower to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, such Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such Term Benchmark Loan, together with accrued interest thereon. Concurrently with prepaying each such Term Benchmark Loan, such Borrower shall borrow an ABR Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Term Benchmark Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such an ABR Loan.

 (3) Each Bank will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.03 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section 8.03 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

 Section 10.03. Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances . Except as set forth in Section 10.08, each Guarantor s obligations under this Article 10 shall remain in full force and effect until the Aggregate Commitments shall have terminated and the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by any Borrower under this Agreement and each other Loan Document (other than contingent indemnification and reimbursement obligations for which no claim has been asserted) shall have been paid in full.

 72 

(2) If any Bank shall obtain from any Borrower payment of any principal of or interest on a Loan or payment of any other amount under this Agreement or any Note through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker s lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise (other than from the Administrative Agent as provided herein), and, as a result of such payment, such Bank shall have received a percentage of the principal of or interest on such Loan or such other amounts then due hereunder by such Borrower to such Bank in excess of its pro rata share thereof, it shall promptly purchase from such other Banks participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Bank, direct interests in) the Loans or such other amounts, respectively, owing to such other Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may be incurred by such Bank in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal of and or interest on the Loans or such other amounts, respectively, owing to each of the Banks.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank s rights shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.03 or Section 8.04 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Company s prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02, Section 8.03 or Section 8.04 requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. 
 (e) Certain Pledges .

connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document, any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder or any litigation or proceeding to which the Administrative Agent or any Bank or any of its respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) subject to an agreement containing or incorporating provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 11.11, to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (B) any actual or prospective party (or its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives), surety, reinsurer, guarantor or credit liquidity enhancer (or their advisors) to or in connection with any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Company and its obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or by reference to this Agreement or payments hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (C) any rating agency when required by it, or (D) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar organization, with the consent of the Company or (vii) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.11 or (B) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement (but not the contents beyond that contained on the cover page hereof) to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agent and the Banks in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments. 
 For the purposes of this Section 11.11, Information means all information received from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries provided that, in the case of information received from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.11 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, each party hereto (and each party s employees, representatives or other agents) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the United States tax treatment and United States tax structure of this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such United States tax treatment and United States tax structure, other than any information for which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws. 
 (2) Certain of the Banks may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that does not contain material non-public information with respect to Parent or the Company or their respective securities Restricting Information ). Other Banks may enter into this Agreement and take or not take action hereunder or under the other Loan Documents on the basis of information that may contain Restricting Information. Each Bank acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities on the basis of material, non-public information concerning such issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other Person. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall, by making any Communications (including Restricting Information) available to a Bank, by participating in any conversations or other interactions with a Bank or otherwise, make or be deemed to make any statement with regard to or otherwise warrant that any such information or Communication does or does not contain Restricting Information nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties be responsible or 
 79 

liable in any way for any decision a Bank may make to limit or to not limit its access to Restricting Information. In particular, none of the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties (i) shall have, and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties, hereby disclaims, any duty to ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Bank has or has not limited its access to Restricting Information, such Bank s policies or procedures regarding the safeguarding of material, non-public information or such Bank s compliance with applicable laws related thereto or (ii) shall have, or incur, any liability to any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any Bank or any of their respective Related Parties arising out of or relating to the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Bank. 
 (3) The Company agrees that (i) all Communications it provides to the Administrative Agent intended for delivery to the Banks whether by posting to the Approved Electronic Platform or otherwise shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC if such Communications do not contain Restricting Information which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page thereof, (ii) by marking Communications PUBLIC, the Company shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Banks to treat such Communications as either publicly available information or not material information (although, in this latter case, such Communications may contain sensitive business information and, therefore, remain subject to the confidentiality undertakings of clause (a) above) with respect to Parent or the Company or their respective securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws, (iii) all Communications marked PUBLIC may be delivered to all Banks and may be made available through a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated Public Side Information , and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall treat any Communications that are not marked PUBLIC as Restricting Information and will not post such Communications to a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated Public Side Information . Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be responsible for any statement or other designation by the Company regarding whether a Communication contains or does not contain material non-public information with respect to Parent or the Company or their respective securities nor shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties incur any liability to the Credit Parties, any Bank or any other Person for any action taken by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties based upon such statement or designation, including any action as a result of which Restricting Information is provided to a Bank that may decide not to take access to Restricting Information. Nothing in this clause (c) shall modify or limit a Bank s obligations under clause (a) with regard to Communications and the maintenance of the confidentiality of or other treatment of Information. 
 (4) Each Bank acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to refer to Communications that might contain Restricting Information. Accordingly, each Bank agrees that it will nominate at least one designee to receive Communications (including Restricting Information) on its behalf and identify such designee (including such designee s contact information) on such Bank s Administrative Questionnaire. Each Bank agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time of such Bank s designee s e-mail address to which notice of the availability of Restricting Information may be sent by electronic transmission. 
 (5) Each Bank acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder and under the other Loan Documents may contain Restricting Information and that such Communications are available to all Banks generally. Each Bank that elects not to take access to Restricting Information does so voluntarily and, by such election, acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and other Banks may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Bank. None of the Administrative Agent nor any Bank with access to Restricting Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing Bank or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Bank, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, such Restricting Information. 
 80 

(6) The provisions of the foregoing clauses of this Section 11.11 are designed to assist the Administrative Agent, the Banks and the Company in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Banks express a desire not to receive Restricting Information notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or other information provided to the Banks hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting Information. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or make any other statement to the effect that the Company s or any Bank s adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by the Company or such Bank with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in respect of Restricting Information and each of the Banks and the Company assumes the risks associated therewith. 
 Section 11.12. Severability . In case any provision in this Agreement or in any Note shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severable from the rest of this Agreement or such Note, as the case may be, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 
 Section 11.13. Survival . The obligations of the Borrowers under Section 2.14, Section 2.16, Section 2.17, Section 8.03(a), Section 8.03(b), Section 8.04, Section 8.06 and Section 11.04, and the obligations of the Banks under Section 7.05, shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments (provided that any such obligation shall not survive for more than one year after the later of such events) and, in the case of any Bank that may assign any interest in its Commitment or Loans, shall survive the making of such assignment, notwithstanding that such assigning Bank may cease to be a Bank hereunder, and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent. In addition, each representation and warranty made, or deemed to be made by a notice of any Loan, herein or pursuant hereto shall survive the making of such representation and warranty, and no Bank shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of making any Loan, any Default that may arise by reason of such representation or warranty proving to have been false or misleading, notwithstanding that such Bank or the Administrative Agent may have had notice or knowledge or reason to believe that such representation or warranty was false or misleading at the time such extension of credit was made. 
 Section 11.14. Waiver of Jury Trial . EACH CREDIT PARTY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 Section 11.16. No Fiduciary Relationship . The Credit Parties acknowledge that neither any Bank nor the Administrative Agent has any fiduciary relationship with, or fiduciary duty to any Credit Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Notes, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Banks, on the one hand, and the Credit Parties, on the other, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor.
