 forecast, potential, continue negatives thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are
not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level
of activity, performance or achievement to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. 

We
cannot predict all the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results
or conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved, and we do not assume any responsibility
for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places

These
forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject
to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ
materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. Considering these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,

the shareholders of AmpliTech, Inc. in exchange for of the outstanding shares of AmpliTech Inc. (the Share Exchange ).
After the Share Exchange, the selling shareholders owned shares of the outstanding shares of Company common stock, resulting
in a change in control. Accordingly, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which AmpliTech, Inc. was deemed to
be the accounting acquirer, and the operations of the Company were consolidated for accounting purposes. The capital balances have been
retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse acquisition. 

AmpliTech
designs, engineers and assembles microwave component based low noise amplifiers LNA that meet individual customer specifications.
Application of the Company s proprietary technology results in maximum frequency gain with minimal background noise distortion
as required by each customer. The Company has both domestic and international customers in such industries as aerospace, governmental,
defense and commercial satellite. 

On
September 12, 2019, AmpliTech Group, Inc. acquired the assets of Specialty Microwave Corporation Specialty ), a privately
held company based in Ronkonkoma, NY. The purchase included all inventory, orders, customers, property and equipment, and all intellectual
property. The assets also included all eight team members of Specialty. 

Specialty
designs and manufactures passive microwave components and related subsystems that meet individual customer specifications for both domestic
and international customers for use in satellite communication ground networks. 

On
February 17, 2021, AmpliTech Group, Inc., common stock and warrants under the symbols AMPG and AMPGW , respectively,
commenced trading on NASDAQ. A reverse split of the outstanding common stock at a ratio became effective February 17, 2021 as
of 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time. In connection with the public offering, units at an offering price of per unit were sold.
Each unit issued in the offering consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant. 

In
2021, the Company opened AGMDC, a monolithic microwave integrated circuits MMIC chip design center in Texas and has started
to implement several of its proprietary amplifier designs into MMIC components. MMICs are semiconductor chips used in high-frequency
communications applications. MMICs are widely desired for power amplification solutions to service emerging technologies, such as phased
array antennas and quantum computing. MMICs carry a smaller footprint enabling them to be incorporated into a broader array of systems
while reducing costs. AGMDC designs, develops and manufactures state-of-the-art signal processing components for satellite and 5G communications
networks, defense, space and other commercial applications, allowing the Company to market its products to a wider base of customers
requiring high technology in smaller packages.

to be valid, but no longer exists. The Company is taking steps in an attempt to seek recovery of the funds including discussions with
local, federal, and international law enforcement agencies and private consultants and is currently conducting a review of its processes
and procedures related to this investment. At the present time, the Company is not aware of, and does not expect any additional losses
arising out or relating to the above-described investment. In addition, the Company does not believe that the Company s systems,
records, or other assets were otherwise affected or compromised in connection with these investments.

a result of the fraudulent digital currency transactions noted above, the Company was a victim of a cyber phishing scam that defrauded
the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a complete loss from the investment in digital assets

We
estimate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future
cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate
the future cash flows used to measure fair value. Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated
market conditions and internal projections and operating plans. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount
rates, and estimated royalty rates for our indefinite-lived intangible assets. 

During

Determine
the transaction price . Payment by the customer is due under customary fixed payment terms, and we evaluate if collectability is reasonably
assured. None of our contracts as of September 30, 2024 contained a significant financing component. Revenue is recorded at the net sales
price, which includes estimates of variable consideration such as product returns, rebates, discounts, and other adjustments. The estimates
of variable consideration are based on historical payment experience, historical and projected sales data, and current contract terms.
Variable consideration is included in revenue only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue recognized
will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Taxes collected from customers
relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. 

Allocate
the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract . We typically do not have multiple performance obligations in our
contracts with customers. We recognize revenue upon transfer of the product to the customer s control at contractually stated pricing. 

Recognize
revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. We generally satisfy performance obligations at a point in time upon either
shipment or delivery of goods, in accordance with the terms of each contract with the customer. We do not have significant service revenue.

Cash
and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and customer deposits approximate
fair value, due to their short-term nature. The carrying value of notes payable and short and long-term debt also approximates fair value
since these instruments bear market rates of interest. 

Assets
and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to long-lived assets, intangible assets, and
goodwill, which are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value in the consolidated balance sheets.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of
operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements, which involve risks
and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results, expectations and plans discussed in these forward-looking
statements. 

Business
Overview 

AmpliTech
Group Inc. AMPG, AmpliTech or the Company ), incorporated in 2010 in the state of Nevada, is
the parent company of its subsidiary, AmpliTech, Inc., and the Company s divisions Specialty Microwave, Spectrum Semiconductor
Materials, AmpliTech Group MMIC Design Center AGMDC and AmpliTech Group True G Speed Services AGTGSS ). 

AmpliTech,
Inc. designs, engineers, and assembles microwave component-based low noise amplifiers LNA that meet individual customer
specifications. Application of the Company s proprietary technology results in maximum frequency gain with minimal background noise
distortion as required by each customer. The Company has both domestic and international customers in such industries as aerospace, governmental,
defense, and commercial satellite. 

Specialty
designs and manufactures passive microwave components and related subsystems that meet individual customer specifications for both domestic
and international customers for use in satellite communication ground networks. 

AGMDC
designs, develops and manufactures state-of-the-art signal processing components for satellite and 5G communications networks, defense,
space and other commercial applications, allowing the Company to market its products to wider base of customers requiring high technology
in smaller packages. 

Spectrum
Semiconductor Materials SSM ), located in Silicon Valley (San Jose, CA), is a global authorized distributor of integrated
circuit IC packaging and lids for semiconductor device assembly, prototyping, testing, and production requirements. 

In
August 2022, we formed our AGTGSS division to enable true G speeds to the industry. AGTGSS main function will be
to plan and configure 5G radio systems and make them O-RAN compliant. AGTGSS will implement AmpliTech s low noise amplifier devices
in these systems to promote greater coverage, longer range and faster speeds. 

Our
mission is to patent our proprietary IP and trade secrets that were used in small volume niche markets and expand our capabilities through
strategic partnerships, joint ventures, mergers/acquisitions with key industry leaders in the 5G/6G, quantum computing, and cybersecurity
markets. We believe this will enable us to scale up our products and revenue by developing full systems and subsystems with our unique
technology as a core component, which we expect will position us as a global leader in these rapidly emerging technology sectors and
addresses large volume markets as well, such as cellphone handsets, laptops, server networks, and many other applications that improve
everyday quality of life. 

The
Company s research and development initiative to expand its product line of low noise amplifiers to include its new 5G and wireless
infrastructure products and MMIC designs is progressing significantly. Our combined engineering and manufacturing resources are expected
to complement the development of new subsystems for satellite, wireless, and 5G infrastructure, as well as advanced military and commercial
markets.

Loss
on Investment of Digital Assets 

During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company made several transactions in digital currency in the total amount of approximately
 3.25 million. The Company believes that it was fraudulently induced to hold its digital currency with a custodian whom the Company believed
to be valid, but no longer exists. The Company is taking steps in an attempt to seek recovery of the funds including discussions with
local, federal, and international law enforcement agencies and private consultants and is currently conducting a review of its processes
and procedures related to this investment. At the present time, the Company is not aware of, and does not expect any additional losses
arising out or relating to the above-described investment. In addition, the Company does not believe that the Company s systems,
records, or other assets were otherwise affected or compromised in connection with these investments. 

As
a result of the fraudulent digital currency transactions noted above, the Company was a victim of a cyber phishing scam that defrauded
the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a complete loss from the investment in digital assets
of 3,248,911. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining balance of digital assets was 0.

Operating
Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements 

As

reduced by revenue from new products that were developed earlier this year. As of September 30, 2024, we maintain cash and cash equivalents
of 1.1 million. Based on our existing cash and cash equivalents, our working capital, our current and forecasted level of operations,
and our forecasted cash flows, we believe that we will be able to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due and to provide for our capital requirements for the next 12 months. We are actively seeking dilutive
or non-dilutive capital to support our growth. 

Critical
Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions 

The
SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management s view, most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgment and estimates. 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon financial statements which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including the allowance for doubtful accounts, the salability and recoverability of inventory, income taxes and contingencies.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes there
have been no significant changes during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, to the items disclosed as critical accounting
policies in management s discussion and analysis in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023. 

36 

We
cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess
the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare
our financial statements when we deem it necessary.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 

Based
on that evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes that have affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report. Please refer to the Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on May 28, 2024 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed with
the SEC on August 14, 2024. 

We
will continue to enhance corporate oversight over process-level controls and structures to ensure that there is appropriate assignment
of authority, responsibility, and accountability to enable remediation of our material weaknesses. We believe that our remediation plan
will be sufficient to rectify the identified material weaknesses and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. As we
continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional measures
to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary.

As

cash flows for the remainder of the year and into early next quarter of 2025, although we anticipate that our operating losses to be

or non-dilutive capital to support our growth. 

The
listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market is contingent on our compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market s
conditions for continued listing. On September 27, 2024, the Company received a notice (the Notice from The NASDAQ
Stock Market LLC indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of 1.00 per share under
the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the Listing Rules ). Based on the closing bid price of the Company s listed securities
for the last 30 consecutive business days from August 15, 2024 to September 26, 2024, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid
price requirement set forth in Listing Rules 5550(a)(2). The Notice is only a notification of deficiency and has no current effect
on the listing or trading of the Company s securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Notice states that under the Listing
Rules 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company is provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 26, 2025, to regain
compliance under the Listing Rules. To regain compliance under the Listing Rules, the Company s common stock must be at least
 1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by March 26, 2025, the
Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

76 weeks through 38 bi-weekly payments of 44,816 and bears an annual interest rate of 21.2 with prepayment options. The loan is secured
by the Company s assets through an UCC filing. The balance as of September 30, 2024 was 1,139,429, net of the debt discount. Principal
payments of 224,080 and 89,509 of interest expense were paid for the nine-month ended September 30, 2024. In the event the Company is
