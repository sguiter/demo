ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters. These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations, including the following: 

Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Partnership owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate; 

the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for the Partners; 

resolution by the General Partners of conflicts with which they may be confronted; 

the success of the General Partners of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics; 

the effect of tenant defaults; and 

the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Partnership operate. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The Partnership s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Partnership s assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. It is possible that the carrying amount of the Partnership s assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, would be affected if management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate. 

Management of the Partnership evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the Managing General Partner of the Partnership. 

9

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties 

Upon acquisition of real properties, the Partnership records them in the financial statements at cost. The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market in-place leases. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the relative fair value of each component of the property. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management s assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset. 

The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods. The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. Below market lease values will be amortized on a straight-line basis as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income. 

The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management s consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed. 

The determination of the relative fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables. If management s estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income. 

10

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

Carrying Value of Properties 

Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Partnership tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For properties the Partnership will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value. For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value. Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties. 

Allocation of Expenses 

AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund s affairs. They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund s operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund s capitalization relative to other funds they manage. The Partnership reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Partnership Agreement. 

Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 

The Partnership is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues and investment property value. However, due to current economic factors, higher interest rates, and inflation in the US and globally, our tenants and operating partners may be impacted. 

Results of Operations 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Partnership recognized rental income of 749,550 and 747,581, respectively. In 2024, rental income increased due to a property with a rent increase in both August 2023 and August 2024. Based on the scheduled rent for the properties owned as of October 31, 2024, the Partnership expects to recognize rental income of approximately 1,000,000 in 2024. 

11

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration expenses from affiliated parties of 121,129 and 123,220, respectively. These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Partners. During the same periods, the Partnership incurred Partnership administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of 69,150 and 69,849, respectively. These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Partnership recognized interest income of 2,695 and 2,199, respectively. 

Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations. Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases. Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value. However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Partnership's cash balances increased 14,143 and 11,863, respectively, as a result of cash generated from operating activities in excess of distributions paid to Partners. 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 531,562 in 2023 to 533,842 in 2024 as a result of an increase in total rental income and a decrease in Partnership administration and property management expenses. 

The Partnership's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Partners and cash used to repurchase Units. The Partnership declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter. The Partnership attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter. The Partnership may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations. 

12

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued) 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Partnership declared distributions of 519,699, which were distributed 99 to the Limited Partners and 1 to the General Partners. The Limited Partners were allocated declared distributions of 514,503 and the General Partners were allocated declared distributions of 5,196 for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The Partnership may repurchase Units from Limited Partners who have tendered their Units to the Partnership. Such Units may be acquired at a discount. The Partnership will not be obligated to purchase in any year any number of Units that, when aggregated with all other transfers of Units that have occurred since the beginning of the same calendar year (excluding Permitted Transfers as defined in the Partnership Agreement), would exceed 5 of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Partnership be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing General Partner, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Partnership. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Partnership did not repurchase any Units from the Limited Partners. 

The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Partnership obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Partnership had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Managing General Partner concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Managing General Partner, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

During the most recent period covered by this report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
