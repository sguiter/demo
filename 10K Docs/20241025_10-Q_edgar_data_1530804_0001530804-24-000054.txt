We believe that vertical integration is the best way to achieve our ultimate goal of delivering low cost, high-quality pigment to our coatings and other TiO 2 customers throughout the world. The mining, beneficiation and smelting of titanium bearing mineral sands creates meaningful quantities of zircon, pig iron and the rare-earth bearing mineral, monazite, which we also supply to customers around the world.

 t have any material contract asset balances. 
 Contract liabilities represent our obligations to transfer products to a customer for which we have received consideration from the customer. From time to time, we may receive advance payment from our customers that is accounted for as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is earned when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is typically within a short period of time from when we received the advanced payment. Contract liability balances as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were less than million. Contract liability balances were reported as Accounts payable in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. All material contract liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were recognized as revenue in Net sales in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 We operate under operating and reportable segment, Tronox. We disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by product type and geographic area. We believe this level of disaggregation appropriately depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors and reflects how our business is managed.

 3.) ) ) ) Income (loss) before income taxes ) Effective tax rate ) 
 Tronox Holdings plc, a U.K. public limited company is the parent company for the business group, and the statutory tax rate in the U.K. at both September 30, 2024 and 2023 was . The statutory rate in the U.K. changed to effective April 1, 2023 and a weighted average of was applied for the full year 2023. The effective tax rates for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are impacted by a variety of factors including income and losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, non-taxable income and expense items, prior year accruals, and our jurisdictional mix of income at tax rates different than the U.K. statutory rate. 
 
 At each reporting date, we perform an analysis to determine the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets and whether any valuation allowances are required. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income (including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible. Our analysis takes into consideration all available positive and negative evidence, including prior operating results, the nature and reason for any losses, our forecast of future taxable income, utilization of tax planning strategies, and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire. These assumptions and estimates require a significant amount of judgment and are made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we identified negative evidence concerning our ability to realize our Brazilian deferred tax assets. This evidence primarily relates to operational losses generated during the current year, a three-year cumulative loss threshold crossed during the quarter, and fluctuating levels of income and expenses which have led to uncertainty regarding the region's ability to generate net income in the foreseeable future. As a result, we recorded a full valuation allowance against Brazil's million in deferred tax assets. 
 
 We continue to maintain full valuation allowances related to the total net deferred tax assets in Australia and the United Kingdom, as we cannot objectively assert that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Until these valuation allowances are eliminated, future provisions for income taxes for these jurisdictions will include no tax benefits with respect to losses incurred and tax expense only to the extent of current tax payments. Additionally, we have valuation allowances against specific tax assets in China, South Africa and the United States. 
 
 The Company currently has uncertain tax positions recorded. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for income taxes that may be payable with respect to years open for examination or currently under examination. With regard to years under examination, the ultimate outcome is not presently known and, accordingly, adjustments to our provisions may be necessary and/or reclassifications of noncurrent tax liabilities to current may occur in the future. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the United Kingdom enacted legislation consistent with guidance from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") for the implementation of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two). Additionally, various other jurisdictions have now implemented domestic minimum taxes which are also effective for 2024. Neither the UK multinational top-up tax nor any jurisdiction's domestic minimum tax are expected to have a material impact on our income tax provisions for 2024.

 In March 2024, we entered into a Securitization Facility technical amendment (the "Third Amendment"), to increase the percentage of certain receivables eligible for sale to the Purchaser. In April 2024, we again amended the Securitization Facility (the "Fourth Amendment"), to increase the facility limit from million to million. 
 As the Company does not maintain effective control over the sold receivables, we derecognize the sold receivables from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and classify the cash proceeds as source of cash from operating activities in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

This resulted in the Company recording million within "Accounts payable" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023, as this amount is due to the Purchaser as a result of a periodic decrease in accounts receivable sold to the Purchaser, which was paid in January 2024. There were no corresponding amounts in Accounts Payable as of September 30, 2024.

The 2024 Amendment provides the Borrower with a new incremental term loan facility ("the 2024 Term Loan Facility" and the loan thereunder, the "2024 Term Loans") in an aggregate initial principal amount of million under its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of

Table of Contents 

 of the original principal amount of the 2024 Term Loan Facility commencing with the second full fiscal quarter after the effective date of the 2024 Term Loan Facility. The final maturity of the 2024 Term Loan Facility will occur on April 4, 2029. The 2024 Term Loan Facility permits amendments thereto whereby individual lenders may extend the maturity date of their outstanding loans upon the Borrower's request without the consent of any other lender, so long as certain conditions are met. The 2024 Term Loan Facility shall bear interest, at the Borrower's option, at either the base rate or the SOFR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin in respect of the 2024 Term Loan Facility is per annum for base rate loans or per annum for SOFR rate loans. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Facility contains the same negative covenants applicable to the term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Amendment, which covenants, subject to certain limitations, thresholds and exceptions, limit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to (among other restrictions): incur indebtedness; grant liens; pay dividends and make subsidiary and certain other distributions; sell assets; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and make certain modifications to material documents (including organizational documents). 
 2024-B Term Loan Facility 
 On September 30, 2024, the Borrower (as defined above), together with the Company and certain of the Company's subsidiaries, entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Credit Agreement (as defined above) with the term lenders party thereto and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. Amendment No. 6 provides the Borrower with a new incremental term loan facility (the "2024-B Term Loan Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of million. The proceeds of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility was used to refinance in full all of the outstanding amounts of the existing Term Loan Facility. 
 The obligations of the Borrower under the 2024-B Term Loan Facility are guaranteed and secured by the same guarantees and liens under the Credit Agreement prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6. The 2024-B Term Loan Facility is a separate class of loans under the Credit Agreement, and if the Borrower elects to make an optional payment under the Credit Agreement or is required to make a mandatory prepayment under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower may, in each case, select which class or classes of loans to prepay. 
 The 2024-B Term Loan Facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to of the original principal amount of the 2024-B Term Loans commencing with the second full fiscal quarter after the effective date of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility. The final maturity of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility will occur on September 30, 2031. The 2024-B Refinancing Facility permits amendments thereto whereby individual lenders may extend the maturity date of their outstanding loans upon the Borrower s request without the consent of any other lender, so long as certain conditions are met. The 2024-B Term Loans shall bear interest, at the Borrower s option, at either the base rate or the SOFR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin in respect of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility is per annum for base rate loans or per annum for SOFR rate loans. 
 The 2024-B Term Loan Facility contains the same negative covenants applicable to the term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6, which covenants, subject to certain limitations, thresholds and exceptions, limit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to (among other restrictions): incur indebtedness; grant liens; pay dividends and make subsidiary and certain other distributions; sell assets; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and make certain modifications to material documents (including organizational documents). The 2024-B Term Loan Facility also contains the same representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default applicable to the term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6.

 RMB Term Loan Facility and RMB Revolving Credit Facility 
 On August 16, 2024, Tronox Minerals Sands Proprietary Limited and Tronox KZN Sands Proprietary Limited, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into Amendment No. 2 the Amendment and restatement of a credit facility with RMB, that supersedes and replaces the Standard Bank Term Loan Facility and the Standard Bank Revolving Credit Facility in their entirety. The amended credit facility provides the Company with (a) a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of R billion (approximately million at September 30, 2024 exchange rate) (the "RMB Term Loan Facility") and (b) a new revolving credit facility (the "RMB Revolving Credit Facility") providing an increase of the revolving commitments of R billion (approximately million at September 30, 2024 exchange rate). The maturity date on the RMB Term Loan Facility and the RMB Revolving Credit Facility is August 16, 2029 and August 16, 2027, respectively. Mandatory capital repayments of R million (approximately million at September 30, 2024 exchange rate) are scheduled quarterly with the first mandatory repayment starting in March 31, 2025. 
 Both the RMB Term Loan Facility and RMB Revolving Credit Facility shall bear interest at an adjusted JIBAR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin on the RMB Term Loan Facility is . The applicable margin on the RMB Revolving Credit Facility is based upon average credit utilization during any interest period. If the revolving credit facility utilization is less than 33 , less than 66 but greater than 33 , or greater than 66 , the applicable margin is , , and , respectively. The RMB Revolving Credit Facility requires the borrower to pay customary agency fees. 
 Short-Term Debt 
 New Cash Flow Revolver 
 On August 15, 2024, the Borrower (as defined above), together with the Company and certain of the Company's subsidiaries, entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement (as defined above) with the revolving lenders party thereto and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. Amendment No. 5 provides for a million replacement revolving loan facility (the "New Cash Flow Revolver") which refinances and replaces the Borrower's existing million revolving loan facility (the "Cash Flow Revolver"). 
 The obligations of the Borrower under the New Cash Flow Revolver are guaranteed and secured by the same guarantees and liens under the Credit Agreement prior to the effective date of Amendment No. 5. The New Cash Flow Revolver is a separate class of loans under the Credit Agreement. 
 The maturity date of the New Cash Flow Revolver will occur on the earlier of (a) August 15, 2029 and (b) the Springing Maturity Date. The Springing Maturity Date is defined under the Credit Agreement as the earlier of the date that is 91 days prior to (i) the scheduled maturity date of the Borrower's 2028 term loans if on such date the outstanding amount of 2028 term loans is greater than million, (ii) the scheduled maturity date of the Borrower's 2029 term loans if on such date the outstanding amount of 2029 term loans is greater than million, (iii) the stated maturity date of the Senior Unsecured 2029 if on such date the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Unsecured 2029 Notes is greater than million, and (iv) the stated maturity date of certain debt-for-borrowed money (excluding debt issued under the Borrower's inside maturity date basket and certain other debt baskets under the Credit Agreement) incurred after the date of Amendment No. 5 if on such date the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such debt-for-borrowed money is greater than million. 
 The New Cash Flow Revolver shall bear interest, at the Borrower's option, at either the base rate or the SOFR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin in respect of the New Cash Flow Revolver shall be determined based on the Borrower's first lien net leverage ratio as of the then most recently ended fiscal quarter and shall range from to per annum for base rate loans or to per annum for SOFR rate loans. 
 The New Cash Flow Revolver contains substantially the same negative covenants applicable to the existing Cash Flow Revolver, which covenants, subject to certain limitations, thresholds and exceptions, limit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to (among other restrictions): incur indebtedness; grant liens; pay dividends and make subsidiary and certain other distributions; sell assets; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and make certain modifications to

 Interest Rate Risk 
 As a result of the 2024 Amendment (discussed in Note 11), the Company noted that the hedged transaction associated with the interest rate swap with a notional value of million (which converted the variable rate to a fixed rate for a portion of the 2022 Term Loan Facility) had changed as the hedged transaction would now convert the variable rate to a fixed rate for a portion of the 2024 Term Loan Facility. There were no amendments to the terms of the million interest rate swap, including the notional value, index rate, or expiration date as a result of the 2024 Amendment. However, given the change in the hedged transaction, we completed a hedge effectiveness test and determined that this hedge instrument continues to be highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows related to the hedged transaction, enabling us to continue to apply hedge accounting over the remaining term of this hedge relationship. 
 In line with the original maturity date, one of the interest rate swap agreements (notional value of million) expired in September 2024. As a result of this, on September 26, 2024, the Company entered into new interest-rate swap agreements for a notional of million each with two counterparty banks, for an aggregate notional of million. These new agreements are effective as of September 30, 2024 and will mature on September 30, 2031, in line with the maturity date of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility following Amendment No.6 (discussed in Note 11). The Company has designated these new hedges as cash flow hedges with the objective of ensuring that the Company continues to achieve the offsetting effect to the interest rate volatility associated with the million portion of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility.

 million) novated its rights and obligations in the interest rate swap contracts to a new counterparty. No other terms and conditions of the interest rate swap contract were impacted by this transaction. We also determined that it is probable the new counterparty will perform its obligations under the interest rate swap agreements. However, following the novation, the Company terminated the existing interest rate swap agreement and simultaneously entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with the new counterparty bank with an effective date of September 30, 2024 and expiring on September 30, 2031 (in line with the maturity date of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility). At the time of this change, the Company determined that the interest payments hedged are still probable to occur, therefore, the gains accumulated of million on the previous interest rate swap are being amortized into interest expense through March 11, 2028, the original maturity of the previous term loan agreement. As a result of this transaction, we completed a hedge effectiveness test and determined that this hedge instrument is highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows related to the hedged transaction, enabling us to apply hedge accounting over the term of the new hedge relationship. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintains a total of million of interest rate swaps (with million maturing in March 2028 and million maturing in September 2031) with the objective in using the interest-rate swap agreements to add stability to interest expense and to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements. These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the net unrealized loss of million and the unrealized gain of million, respectively, was recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amounts recorded in interest expense related to the interest-rate swap agreements were million and million, respectively, of which a gain of approximately million and million, respectively, was reclassified from "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" to interest expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net amounts recorded in interest expense related to the interest-rate swap agreements were million and million, respectively, of which million for each period was reclassified from "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" to interest expense. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we enter into foreign currency contracts used to hedge forecasted third party non-functional currency sales for our South African subsidiaries and forecasted non-functional currency cost of goods sold for our Australian subsidiaries. Historically, we have used a combination of zero-cost collars or forward contracts to reduce the exposure. These foreign currency contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes to the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are recorded as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income, if these contracts remain highly effective, and are recognized in net sales or costs of goods sold in the period in which the forecasted transaction affects earnings or are recognized in other (expense) income, net when the transactions are no longer probable of occurring. As of September 30, 2024, we had notional amounts of million Australian dollars million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) that expire between October 30, 2024 and December 27, 2024 to reduce the exposure of our Australian subsidiaries cost of sales to fluctuations in currency rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had notional amounts of million South African Rand million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) that expire between October 30, 2024 and December 27, 2024 to reduce the exposure of our South African subsidiaries' third party sales to fluctuations in currency rates. At September 30, 2024, there was a net unrealized gain of million recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is expected to be fully recognized in earnings over the next twelve months. There were no corresponding amounts as of December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, there was an unrealized net loss of million recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, which was fully recognized in earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Letters of Credit At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of million, of which million were letters of credit, of which million is related to the sale of Hawkins Point as discussed below, and million were bank guarantees. Amounts for performance bonds were not material. 
 Environmental Matters It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flows. The timing of cash expenditures depends principally on the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. Included in these environmental matters is the following: 
 Hawkins Point Plant. Residual waste mud, known as Batch Attack Mud, and a spent sulfuric waste stream were deposited in an onsite repository (the Batch Attack Lagoon at a former TiO2 manufacturing site, Hawkins Point Plant in Baltimore, Maryland, operated by Cristal USA, Inc. from 1954 until 2011. We assumed responsibility for remediation of the Hawkins Point Plant when we acquired the TiO 2 business of Cristal in April 2019. On December 21, 2022, we sold the Hawkins Point Plant to the Maryland Port Administration ("MPA"), a state agency controlled by the Maryland Department of Transportation. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, MPA became the lead party in developing and implementing appropriate measures to address, treat, control, and mitigate the environmental conditions at the property under the regulatory oversight of the Maryland Department of the Environment ("MDE"). Under MPA ownership, the Hawkins Point Plant will be utilized for storage and beneficial reuse of dredged material from the Port of Baltimore. In exchange for transferring ownership of the site to MPA, Tronox has agreed to make scheduled, annual payments to MPA which together with scheduled, annual contributions from MPA will be used to remediate the property. The sale of the property to MPA did not have a material impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, we have a provision of million included in "Environmental liabilities" in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Hawkins Point Plant consistent with the accounting policy described above. 
 Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, prior acquisitions and divestitures, including our acquisition of Cristal, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following:

 On May 9, 2018, we entered into an Option Agreement with AMIC which is owned equally by Tasnee and Cristal. Under the terms of the Option Agreement, AMIC granted us an option (the Option to acquire of a special purpose vehicle (the SPV ), to which AMIC s ownership in a titanium slag smelter facility (the Slagger in The Jazan City for Primary and Downstream Industries in KSA will be contributed together with million of AMIC indebtedness (the AMIC Debt ). The AMIC Debt would remain outstanding debt of the SPV upon exercise of the Option. The Option may be exercised if the Slagger achieves certain production criteria related to sustained quality and tonnage of slag produced (the Option Criteria ). Likewise, AMIC may require us to acquire the Slagger on the same terms if the Option Criteria are satisfied. Furthermore,

 million for capital expenditures and operational expenses to facilitate the start-up of the Slagger (the Tronox Loans ). 
 On May 13, 2020, we amended the Option Agreement (the "First Amendment") with AMIC to address circumstances in which the Option Criteria cannot be satisfied. Pursuant to the First Amendment, Tronox has the right to acquire the SPV in exchange for (i) our forgiveness of the Tronox Loans principal and accrued interest thereon, and (ii) the SPV's assumption of million of indebtedness plus accrued interest thereon lent by AMIC to the SPV. Under the First Amendment, the SPV would not assume any of the AMIC Debt. 
 On May 10, 2023, AMIC and Tronox further amended the Option Agreement (the Second Amendment ). In the Second Amendment the parties acknowledged that the Option expired on May 10, 2023 without being exercised but agreed to continue negotiating until September 30, 2023 (the "Renegotiation Period") as to whether, and under what circumstances, Tronox may acquire the Slagger. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, the parties continued to negotiate as to whether, and under what circumstances, Tronox may acquire the Slagger and on February 21, 2024 the parties again amended the Option Agreement (the Third Amendment ), which extended the Renegotiation Period until the earlier of the repayment of the Tronox Loans or December 31, 2024, subject to certain early termination rights. The Third Amendment also provided that from the date the parties entered into the Second Amendment and through December 31, 2023, all chloride slag produced by the Slagger was delivered to Tronox as repayment in-kind of the Tronox Loans at a price based on a widely published index for feedstock less a nominal discount (the Slag Price ). Thereafter and until the end of the Renegotiation Period, of all chloride slag produced by the Slagger will be delivered to Tronox as repayment in-kind of the Tronox Loans based on the Slag Price and Tronox will purchase via cash settlements the remaining at the Slag Price. Full repayment of the Tronox Loans is required by January 2025 in either cash or in-kind through chloride slag deliveries. During July 2023, we also entered into an agreement with AMIC to act as their sales agent with regard to sales of slag fines to customers outside of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for an agreed upon commission fee to be paid.

 On December 29, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Cristal to acquire certain assets co-located at our Yanbu facility which produces metal grade TiCl 4 ("MGT"). Consideration for the acquisition is the assumption by Tronox of a million note payable to Cristal (the "MGT Loan"). MGT is used at a titanium "sponge" plant facility, of the ownership interests of which are held by Advanced Metal Industries Cluster and Toho Titanium Metal Co. Ltd ("ATTM"), a joint venture between AMIC and Toho Titanium Company Ltd. ATTM uses the TiCl 4 , which we supply by pipeline, for the production of titanium sponge, a precursor material used in the production of titanium metal. 
 On December 17, 2020 we completed the MGT transaction. Repayment of the million note payable is based on a fixed U.S. dollar amount per metric ton quantity of MGT delivered by us to ATTM over time and therefore the ultimate maturity date is variable in nature. If ATTM fails to purchase MGT from us under certain contractually agreed upon conditions, then at our election we may terminate the MGT supply agreement with ATTM and we will no longer owe any amount under the loan agreement with Cristal. We currently estimate the ultimate maturity to be between approximately three and , subject to actual future MGT production levels. The interest rate on the note payable is based on the SAIBOR plus a premium.

 Overview 
 Tronox Holdings plc (referred to herein as "Tronox", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our") operates titanium-bearing mineral sand mines and beneficiation operations in Australia and South Africa to produce feedstock materials that can be processed into TiO 2 for pigment, high purity titanium chemicals, including titanium tetrachloride, and Ultrafine titanium dioxide used in certain specialty applications. Our strategy is to be vertically integrated and produce enough feedstock materials to be as self-sufficient as possible in the production of TiO 2 at our nine TiO 2 pigment facilities located in the United States, Australia, Brazil, UK, France, the Netherlands, China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia KSA ). We believe that vertical integration is the best way to achieve our ultimate goal of delivering low cost, high-quality pigment to our coatings and other TiO 2 customers throughout the world. The mining, beneficiation and smelting of titanium bearing mineral sands creates meaningful quantities of zircon, pig iron and the rare-earth bearing mineral, monazite, which we also supply to customers around the world. 
 We are a public limited company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are registered under the laws of England and Wales. 
 
 Business Environment 
 The following discussion includes trends and factors that may affect future operating results: 
 Third quarter revenue increased 21 compared to the prior year, driven by higher sales volumes of TiO 2 , zircon and other products. For the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, TiO 2 revenue increased 10 driven by a 12 increase in volumes, partially offset by a 2 decline in TiO 2 average selling prices and mix, and foreign exchange rates remained relatively flat to the prior year. Zircon revenue increased 124 from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 due to a 134 increase in sales volumes partially offset by a 10 decline in average selling prices. Revenue from other products increased 61 from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings. Gross profit increased for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to higher sales volumes partially offset by the unfavorable impact of selling prices, including mix. 
 Sequentially, revenue decreased 2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower sales volumes of TiO 2 and zircon. TiO 2 revenues decreased 6 driven by an 7 decrease in volumes partially offset by a 1 increase in TiO 2 averages selling prices. Zircon revenue decreased 13 sequentially driven by a 12 decrease in sales volumes and a 1 decrease in average selling prices. Revenue from other products increased 39 from the second quarter of

 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings. Gross profit decreased from the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher production costs, lower sales volumes of TiO 2 and zircon, and headwinds on foreign exchange rates partially offset by the increase in other products revenue and favorable impact of selling prices, including mix. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total available liquidity was 668 million, including 167 million in cash and cash equivalents and 501 million available under revolving credit agreements. As of September 30, 2024, our total debt was 2.8 billion and net debt to trailing-twelve month Adjusted EBITDA was 5.0x with approximately 73 of our interest rates fixed through 2028. The Company has no financial covenants on its term loan or bonds and only one springing financial covenant on its New Cash Flow Revolver, which we do not expect to be triggered based on our current scenario planning.

 Net sales of 804 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 21 , compared to 662 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes of TiO 2 , zircon and other products. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 Net sales by type of product for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance Percentage TiO 2 
 616 558 58 10 Zircon 74 33 41 124 Other products 114 71 43 61 Total net sales 804 662 142 21 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, TiO 2 revenue was higher by 10 or 58 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase of 69 million in sales volumes partially offset by a decrease of 13 million in average selling prices, including mix. Foreign currency positively impacted TiO 2 revenue by 2 million primarily due to the weakening of the Euro. Zircon revenue increased 41 million primarily due to a 134 increase in sales volumes partially offset by a 10 decrease in average selling prices. Other products revenue increased 43 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings. 
 Gross profit of 128 million was 15.9 of net sales compared to 14.2 of net sales in the year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to: 
 the favorable impact of 3 points due to increased volumes across other products, and 
 the favorable impact of 2 points due to zircon volume growth substantially exceeding TiO 2 volume growth during the comparable period, partially offset by 
 the unfavorable impact of 2 points primarily due to a decrease in TiO 2 , and Zircon selling prices, including mix, and 
 the net unfavorable impact of approximately 1 point due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses of 74 million increased 12 million compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to a 6 million increase in employee costs and a 5 million increase in professional services. The remaining net increase was driven by individually immaterial amounts. 
 
 Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 54 million compared to 32 million in the prior year period. The increase of 22 million was primarily due to the higher sales volumes partially offset by lower selling prices of TiO 2 and Zircon and higher SG A expenses as discussed above. 
 Both interest expense and interest income remained relatively consistent quarter over quarter. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt was 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 which was primarily related to the refinancing of our US Term Loan Facility with the new 2024-B Term Loan Facility. 
 Other (expense) income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of approximately 8 million of net realized and unrealized foreign currency losses and 4 million of fees associated with the utilization of the Securitization Facility. The remaining amount was driven by other individually immaterial amounts. 
 We have established a full valuation allowance related to the total net deferred tax assets in Brazil, and we continue to maintain full valuation allowances related to the total net deferred tax assets in Australia and the United Kingdom. The provisions for income taxes associated with these jurisdictions include no tax benefits with respect to losses incurred and tax expense only to the extent of current tax payments. Additionally, we have valuation allowances against other specific tax assets. 
 The effective tax rate was 2,600 and (133) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are impacted by a variety of factors including income and losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, non-taxable income and expense items, prior year accruals, and our jurisdictional mix of income at tax rates different than the U.K. statutory rate.

Table of Contents 

 Net loss as a of net sales was 3.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.1 for the prior year period. The primary driver of the period over period increase is the higher SG A and loss on extinguishment of debt as discussed above partially offset by the increase in gross profit due to opportunistic sales of heavy mineral concentrate tailings. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 17.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.5 for the prior year primarily due to the higher gross margin as a result of higher zircon volumes growth and opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings partially offset by a higher SG A expenses as discussed above.

 Net sales of 2,398 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 11 compared to 2,164 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increases in sales volumes of both TiO 2 , zircon and other products. 
 Net sales by type of product for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

Table of Contents 

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance Percentage TiO 2

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, TiO 2 revenue was higher by 8 or 145 million compared to the prior year period. TiO 2 revenue increased primarily due to an increase of 272 million in sales volumes partially offset by a decrease of 127 million in average selling prices, including mix. Foreign currency remained consistent period over period. Zircon revenue increased 47 million primarily due to a 42 increase in sales volumes partially offset by a 18 decrease in average selling prices. Other products revenue increased 42 million primarily due to opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings. 
 Gross margin of 398 million was 16.6 of net sales compared to 17.7 of net sales in the year-ago period. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to: 
 the unfavorable impact of 6 points primarily due to a decrease in TiO 2 and Zircon selling prices, partially offset by 
 the favorable impact of 2 points due to improved absorption from higher production volumes, 
 the favorable impact of 1 point due to increased volumes across other products, 
 the favorable impact of 1 point due to zircon volume growth substantially exceeding TiO 2 volume growth during the comparable period, and 
 the net favorable impact of 1 point due to changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily due to the South African Rand and Australian dollar. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 21 million or 10 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year primarily driven by an 11 million increase in employee costs and a 8 million increase in professional services. The remaining net increase was driven by individually immaterial amounts. 
 Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 171 million compared to income from operations of 178 million in the prior year period. The decrease of 7 million was primarily due to lower selling prices of TiO 2 , Zircon and pig iron and higher SG A expenses partially offset by the improved absorption from higher production volumes and opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings as discussed above. 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 13 million compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to the increase in the outstanding debt balances and the effective interest rates on our long-term debt facilities period over period. 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt was 3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which was primarily related to the refinancing of our US Term Loan Facility with the new 2024-B Term Loan Facility. 
 Other (expense) income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of approximately 28 million (net of associated transaction costs) related to a sale of a royalty interest in certain Canadian mineral properties partially offset by 10 million of net realized and unrealized foreign currency losses and 11 million of fees associated with the utilization of the Securitization Facility. The remaining amount was driven by other individually immaterial amounts. 
 We have established a full valuation allowance related to the total net deferred tax assets in Brazil, and we continue to maintain full valuation allowances related to the total net deferred tax assets in Australia and the United Kingdom. The provisions for income taxes associated with these jurisdictions include no tax benefits with respect to losses incurred and tax expense only to the extent of current tax payments. Additionally, we have valuation allowances against other specific tax assets.

 The effective tax rate was 141 and 419 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are impacted by a variety of factors including income and losses in jurisdictions with valuation allowances, non-taxable income and expense items, prior year accruals, and our jurisdictional mix of income at tax rates different than the U.K. statutory rate. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against Brazil's deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against Australia's deferred tax assets. 
 
 Net loss as a of net sales was 1.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 11.9 for the prior year period. The primary driver of the period over period decrease is the timing of the deferred tax assets' valuation allowance adjustments, the sale of a royalty interest in certain Canadian properties and opportunistic sales of ilmenite and heavy mineral concentrate tailings in the current period partially offset by the lower gross margin due to the lower selling prices, higher SG A expenses, higher interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt as discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 18.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.8 points from 19.9 in the prior year. The lower gross margin and higher SG A were the primary drivers of the year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EBITDA percentage. 
 
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Other comprehensive income was 54 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other comprehensive loss of 20 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to the favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of 76 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of 27 million in the prior year period. This was partially offset by a net loss on derivative instruments of 22 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net gain on derivative instruments of 7 million in the prior year period. 
 Other comprehensive income was 34 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other comprehensive loss of 56 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to the favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of 49 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of 70 million in the prior year period. This was partially offset by a net loss on derivative instruments of 16 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net gain on derivative instruments of 14 million in the prior year period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table presents our liquidity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Millions of U.S. dollars) Cash and cash equivalents 167 273 Available under the Cash Flow Revolver 338 343 Available under the Standard Credit Facility 55 Available under the RMB Credit Facility 70 Available under the Emirates Revolver 67 64 Available under the SABB Facility 20 20 Available under the Bank Itau Facility 6 6 Total 668 761 
 Historically, we have funded our operations and met our commitments through cash generated by operations, issuance of unsecured notes, bank financings and borrowings under lines of credit. In the next twelve months, we expect that our operations will provide sufficient cash for our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments and debt repayments, however, if necessary, we have the ability to borrow under our short-term credit facilities (see Note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements). This is predicated on our achieving our forecast which could be negatively impacted by items outside of our control, including, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, inflationary pressures, political instability including the ongoing Russia and Ukraine and Middle East conflicts and any expansion of such conflicts, and

 supply chain disruptions. If negative events occur in the future, we may need to reduce our capital spend, cut back on operating costs and other items within our control to maintain adequate liquidity. 
 Working capital (calculated as current assets less current liabilities) was 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024 and 1.4 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of our Senior Notes due 2029 represented approximately 19 of our total consolidated liabilities and approximately 42 of our total consolidated assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of our Senior Notes due 2029 represented approximately 45 and 44 , respectively, of our total consolidated net sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of our Senior Notes due 2029 represented approximately 60 and 51 of our consolidated EBITDA (as such term is defined in the 2029 Indenture). In addition, as of September 30, 2024, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had 815 million of total consolidated liabilities (including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities), all of which would have been structurally senior to the 2029 Notes. See Note 11 of notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of 145 million. See Note 15 of notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include (i) debt covenants that limit our total borrowing capacity; (ii) increasing interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt; (iii) increasing demands from third parties for financial assurance or credit enhancement; (iv) credit rating downgrades, which could limit our access to additional debt; (v) a decrease in the market price of our common stock and debt obligations; and (vi) volatility in public debt and equity markets. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our credit rating with Moody s remained unchanged at Ba3 stable outlook and our Standard Poor's rating and outlook remained the same at B positive and stable, respectively. See Note 11 of notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 We consider all investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds and we also receive earnings credits for some balances left in our bank operating accounts. We maintain cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit and money market accounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The financial institutions where our cash and cash equivalents are held are highly rated and geographically dispersed, and we have a policy to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe we are not exposed to significant credit risk. 
 The use of our cash includes payment of our operating expenses, capital expenditures, servicing our interest and debt repayment obligations, cash taxes, making pension contributions and making quarterly dividend payments. Going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our businesses through cost reduction, as well as growth and vertical integration-related capital expenditures including projects such as newTRON, rare earths initiatives and various mine development projects, continued reductions in our debt, continued dividends and share repurchases. 
 Repatriation of Cash 
 At September 30, 2024, we held 167 million in cash and cash equivalents in these respective jurisdictions: 27 million in Europe, 8 million in the United States, 46 million in Australia, 17 million in Brazil, 37 million in South Africa, 14 million in Saudi Arabia, 17 million in China and 1 million in India. Our credit facilities limit transfers of funds from subsidiaries in the United States to certain foreign subsidiaries. 
 At September 30, 2024, Tronox Holdings plc had foreign subsidiaries with undistributed earnings. Although we would not be subject to income tax on these earnings, we have asserted that amounts in specific jurisdictions are indefinitely reinvested outside of the parent's taxing jurisdictions. These amounts could be subject to withholding tax if distributed, but the Company has made no provision for tax related to these undistributed earnings. In 2022, the Company removed its assertion that earnings in China are indefinitely reinvested, and since then, the withholding tax accruals for potential repatriations from that jurisdiction are reflected in the effective tax rate.

Table of Contents 

 In March 2024, we entered into a Securitization Facility technical amendment (the "Third Amendment"), to increase the percentage of certain receivables eligible for sale to the Purchaser. In April 2024, we again amended the Securitization Facility (the "Fourth Amendment"), to increase the Facility Limit from 200 million to 230 million. 
 See Note 5 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program in notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding this off-balance sheet program. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents cash flow for the periods indicated: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Millions of U.S. dollars) Cash provided by operating activities 218 74 Cash used in investing activities (226) (199) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (97) 207 Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (105) 82 
 Cash Flows provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of 218 million is primarily driven by 305 million of net income adjusted for non-cash items offset by a net cash outflow of 87 million related to changes in assets and liabilities. The following table provides our net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Millions of U.S. dollars) Net loss (24) (258) Adjustments for non-cash items 329 575 Income related cash generation 305 317 Net change in assets and liabilities (87) (243) Cash provided by operating activities 218 74 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 144 million year-over-year from 74 million in the prior year to 218 million during the current year. This increase was generated primarily due to lower use of cash for working capital in the current year primarily driven by increase of 82 million and 11 million in accounts receivables and inventories, respectively. 
 Cash Flows used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 226 million as compared to 199 million for the same period in 2023 primarily due to 21 million of proceeds from the sale of a royalty interest in certain Canadian mineral properties partially offset by higher capital expenditures of 253 million during the current year as compared to 202 million in the prior year. 
 Cash Flows (used in) provided by Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 97 million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 207 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily comprised of dividends paid of 61 million and total net repayments of 21 million of long-term debt and short-term debt. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of the proceeds from the 2023 Term Loan Facility of 347 million partially offset by 69 million used to pay dividends and 55 million of total repayments offset by drawdowns on several of our short-term debt facilities for general corporate purposes.

 Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a of Net Sales, Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tronox, Diluted adjusted net income per share attributable to Tronox and net debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, which are used by management to measure performance, are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding the impact of income taxes, interest expense, interest income and depreciation, depletion and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding the impact of nonrecurring items such as restructuring charges, gain or loss on debt extinguishments, impairment charges, gains or losses on sale of assets, acquisition-related transaction costs and pension settlements and curtailment gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items such as share-based compensation costs, pension and postretirement costs, and realized and unrealized foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses. We define Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tronox as net income (loss) attributable to Tronox excluding the impact of nonrecurring items which are the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results such as restructuring charges, gain or loss on debt extinguishments, impairment charges, gains or losses on sale of assets, acquisition-related transaction costs and pension settlements and curtailment gains or losses. We define Diluted adjusted net income per share attributable to Tronox as Diluted net income (loss) per share excluding the impact of nonrecurring items which are the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results such as restructuring charges, gain or loss on debt extinguishments, impairment charges, gains or losses on sale of assets, acquisition-related transaction costs and pension settlements and curtailment gains or losses. 
 Management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a of net sales, Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tronox, Diluted adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to Tronox and net debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors, as it is commonly used in the industry as a means of evaluating operating performance. We do not intend for these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial information. Readers of these statements should use these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures only in conjunction

 with the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Since other companies may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a of net sales, Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tronox, Diluted adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to Tronox and net debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a of net sales, Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Tronox, Diluted adjusted net income per share attributable to Tronox and net debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures: 
 reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparison and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude income and expense that are not reflective of ongoing operating results; 
 provide useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results and comparing financial results across periods; and 
 provide a normalized view of our operating performance by excluding items that are either noncash or infrequently occurring. 
 These non-U.S. GAAP measures are the primary measures management uses for planning and budgeting processes, and to monitor and evaluate financial and operating results. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation.

 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to a broad array of international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to safety, pollution, protection of the environment, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal, and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring, and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. Under these laws, we are or may be required to obtain or maintain permits or licenses in connection with our operations. In addition, under these laws, we are or may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of chemical, petroleum, low-level radioactive and other substances at our facilities. We may incur future costs for capital improvements

 and general compliance under environmental, health, and safety laws, including costs to acquire, maintain, and repair pollution control equipment. Environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and compliance costs are significant and will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future is not likely to have a material effect on our business. We believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations in all material respects.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to various market, credit, operational, and liquidity risks in the normal course of business, which are discussed below. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, with derivative instruments. We do not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes, but historically have entered into, and may enter into, derivative instruments for hedging purposes in order to reduce the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, natural gas prices and exchange rates. 
 Market Risk 
 A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities that reprice as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level of our profitability tend to vary with changes in the business cycle. Our TiO 2 prices may do so in the near term as ore prices and pigment prices are expected to fluctuate over the next few years. We try to protect against such instability through various business strategies. These include provisions in sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs through timely price increases and formula price contracts to transfer or share commodity price risk, enter into fixed purchase commitments to eliminate volatility in commodity purchases, as well as using varying contract term lengths and selling to a diverse mix of customers by geography and industry to reap the benefits of a diverse portfolio. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or a counterparty will fail to meet their obligations. A significant portion of our liquidity is concentrated in trade accounts receivable that arise from sales of our products to customers. In the case of TiO 2 , the high level of industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We have significant exposure to credit risk in industries that are affected by cyclical economic fluctuations. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers from time to time, as deemed appropriate, to mitigate credit risk but generally do not require collateral. Our contracts typically enable us to tighten credit terms if we perceive additional credit risk; however, historic losses due to write offs of bad debt have been insignificant. In addition, due to our international operations, we are subject to potential trade restrictions and sovereign risk in certain countries in which we operate. We maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on specific customer review and current financial conditions. During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our ten largest third-party customers represented 37 of our consolidated net sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no single customer accounted for 10 of our consolidated net sales. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will impact our financial results. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate debt, the 2024 Term Loan Facility, the 2024-B Term Loan Facility, RMB Term Loan Facility and the New Cash Flow Revolver, RMB Revolving Credit Facility, Emirates Revolver and SABB Credit Facility balances. Using a sensitivity analysis as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would result in a net decrease to pre-tax income of approximately 8 million on an annualized basis. This is due to the fact that earnings on our floating rate financial assets of 21 million at September 30, 2024 would increase by the full 1 , offsetting the impact of a 1 increase in interest expense on our floating rate debt of approximately 777 million. 
 As a result of the 2024 Amendment (discussed in Note 11), the Company noted that the hedged transaction associated with the interest rate swap with a notional value of 200 million (which converted the variable rate to a fixed rate for a portion of the 2022 Term Loan Facility) had changed as the hedged transaction would now convert the variable rate to a fixed rate for a portion of the 2024 Term Loan Facility. There were no amendments to the terms of the 200 million interest rate swap, including the notional value, index rate, or expiration date as a result of the 2024 Amendment. However, given the change in the hedged transaction, we completed a hedge effectiveness test and determined that this hedge instrument continues to be highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows related to the hedged transaction, enabling us to continue to apply hedge accounting over the remaining term of this hedge relationship. 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 In line with the original maturity date, one of the interest rate swap agreements (notional value of 250 million) expired in September 2024. As a result of this, on September 26, 2024, the Company entered into two new interest-rate swap agreements for a notional of 125 million each with two counterparty banks, for an aggregate notional of 250 million. These new agreements are effective as of September 30, 2024 and will mature on September 30, 2031, in line with the maturity date of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility following Amendment No.6 (discussed in Note 11). The Company has designated these two new hedges as cash flow hedges with the objective of ensuring that the Company continues to achieve the offsetting effect to the interest rate volatility associated with the 250 million portion of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility. 
 Additionally, on September 26, 2024, the counterparty bank associated with one of the existing interest rate swap contracts (notional value of 250 million) novated its rights and obligations in the interest rate swap contracts to a new counterparty. No other terms and conditions of the interest rate swap contract were impacted by this transaction. We also determined that it is probable the new counterparty will perform its obligations under the interest rate swap agreements. However, following the novation, the Company terminated the existing interest rate swap agreement and simultaneously entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with the new counterparty bank with an effective date of September 30, 2024 and expiring on September 30, 2031 (in line with the maturity date of the 2024-B Term Loan Facility). At the time of this change, the Company determined that the interest payments hedged are still probable to occur, therefore, the gains accumulated of 3 million on the previous interest rate swap are being amortized into interest expense through March 11, 2028, the original maturity of the previous term loan agreement. As a result of this transaction, we completed a hedge effectiveness test and determined that this hedge instrument is highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows related to the hedged transaction, enabling us to apply hedge accounting over the term of the new hedge relationship. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintains a total of 950 million of interest rate swaps (with 450 million maturing in March 2028 and 500 million maturing in September 2031) with the objective in using the interest-rate swap agreements to add stability to interest expense and to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements. These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The Company's objectives in using the interest rate swap agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the net unrealized loss of 7 million and the unrealized gain of 18 million, respectively, was recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amounts recorded in interest expense related to the interest-rate swap agreements were 7 million and 23 million, respectively, of which a gain of approximately 2 million and 5 million, respectively, was reclassified from "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" to interest expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net amounts recorded in interest expense related to the interest-rate swap agreements were 8 million and 18 million, respectively, of which 2 million for each period was reclassified from "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" to interest expense. 
 Refer to Note 12 of notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Currency Risk 
 Currency risk arises from the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact our balance sheets due to the translation of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, as well as our earnings due to the translation of certain of our subsidiaries statements of income from local currencies to U.S. dollars, as well as due to remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary s functional currency. We manufacture and market our products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The exposure is most prevalent in South Africa and Australia as the majority of revenues are earned in U.S. dollars while expenses are primarily incurred in local currencies. Since we are exposed to movements in the South African Rand, the Australian Dollar, the Euro and the Pound Sterling versus the U.S. dollar, we may enter into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies as economic hedges for these foreign currency transactions. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 From time to time, we enter into foreign currency contracts used to hedge forecasted third party non-functional currency sales for our South African subsidiaries and forecasted non-functional currency cost of goods sold for our Australian subsidiaries. Historically, we have used a combination of zero-cost collars or forward contracts to reduce the exposure. These foreign currency contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes to the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are recorded as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income, if these contracts remain highly effective, and are recognized in net sales or costs of goods sold in the period in which the forecasted transaction affects earnings or are recognized in other (expense) income, net when the transactions are no longer probable of occurring. As of September 30, 2024, we had notional amounts of 136 million Australian dollars 94 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) that expire between October 30, 2024 and December 27, 2024 to reduce the exposure of our Australian subsidiaries cost of sales to fluctuations in currency rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had notional amounts of 915 million South African Rand 53 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) that expire between October 30, 2024 and December 27, 2024 to reduce the exposure of our South African subsidiaries' third party sales to fluctuations in currency rates. At September 30, 2024, there was a net unrealized gain of 6 million recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is expected to be fully recognized in earnings over the next twelve months. There were no corresponding amounts as of December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, there was an unrealized net loss of 4 million recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, which was fully recognized in earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 From time to time, we enter into foreign currency contracts for the South African Rand, Australian Dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling, and Saudi Riyal to reduce exposure of our subsidiaries balance sheet accounts not denominated in our subsidiaries functional currency to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, we have used forward contracts to reduce the exposure. For accounting purposes, these foreign currency contracts are not considered hedges. The change in fair value associated with these contracts is recorded in Other expense, net within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and partially offsets the change in value of third party and intercompany-related receivables not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary. At September 30, 2024, there was (i) 734 billion South African Rand (or approximately 43 million at September 30, 2024 exchange rate), (ii) 254 million Australian dollars (or approximately 176 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate), (iii) 32 million Pound Sterling (or approximately 43 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate), (iv) 12 million Euro (or approximately 13 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate), and (v) 88 million Saudi Riyal (or approximately 24 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) of notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency contracts. At December 31, 2023, there was (i) 837 million South African Rand (or approximately 49 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate), (ii) 153 million Australian dollars (or approximately 106 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate), (iii) 45 million Pound Sterling (or approximately 60 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate), (iv) 45 million Euro (or approximately 50 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) and (v) 67 million Saudi Riyal (or approximately 18 million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) of notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency contracts. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of Tronox s management, including our CEO and CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. Tronox s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Tronox in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Tronox s management, including Tronox s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 
 An evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was also performed to determine whether any changes have occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We are currently undergoing a multi-year IT-enabled transformation program that includes increased automation of both operational and financial systems, including the global enterprise risk management program, through new and upgraded systems, technology and processes. As part of such transformation program, during the third quarter of 2024, we implemented upgrades to our financial systems and platforms in certain regions. The full implementation is expected to occur in phases over a number of years. As the phased implementation of this system occurs, we expect certain changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 While we expect this transformation program to strengthen our internal financial controls, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as processes and procedures in each of the affected areas evolve. 
 
 Other than as discussed above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
