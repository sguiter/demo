 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 There remains significant uncertainty regarding how macroeconomic conditions, including sustained high levels of inflation and higher interest rates, will impact consumer demand. While some of these conditions have negatively impacted consumer discretionary spending behavior, we continue to see strong overall demand for our products. We have, however, seen instances of consumer sensitivity to higher price points, which has negatively impacted our financial results. 
 
 The recent disruptions of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea and surrounding waterways have continued to negatively affect transit times and freight costs for goods manufactured in Asia and destined to Europe, and to a smaller extent the Americas. In addition to these ongoing disruptions, freight rates have remained elevated industry-wide since their increase in the second quarter of 2024. Although such effects have not materially impacted our business to date, the continuation or worsening of these conditions may materially impact our operations and financial results through the remainder of 2024. 
 
 A worsening of any of the macroeconomic trends or uncertainties discussed herein may adversely impact our business, operations, and financial results in the future. We will continue to monitor and, if necessary, strive to mitigate the effects of the macroeconomic environment on our business. 

Product Recall Reserves 
 
 In January 2023, we notified the Consumer Products Safety Commission CPSC of a potential safety concern regarding the magnet-lined closures of our Hopper M30 Soft Cooler, Hopper M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, and SideKick Dry gear case (the affected products and initiated a global stop sale of the affected products. In February 2023, we proposed a voluntary recall of the affected products to the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities. Accordingly, we established reserves for unsalable inventory on-hand, as well as expected future returns, the estimated cost of recall remedies for consumers with affected products, and other recall-related costs as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 In March 2023, we announced separate, voluntary recalls of the affected products in collaboration with the CPSC. During the second quarter of 2023, we began processing recall returns and claims and based on such experience and trends, we reevaluated our assumptions and adjusted our estimated recall expense reserve. As a result, we updated our recall reserve assumptions, which increased the estimated recall expense reserve by 8.5 million during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an immaterial reduction to net sales primarily related to higher recall-related returns, and recorded a benefit in cost of goods sold of 0.8 million, primarily related to lower estimated recall-related costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 24.5 million reduction to net sales primarily related to higher estimated future recall-related gift card elections; recorded a benefit in cost of goods sold of 7.1 million, primarily related to lower estimated costs of future product replacement remedy elections and logistics costs and lower recall-related costs; and recorded a benefit in SG A expenses primarily related to lower estimated other recall-related costs of 10.5 million. The total impact to operating income related to the recalls was a favorable impact of 0.8 million and an unfavorable impact of 6.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 In addition, our 2023 sales were materially adversely impacted by the stop sales of the affected products. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we introduced our redesigned and improved versions of the affected products. 
 
 During 2024, we have not recorded any adjustments to our recall reserves. As a result, the product recall had no impact to our consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 The ultimate impact from the recalls may differ materially from our estimates, and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.

 General 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 
 Net Sales. Net sales are comprised of wholesale channel sales to our retail partners and sales through our DTC channel. Net sales in both channels reflect the impact of product returns as well as discounts for certain sales programs or promotions. 
 
 We discuss the net sales of our products in our two primary categories: Coolers Equipment and Drinkware. Our Coolers Equipment category includes hard coolers, soft coolers, bags, outdoor equipment, and cargo, as well as accessories and replacement parts for these products. Our Drinkware category is primarily composed of our stainless-steel drinkware products and related accessories. In addition, our Other category is primarily comprised of ice substitutes and YETI-branded gear, such as shirts, hats, and other miscellaneous products. 
 
 Gross profit. Gross profit reflects net sales less cost of goods sold, which primarily includes the purchase cost of our products from our third-party contract manufacturers, inbound freight and duties, product quality testing and inspection costs, depreciation expense of our molds, tooling, and equipment, and the cost of customizing products. We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales. Our DTC channel generally generates higher gross margin than our wholesale channel due to differentiated pricing between these channels. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses consist primarily of marketing costs, employee compensation and benefits costs, costs of our outsourced warehousing and logistics operations, costs of operating on third-party DTC marketplaces, professional fees and services, non-cash stock-based compensation, cost of product shipment to our customers, depreciation and amortization expense, and general corporate infrastructure expenses. Our variable expenses, including outbound freight, online marketplace fees, third-party logistics fees, and credit card processing fees, will vary as they are dependent on our sales volume and our channel mix. Our DTC channel variable SG A costs are generally higher as a percentage of net sales than our wholesale channel distribution costs. 
 
 Fiscal Year. We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest in proximity to December 31, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length, except during a 53-week year when the fourth quarter will be 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ending December 28, 2024 2024 is a 52-week period. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2024 ended on March 30, 2024, the second quarter ended on June 29, 2024, and the third quarter ended on September 28, 2024. Our fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 2023 was also a 52-week period. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our fiscal years and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial results presented herein represent the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales increased 44.9 million, or 10 , to 478.4 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 433.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 also include 2.7 million and 6.3 million, respectively, of sales related to gift card redemptions in connection with recall remedies. 
 
 Net sales in our channels were as follows: 
 
 DTC channel net sales increased 21.3 million, or 8 , to 280.8 million, compared to 259.5 million in the prior year quarter, due to growth in both Coolers Equipment and Drinkware. DTC channel mix was 59 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 60 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Wholesale channel net sales increased 23.6 million, or 14 , to 197.6 million, compared to 174.1 million in the same period last year, due to growth in both Drinkware and Coolers Equipment. 
 
 Net sales in our two primary product categories were as follows: 
 
 Drinkware net sales increased by 21.7 million, or 9 , to 275.0 million, compared to 253.3 million in the prior year quarter, driven by the continued expansion and innovation of our Drinkware product offerings and new seasonal colorways. 
 Coolers Equipment net sales increased by 21.0 million, or 12 , to 192.6 million, compared to 171.5 million in the same period last year, driven by strong performance in bags, hard coolers, and outdoor living products. 
 
 Net sales in the U.S. increased 24.5 million, or 7 , to 390.2 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024. Net sales in international locations increased 20.4 million, or 30 , to 88.3 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024. Net sales in international locations represented 18 and 16 of total net sales in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit increased 26.5 million, or 11 , to 277.7 million, compared to 251.3 million in the prior year quarter. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a favorable impact of 0.8 million related to lower than anticipated recall-related costs. Gross margin rate was flat at 58.0 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the following factors: 
 
 lower inbound freight rates, which favorably impacted gross margin by 160 basis points; and 
 lower product costs, which favorably impacted gross margin by 80 basis points; 
 
 21 

Tab le of Contents 

 These were partially offset by: 
 
 higher customization costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 40 basis points; 
 supplier transition costs and higher material costs related to product transitions, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 40 basis points; 
 strategic price decreases on certain hard cooler products implemented during the first quarter of 2024, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 30 basis points; 
 the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in connection with the Mystery Ranch acquisition, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 20 basis points; 
 the absence in the current year quarter of a benefit in the prior year quarter associated with our voluntary product recalls, which drove an unfavorable change in gross margin of 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter; and 
 other impacts, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 90 basis points. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 
 SG A expenses increased 18.7 million, or 10 , to 208.1 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 189.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses decreased 20 basis points to 43.5 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 43.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses was primarily driven by: 
 
 an increase in variable expenses of 0.8 million (decreasing SG A as a percent of net sales by 130 basis points) primarily associated with higher net sales, and comprised of higher distribution costs including higher third-party logistics fees and online marketplace fees, partially offset by lower outbound freight; and 
 an increase in non-variable expenses of 17.9 million (increasing SG A as a percent of net sales by 110 basis points) comprised of higher employee costs, mainly due to investments in headcount to support future growth, and investments in marketing expenses, partially offset by asset impairments in the prior year. 
 
 Non-Operating Expenses 
 
 Interest income, net was 0.4 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024. Interest expense, net was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to an increase in interest income. 
 
 Other income was 4.1 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to other expense of 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to foreign currency gains on intercompany balances for the three months ended September 28, 2024 versus foreign currency losses on intercompany balances for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income tax expense was 17.8 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 24 for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a discrete tax expense related to a change in the estimate for an uncertain tax position in the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 General 
 
 Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital purposes, long-term debt repayments, and capital expenditures. We fund our working capital and our capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand, and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ). Pursuant to our Share Repurchase Program described below, we may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. We believe that our current operating performance, existing cash position, and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs and cash requirements over the next twelve months and foreseeable future. 
 
 Current Liquidity 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had a cash balance of 280.5 million, working capital (excluding cash) of 237.7 million, and 300.0 million of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 Our Credit Facility provides for a 300.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and an 84.4 million term loan Term Loan A ). 
 
 On February 26, 2024, we amended the Credit Facility, leaving the material terms of the Credit Facility substantially unchanged, with the exception of a definitional update and a change to make a Hedging Agreement (as defined in the Credit Facility) entered into in connection with an accelerated share purchase program a permitted Hedging Agreement under the Credit Facility. 
 
 At September 28, 2024, we had 79.1 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan A under the Credit Facility and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or the Alternate Base Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable rate ranging from 1.75 to 2.50 for Term SOFR-based loans and from 0.75 to 1.50 for Alternate Base Rate-based loans, depending upon our total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Additionally, a commitment fee ranging from 0.200 to 0.300 , determined by reference to a pricing grid based on our net leverage ratio, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under Term Loan A was 7.10 during the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 
 The Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants regarding our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. Fluctuations in these ratios may increase our interest expense. Failure to comply with these covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Facility, or the occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness that we may incur in the future. At September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On February 1, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million (exclusive of fees and commissions) of YETI s common stock (the Share Repurchase Program ). The common stock may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, through various methods, including, but not limited to, open market, privately negotiated, or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may also be made pursuant to a plan adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price, and actual amount of share repurchases will be determined by management based on various factors, including, but not limited to, stock price, economic and market conditions, other capital allocation needs and opportunities, and corporate and regulatory considerations. YETI has no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock, and such repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of September 28, 2024, 200 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program.

Tab le of Contents 

 As part of the Share Repurchase Program, on February 27, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC Goldman Sachs to repurchase 100 million of YETI s common stock. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we made a payment of 100 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial share delivery of 1,998,501 shares of our common stock. We received a final delivery of an additional 642,674 shares on April 25, 2024. The ASR resulted in the total repurchase of 2,641,175 shares. See Note 9-Stockholders Equity of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Share Repurchase Program. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 
 Other than as disclosed above, there have been no material changes in our material cash requirements for contractual and other obligations, including capital expenditures, as disclosed under Material Cash Requirements included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC. 

Cash Flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 35,806 114,769 Investing activities (87,047) (58,263) Financing activities (107,517) (11,931) 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on net income, non-cash adjustments to net income, and changes in working capital. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital, partially offset by an increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items for the periods compared. The increase in cash used for working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventory. 
 Investing Activities 
 The increase in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily related to the acquisition of Mystery Ranch and increased purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 
 The increase in cash used by financing activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily driven by repurchases of common stock in connection with our 100 million ASR Agreement.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results is included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC. Other than as described below, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocate the purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their acquisition-date fair values. We use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances that are initially recorded in connection with a business combination. These estimates are reevaluated and adjusted, if needed, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, and are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed that are identified subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in earnings. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures or management of market risk from those disclosed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included under Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations in Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake or fraud. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals or groups of persons or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements in our public reports due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
