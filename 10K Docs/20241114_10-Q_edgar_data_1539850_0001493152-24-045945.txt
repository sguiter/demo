not owned by the Company for an additional of the equity which has been issued. 

On
September 12, 2022, STCB, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Starco Merger Sub Inc. Merger Sub ), completed its acquisition
(the AOS Acquisition of The AOS Group Inc., a Delaware corporation AOS ). The AOS Acquisition consisted
of Merger Sub merging with and into AOS, with AOS being the surviving corporation. AOS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of STCB. 

On
December 29, 2022, STCB, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Starco Merger Sub II. Inc. First Merger Sub completed its
acquisition (the Skylar Acquisition of Skylar Body, Inc. Skylar Inc. ). The Skylar Acquisition consisted
of First Merger Sub merging with and into Skylar Inc. First Merger with Skylar Inc. being the surviving corporation,
and immediately following the First Merger, and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, Skylar Inc. merged with
and into Second Merger Sub (the Second Merger with the Second Merger Sub being the surviving entity Skylar Body, LLC Skylar ).
Skylar is a wholly-owned subsidiary of STCB. 

On
February 15, 2023, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Starco Merger Sub I, Inc. Starco Merger Sub I ), completed
its acquisition (the Soylent Acquisition of Soylent Nutrition, Inc., a Delaware corporation Soylent ). The
Soylent Acquisition consisted of Starco Merger Sub I merging with and into Soylent, with Soylent being the surviving corporation. Soylent
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of STCB. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are of STCB and its subsidiaries AOS, Skylar, Soylent, Whipshots Holdings and its wholly
owned subsidiary Whipshots LLC (collectively, the Company ). 

On
January 3, 2023, the Board of the Company approved the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Starco Brands,
Inc. (the Amended and Restated Articles). On January 6, 2023, the stockholders of the Company representing of the Company s
outstanding common stock adopted the Amended and Restated Articles. On February 9, 2023, the Company filed the Amended and Restated Articles,
which, among other things, (i) increased the authorized shares of common stock, par value per share, from shares (the
 Old Common Stock to shares, (ii) established two classes of Common Stock, consisting of (y) 
shares of Class A common stock, par value per share Class A common stock ), and (z) shares of Class
B common stock, par value per share and (iii) reclassified all issued, outstanding or authorized Old Common Stock of the Company
into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As a result, following the filing of the Amended and Restated Articles with the Nevada
Secretary of State, the Company s prior common stock was renamed Class A common stock on its trading symbol. 

at September 30, 2024, which includes the impact of its net losses of and
 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and total debt on the balance sheet of as of September
30, 2024, with a small portion of the debt coming due within one year of the date of the financial statements being issued. Management
evaluated the principal conditions that initially give rise to the substantial doubt and note that the historical net losses and accumulated
deficit impact are justified as they are primarily made up of non-cash expenses or one-time non-recurring expenses, such as goodwill
impairment, stock-based compensation expense, fair value share adjustment loss and acquisition transaction expenses. Total debt of 
on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 includes of notes payable to Ross Sklar Sklar ), who has a large
minority ownership of the Company that provides incentive for Mr. Sklar to extend or refinance the notes before the notes become due,
as seen historically (see Note 8). Management plans include (i) continuing to increase net cash provided by operating activities, which
was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while decreasing net cash provided by financing activities, and (ii) obtaining
an alternative financing source to pay off all current debt outstanding and to provide additional working capital, if needed. To achieve
these objectives, management has proposed and approved plans to increase top line revenue for each segment while decreasing overall expenses
as a percentage of revenue, as a result of realizing synergies from the acquisitions of AOS, Skylar and Soylent, and utilizing the Company s
back-end shared service model to reduce expenses. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company
do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of the aforementioned uncertainties.

The
Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates include the timing for revenue recognition, testing goodwill
for impairment, recoverability of long-lived assets, income taxes and related valuation allowances, fair value of contributed services,
and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend
rate.

Pursuant
to the Soylent Acquisition, the Company may be required to issue the Share Adjustment (as defined in Note 5) to the former owners of
Soylent based upon the stock price of the Company on the Adjustment Date (as defined in Note 5). The Company engaged a third-party valuation
firm to estimate the fair value of this contingent liability by performing a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast the value of the Company s
stock and the implied value of the Share Adjustment. See NOTE 5 ACQUISITIONS for further discussion. The fair value of the share
adjustment on the Soylent Acquisition date was . The inputs to estimate the fair value of the share adjustment were the market
price of the Company s common stock, the option expected term, the volatility of the Company s common stock price and the
risk-free interest rate. Significant changes to any unobservable input may result in a significant change in the fair value measurement.

or greater are capitalized.
Depreciation is computed using straight-line over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures that enhance the useful
lives of the assets are capitalized and depreciated. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise
disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations. 

Whipshots
Holdings, an owned subsidiary, earns its revenues as royalties from the licensing agreements it has with Temperance, a related entity.
STCB licenses the right for Temperance to manufacture and sell vodka infused whipped cream. The amount of the licensing revenue received
varies depending upon the product and the royalty percentage is based on contractual terms. The Company recognizes its revenue under
these licensing agreements only when sales are made by Temperance to a third party. 

The
Company applies the requirements of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which includes the following five-step model
in order to determine the recognition of revenue: (i) Identify the contract with a customer; (ii) Identify the performance obligation
in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction
price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the licensee transferring goods or services to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope
of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company s licensee
must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction
price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied.
Generally, the Company s licensee s performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon
delivery.

Indefinite-lived
intangible assets consist of certain trademarks and formula lists. These intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment
annually or whenever impairment indicators exist. 

The
Company assesses potential impairment of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset or
asset group s carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review
include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast
that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. Other factors
include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend. This evaluation
is performed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related
assets. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized, measured by the difference
between the carrying value, and the estimated fair value of the assets, with such estimated fair values determined using the best information
available and in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Company did not record asset impairment charges related to its intangible assets. 

Our
contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability
at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor. When performance remains with the licensor, we record guarantee
payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution
of the contract. 

Each
quarter, we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty-based assets, as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments
not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through future revenue. Impairments or losses determined post-launch
are charged to cost of revenue. We evaluate long-lived royalty-based assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment
indicators exist. If an impairment exists, then the related assets are written down to fair value. Unrecognized minimum royalty-based
commitments are accounted for as executory contracts, and therefore, any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying

Goodwill
as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. 

We
review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Our goodwill impairment test may
require the use of qualitative judgements and fair-value techniques, which are inherently subjective. Impairment loss, if any, is recorded
when the fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying value. 

No 
impairment losses related to goodwill were recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023 goodwill was and , respectively.

Agreement. 

The
Loan and Security Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit in the amount not to exceed million at any one time, or the
Revolving Loan Commitment Amount in return for a first priority security interest in the Collateral. The Revolving Commitment Amount

the first day of each month thereafter. The aggregate principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed
the Revolving Loan Availability, which is equal to the lesser of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount or the Borrowing Base Amount; if
the aggregate principal balance does exceed the availability, the Company shall immediately make a repayment to eliminate such excess.
The Revolving Line matures on May 24, 2026, and such Maturity Date will be automatically extended for one (1) year, subject to the satisfaction
of certain terms and conditions described in the Loan and Security Agreement. 

Each
Revolving Loan advanced under the Revolving Loan Commitment bears interest at a rate per annum equal to One Month Term SOFR plus the
Applicable Margin. If a Revolving Loan or any portion thereof is considered a part of the Permitted Overadvance Amount under the Loan
and Security Agreement, the Applicable Margin for such loan shall be increased by an additional two percent per annum. Revolving
Loans may be repaid at any time and reborrowed up to, but not including the Maturity Date. On the Maturity Date, the outstanding aggregate
principal balance of all Revolving Loans shall be due and payable. The interest rate for the revolving loan was as of September
30, 2024. 

Accrued
and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Loans shall be due and payable commencing on June 1, 2024 and on
the first date of each calendar month thereafter. All accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable on the maturity date. 

Subject
to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions described in the Loan and Security Agreement, the Borrowers may request to increase
the Revolving Loan Commitment by an aggregate amount not less than million not exceeding million. Such request may be accepted
by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion. 

The
Loan and Security Agreement contains customary limitations, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes to business
or organizational structure, investments, loans, advances, guarantees, and acquisitions, asset sales, dividends, stock repurchases, stock
redemptions, and the redemption, payment or prepayment of other debt, and transactions with affiliates. We are also subject to financial
covenants, including a minimum EBITDA covenant and a maximum Unfinanced Capital Expenditures covenant. 

The
Loan and Security Agreement also contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts
when due, violation of covenants, breaches of representations or warranties, cross defaults, change of control, insolvency, bankruptcy
events, and material judgments. Some of these events of default allow for grace periods or are qualified by materiality concepts. Upon
the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement may be accelerated and become
due and payable immediately. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants relating to the agreement

Broker

Competition 

The
household, personal care and beverage consumer products market in the U.S. is mature and highly competitive. Our competitive set has
grown with our recent acquisitions and consists of consumer products companies, including large and well-established multinational companies
as well as smaller regional and local companies. These competitors include Johnson Johnson, The Procter Gamble Company, Unilever,
Diageo, CytoSport, Inc., Abbott Nutrition, Nestl , Owyn, Clean Reserve, The 7 Virtues and others. Within each product category,
most of our products compete with other widely advertised brands and store brand products. 

Competition
in our product categories is based on a number of factors including price, quality and brand recognition. We benefit from the strength
of our brands, a differentiated portfolio of quality branded and store brand products, as well as significant capital investment in our
manufacturing facilities. We believe the strong recognition of the Whipshots and Soylent brands among U.S. consumers, along
with the growing brand recognition of Skylar , gives us a competitive advantage. 

Growth
Strategy 

As
long as the Company can raise capital, the Company plans to launch other products in spray foods and condiments, over the counter respiratory,
air care, skin care, sun care, hair care, personal care, pain management, performance supplements, plant-based convenience shakes, powders
and bars, apparel, fragrances, spirits and beverages over the next 36 months. Financing growth and launching of new products through
our key subsidiaries is key to the Company s ability to raise further capital. 

We
will need to rely on sales of our Class A common stock and other sources of financing to raise additional capital. The purchasers and
manner of any share issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. This provides significant support for our current retail and online distribution. We also plan to raise capital
in the future through a compliant offering. 

We
continue to strive towards becoming a leading brand owner and third-party marketer of cutting edge technologies in the consumer products
marketplace whose success is expected to increase stockholder value. The Company will continue to evaluate this and other opportunities
to further set its strategy for 2024 and beyond.

Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenues of 14,006,349 compared to 15,209,504 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a decrease of 1,203,155 or 8 . The decrease in the current period was primarily due to a
decrease in Soylent revenue driven by a product category realignment at a major retail customer. This reduction was partially offset by increases
in sales for Winona and Art of Sport 

Revenues,
related parties 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded related party revenues of 1,480,007 compared to 2,463,542 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a decrease of 983,535 or 40 . The decrease in the current period was largely driven by
lower Whipshots sales due to industry destocking and lower levels of new retailer loading. 

Operating
Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, compensation expenses increased 373,424, or 21 , to 2,185,256 from 1,811,832 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023; the increase is a result of converting a portion of independent contractors to full-time employees. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 434,698 in professional fees compared to 1,380,680 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, for a decrease of 945,982, or 69 . Professional fees are mainly for contractors, accounting,
auditing and legal services associated with business operations, merger activity, and our quarterly filings as a public company, and
advisory and valuation services. The decrease is primarily due to reduced legal and audit-related expenses in the current year
period compared to expenses related to the acquisitions of Soylent, Skylar, and AOS in the prior year
period. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 4,236,433 in marketing, general and administrative expense as
compared to 4,955,578 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, for a decrease of 719,145 or 15 , which was largely driven by reduced marketing spend and a focus on operational efficiencies. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a fair value share adjustment loss of 5,105,535; such was due to an
increase in the fair value of the Soylent Shareholders rights to potentially receive additional Starco shares, increasing from 0.235
per share as of June 30, 2024 to 0.253 per share as of September 30, 2024. 

Other
Income and Expense 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had total other expense, of 681,573 compared to total other expense, net 
of 376,847 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had interest
expense and other expense of 303,155 and 378,418, respectively, compared to interest expense and other expense of 255,775 and
 121,072, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
(Loss) Income 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of 6,257,088 as compared to net income of 2,361,251
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss is primarily due to a loss on the change in fair value of
the stock payable for shares due to Soylent Stockholders, in addition to increases in expenses from the acquired businesses AOS,
Skylar and Soylent.

Revenues 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenues of 41,8 16,348 
compared to 38,124,740 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for an increase of 3,69 1,608 
or 10 ; the increase in the current period was largely due to recognition of a full nine months of revenue from Soylent in the current period
versus only seven and a half months of sales from Soylent in the prior period, as the Company acquired Soylent in February
2023. This increase in Soylent revenue was augmented by growth in sales of Winona. 

Revenues,
related parties 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded related party revenues of 4,731,430 compared to 8,201,377 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a decrease of 3,469,947 or 42 . The decrease in the current period was largely driven
by reduced sales of Whipshots. 

Operating
Expenses 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compensation expense increased 1,910,511, or 36 , to 7,195,932 from 5,285,421 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023; the increase is a result of converting a portion of independent contractors to full-time employees in
the current period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 2,771,608 in professional fees compared to 4,177,424 in the prior
period for a decrease of 1,405,816, or 34 . Professional fees are mainly for contractors, accounting, auditing and legal services
associated with business operations, merger activity, and our quarterly filings as a public company, and advisory and valuation
services. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to a
decrease in expenses (contractor fees, legal, and audit fees) in the current year period compared to expenses related to the
acquisitions of Soylent, Skylar, and AOS in the prior year period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 14,073,064 in marketing, general and administrative expense compared to
 12,947,530 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for an increase of 1,125,714, or 9 . The increase can be attributed to the
addition of the acquired businesses and an increase in spending on marketing and increased amortization expense. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a fair value share adjustment loss of 15,703,049. This was due to an
increase in the fair value of the Soylent sellers rights to potentially receive additional Starco shares, increasing from 0.136
per share as of December 31, 2023 to 0.253 per share as of September 30, 2024. 

Other
Income and Expense 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had total other expense, net of 1,45 1,060 compared to total other expense, net of 405,487 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had interest expense and other expense
of 711,304 and 739,756, respectively, compared to interest expense and other income of 617,289 and 211,802, respectively, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Income (Loss) 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of 22,090,177 compared to a net loss of 5,252,742 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss is primarily due to a loss on the change in fair value of the stock payable
for shares due to Soylent Stockholders, in addition to increases in expenses from the acquired businesses AOS, Skylar and Soylent.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately 86.1
million at September 30, 2024. Our net cash used in financing activities was 377,101 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due
primarily to payments toward i) lines of credit, ii) a revolving loan, iii) notes payable and iv) loans from related parties of approximately
 23.5 million, offset by proceeds from a revolving loan and a note payable of approximately 23.2 million. This compared to 535,974
in cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to approximately 0.8 million of
loan advances from Ross Sklar, which was partially offset by net payments on the line of credit and repurchases of common stock totaling
approximately 250,000. 

Our
net cash provided by operating activities was 517,87 9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 totaling 39,743,653 include items such as marketing and administrative costs, consultant compensation,
insurance, legal and other professional fees, compliance, website maintenance and loss on share fair value adjustment. 

On
January 24, 2020, STCB executed a promissory note for 100,000 with Sklar. The note bore interest at 4 per annum, compounded monthly,
was unsecured, and matured two years from the original date of issuance. This loan was subsequently amended to mature on July 19, 2023.
On June 28, 2021, STCB executed an additional promissory note with Sklar in the principal amount of 100,000 with the same terms as the
January 24, 2020 note and a maturity date of June 28, 2023. On September 17, 2021, STCB executed a third promissory note with Sklar in
the principal amount of 500,000 with the same terms as the prior notes and a maturity date of September 17, 2023. On December 13, 2021,
STCB executed a fourth promissory note with Sklar in the principal amount of 500,000 with the same terms as the prior notes and a maturity
date of December 12, 2023. On February 14, 2022, STCB executed a fifth promissory note with Sklar in the principal amount of 472,500
with the same terms as the prior notes and a maturity date of February 14, 2024. This note is also convertible into the Class A common
stock at Sklar s option with a conversion price of 0.29 per share. On May 10, 2024, the maturity date of this note was extended
to December 31, 2024. On December 29, 2022, STCB executed a sixth promissory note with Sklar in the principal amount of 2,000,000. This
note bore interest at Prime + 4 per annum, compounds monthly, is secured, matures on August 1, 2023, and included warrants to purchase
285,714 shares of our common stock at a price of 0.01 per share. On March 3, 2023, STCB executed a seventh promissory note with Sklar
in the principal amount of 800,000. This note bore interest at Prime + 4 per annum, compounds monthly, is secured, matures on July
1, 2023, and included warrants to purchase 114,286 shares of our common stock at a price of 0.01 per share. 

On
August 11, 2023, the Company issued to Sklar a consolidated secured promissory note (the Consolidated Secured Promissory Note in the principal sum of 4,000,000, with a maturity date of December 31, 2024. The Consolidated Secured Promissory Note carries a floating
interest rate comprised of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (re-assessed on the first date of each month (plus 2 ), and is secured
by an amended and restated consolidated security agreement (the Amended and Restated Consolidated Security Agreement ),
by and between the Company and Sklar, dated August 11, 2023, The Consolidated Secured Promissory Note consolidated the outstanding loan
obligations of the Company to Sklar evidenced pursuant to (i) the January 24, 2020 Amended Note, (ii) the June 28, 2021 Note, (iii) the
September 17, 2021 Note, (iv) the December 13, 2021 Note, (v) the December 29, 2022 Note, and (vi) the March 3, 2023 Note, as summarized
in the table below. The Amended and Restated Consolidated Security Agreement merged and integrated the December 29, 2022 Security Agreement
and the March 3, 2023 Security Agreement, and provides a security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Amended and Restated
Consolidated Security Agreement) to secure the repayment of all principal, interest, costs, expenses and other amounts then or thereafter
due under the Consolidated Secured Promissory Note until by the maturity date. Sklar was authorized to file financing statements to perfect
the security interest in the Collateral without authentication by the Company. The following table represents Prior Notes that were part

 Note
that 1,527,500 of this total was repaid to Mr. Sklar from proceeds under the Gibraltar Loan. 

The
restructuring is accounted for as a debt modification. On May 31, 2024, the Consolidated Secured Promissory Note was amended by that
certain Amendment to Consolidated Secure Promissory Note, by and between STCB and Mr. Sklar, dated May 31, 2024 (the 2024 Consolidated
Note Amendment and together with the Consolidated Secured Promissory Note, the Amended Consolidated Secured Promissory
Note ). The 2024 Consolidated Note Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date to August 31, 2026, provided that
to the extent amounts remain due and payable on the maturity date, it will be extended until August 31, 2027. 

The
Company also issued a February 14, 2022 Note to Sklar in the principal amount of 472,500 that was not included in the note consolidation.
On May 10, 2024, the Company and Sklar entered into an amendment to the February 14, 2022 Note to extend the maturity date of the February
14, 2022 Note to December 31, 2024. The February 14, 2022 Note bore interest at 4 per annum, was unsecured, and was to mature two years
from the original date of issuance. This note may also convert into shares of Company common stock at the 10-day volume weighted average
trading price of the Company common stock for the 10-day period prior to the issuance of the Note, which was calculated as 0.29 per
share. The February 14, 2022 Note has been repaid in full and the Company has no further obligations under such note. 

Additionally,
on May 24, 2024, the Company entered into the Loan and Security Agreement, which allowed the Company to reduce long-term debt and expand
its access to working capital (see Note 6). In connection with the Loan and Security Agreement, the Lender required Mr. Sklar to enter
into a subordination agreement pursuant to which Mr. Sklar s rights under (i) the February 14, 2022 Note, as amended and (ii) the
Consolidated Secured Promissory Note would be subordinated to the lender s rights under the Loan and Security Agreement. 

In
exchange for the subordination of and the maturity extension reflected in the Amended Consolidated Secured Promissory Note, 2,000,000
of the revolving loan available cash under the Loan and Security Agreement was used to repay the February 14, 2022 Note in its entirety
and to pay down the interest and a portion of principal balance on the Amended Consolidated Secured Promissory Note. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal due to Mr. Sklar under outstanding notes was 2,472,500 and 4,472,500, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no accrued interest due on these notes.

On
May 24, 2024, (i) Starco Brands, Inc., a Nevada corporation Starco or the Company ), (ii) and
each of Starco s subsidiaries, Whipshots Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Whipshots Holdings ),
Whipshots, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company Whipshots ), The AOS Group Inc., a Delaware corporation AOS
Group ), Skylar Body, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Skylar ), Soylent Nutrition, Inc., a Delaware
corporation Soylent and together with Starco, Whipshots Holdings, Whipshots, AOS Group, Skylar, each individually,
a Borrower and collectively, the Borrowers ), and (iii) Gibraltar Business Capital, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the Lender entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan and Security
Agreement ), allowing Starco Brands to reduce a portion of its long term debt (including retiring the Soylent Revolver) and
expand its access to working capital. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined will have the meanings set forth in the Loan and Security
Agreement. 

The
Loan and Security Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit in the amount not to exceed 12.5 million at any one time, or the
Revolving Loan Commitment Amount in return for a first priority security interest in the Collateral. The Revolving Commitment Amount
is supplemented by a Permitted Overadvance Amount of 1.5 million. The first 1.5 million in Revolving Loans drawn on this line will
be considered permitted overadvances, and the Permitted Overadvance Amount shall be reduced by 125,000 beginning on June 1, 2024, and
the first day of each month thereafter. The aggregate principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed
the Revolving Loan Availability, which is equal to the lesser of the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount or the Borrowing Base Amount; if
the aggregate principal balance does exceed the availability, the Company shall immediately make a repayment to eliminate such excess.
The Revolving Line matures on May 24, 2026, and such Maturity Date will be automatically extended for one (1) year, subject to the satisfaction
of certain terms and conditions described in the Loan and Security Agreement. 

Each
Revolving Loan advanced under the Revolving Loan Commitment bears interest at a rate per annum equal to One Month Term SOFR plus the
Applicable Margin. If a Revolving Loan or any portion thereof is considered a part of the Permitted Overadvance Amount under the
Loan and Security Agreement, the Applicable Margin for such loan shall be increased by an additional two percent (2.00 per annum.
Revolving Loans may be repaid at any time and reborrowed up to, but not including the Maturity Date. On the Maturity Date, the
outstanding aggregate principal balance of all Revolving Loans shall be due and payable. The interest rate for the revolving loan
was 10.00 as of September 30, 2024. 

Accrued
and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Loans shall be due and payable commencing on June 1, 2024 and on
the first date of each calendar month thereafter. All accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable on the maturity date. 

Subject
to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions described in the Loan and Security Agreement, the Borrowers may request to increase
the Revolving Loan Commitment by an aggregate amount not less than 1 million not exceeding 2.5 million. Such request may be accepted
by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion. 

The
Loan and Security Agreement contains customary limitations, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes to business
or organizational structure, investments, loans, advances, guarantees, and acquisitions, asset sales, dividends, stock repurchases, stock
redemptions, and the redemption, payment or prepayment of other debt, and transactions with affiliates. We are also subject to financial
covenants, including a minimum EBITDA covenant and a maximum Unfinanced Capital Expenditures. 

The
Loan and Security Agreement also contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts
when due, violation of covenants, breaches of representations or warranties, cross defaults, change of control, insolvency, bankruptcy
events, and material judgments. Some of these events of default allow for grace periods or are qualified by materiality concepts. Upon
the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement may be accelerated and become
due and payable immediately. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants relating to the agreement
and the available borrowing amount was approximately 5.8 million.

Going
Concern 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company
identified that a substantial doubt exists related to the Company s ability to meet its obligations as they become due within one
year of the date of the financial statements being issued. Principal conditions that gave rise to this substantial doubt include historical
net losses as indicated by the Company s accumulated deficit of approximately 86,100,000 at September 30, 2024, which includes
the impact of its net losses of 6,527,088 and 22,090,177 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and total debt on
the balance sheet of 8,808,010 as of September 30, 2024, with a small portion of the debt coming due within one year of the date of
the financial statements being issued. Management evaluated the principal conditions that initially give rise to the substantial doubt
and note that the historical net losses and accumulated deficit impact are justified as they are primarily made up of non-cash expenses
or one-time non-recurring expenses, such as goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation expense, fair value share adjustment loss and
acquisition transaction expenses. Total debt of 8,080,010 on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 includes 2,472,500 of notes
payable to Ross Sklar Sklar ), who has a large minority ownership of the Company that provides incentive for Mr. Sklar
to extend or refinance the notes before the notes become due, as seen historically (see Note 8). Management plans include (i) continuing
to increase net cash provided by operating activities, which was 517,879 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while decreasing
net cash provided by financing activities, and (ii) obtaining an alternative financing source to pay off all current debt outstanding
and to provide additional working capital, if needed. To achieve these objectives, management has proposed and approved plans to increase
top line revenue for each segment while decreasing overall expenses as a percentage of revenue, as a result of realizing synergies from
the acquisitions of AOS, Skylar and Soylent, and utilizing the Company s back-end shared service model to reduce expenses. These
conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from
the outcome of the aforementioned uncertainties.

stayed relatively constant, which is primarily a result of an increase in accounts payable and other payables and accrued liabilities
of approximately 5.7 million and 1.0 million, respectively, offset by decreases in notes payables, lines of credit and the fair value
of share adjustment account of approximately 2.0 million, 3.8 million and 1.4 million, respectively.

by proceeds from a revolving loan and a note payable of approximately 23.2 million. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 535,974, which primarily
includes 800,000 of loan advances from Ross Sklar, which was partially offset by net payments on the line of credit of 136,500 and 98,550
of repurchases of common stock. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Effects
of Inflation 

Inflationary
factors such as increases in the costs to acquire goods and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do
not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation
in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of revenues if the selling prices of our services do not increase with these increased costs. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
costs, expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on historical experience and judgements that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made. However, all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain
and unpredictable, and actual results may differ. It is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgement to the same facts
and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that could result in material changes to our operating
results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. 

We
consider our critical accounting estimates to include the assumptions and estimates associated with timing for revenue recognition, testing
goodwill for impairment, recoverability of long-lived assets, income taxes, fair value of contributed services, and assumptions used
in the Black-Scholes valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend rate. Our significant
accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the following
accounting policies and estimates are critical to our business operations and understanding our financial results. 

Acquisition
Accounting 

We
account for acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to ASC 805, Business Combinations . Accordingly,
for each acquisition, we record the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and recognize
the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. For each acquisition, the fair value
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined based on assumptions that reasonable market participants would use to value
the assets in the principal (or most advantageous) market. 

35 

In
determining the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions, management engages third-party
valuation experts. Management is responsible for these internal and third-party valuations and appraisals. 

Revenue
Recognition 

STCB,
excluding its subsidiaries, earns a majority of its revenues through the sale of food products, primarily through Winona. Revenue from
retail sales is recognized at shipment to the retailer. 

AOS,
one of STCB s wholly owned subsidiaries, earns its revenues through the sale of premium body and skincare products. Revenue from
retail sales is recognized at shipment to the retailer. Revenue from eCommerce sales, including Amazon Fulfillment by Amazon Amazon
FBA ), is recognized upon shipment of merchandise or FOB destination. 

Skylar,
one of STCB s wholly owned subsidiaries, earns its revenues through the sale of fragrances. Revenue from retail sales is recognized
at shipment to the retailer. Revenue from eCommerce sales, including Amazon FBA, is recognized either upon shipment of merchandise or
FOB destination. 

Soylent,
one of STCB s wholly owned subsidiaries, earns its revenues through the sale of nutritional drinks. Revenue from retail sales is
recognized at shipment to the retailer. Revenue from eCommerce sales, is recognized upon shipment of merchandise. 

Whipshots
Holdings, an 85 owned subsidiary, earns its revenues as royalties from the licensing agreements it has with Temperance, a related entity.
STCB licenses the right for Temperance to manufacture and sell vodka infused whipped cream. The amount of the licensing revenue received
varies depending upon the product and the royalty percentage is based on contractual terms. The Company recognizes its revenue under
these licensing agreements only when sales are made by Temperance to a third party. 

The
Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract;
(ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the
contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction
price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

The
Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled
to in exchange for the licensee transferring goods or services to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope
of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company s licensee
must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction
price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied.
Generally, the Company s licensee s performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon
delivery. 

Goodwill
Impairment 

Goodwill
as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. 

We
review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Our goodwill impairment test may
require the use of qualitative judgements and fair-value techniques, which are inherently subjective. Impairment loss, if any, is recorded
when the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value for each reporting unit. 

No
impairment losses related to goodwill were recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

36 

Recoverability
of Long-Lived Assets 

We
review intangible assets, property, equipment and software with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate.
If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset
or group of assets exceeds its fair value. Significant estimates include but are not limited to future expected cash flows, replacement
cost and discount rates. There were no impairment losses related to long-lived assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements
or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and
tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Section 740-10-25 with regards to uncertainty
income taxes. Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return
should be recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements
from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50 likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties
on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities
for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the condensed consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other
new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer,
we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) and through the COSO 2013 framework as of the end of the period covered by this report. The disclosure controls and procedures
ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that,
as of September 30, 2024, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley, is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
interim condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
ineffectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses: 

Lack of an audit committee 

Lack of corporate documentation 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
