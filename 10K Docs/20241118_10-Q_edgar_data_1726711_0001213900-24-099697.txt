CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
AND INDUSTRY DATA 

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). These statements may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as may, should, expects, 
 intends, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, 
 potential, continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Our forward-looking statements
are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our company, are not guarantees of future results
or performance and involve substantial risks and uncertainty. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed
in these forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed
in these forward-looking statements. Our business and our forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties,
including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements regarding: 

we have generated no significant
revenue from commercial sales to date and our future profitability is uncertain; 

if we fail to obtain the capital
necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue or complete our product development and you will likely lose your entire
investment; 

our financial situation creates
doubt whether we will continue as a going concern; 

we may need to raise additional
funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all; 

even if we can raise additional
funding, we may be required to do so on terms that are dilutive to you.; 

the regulatory approval process
is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of our future product
candidates, if any; 

we may encounter substantial
delays in completing our clinical studies which in turn will require additional costs, or we may fail to demonstrate adequate safety
and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities; 

if our future pre-clinical
development and future clinical Phase I/II studies are unsuccessful, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize,
our product candidates on a timely basis or at all; 

even if we receive regulatory
approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate
from their sales, if any, may be limited; 

adverse events involving our
products may lead the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency to delay or deny clearance for our products or result in product recalls
that could harm our reputation, business and financial results; 

ii 

certain technologies are subject
to licenses from LLU and Stanford (as defined below), each of which are revocable in certain circumstances, including in the event we
do not achieve certain payments and milestone deadlines. Without these licenses, we may not be able to continue to develop our product
candidates; 

if we were to lose our CLIA
certification or state laboratory licenses, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able
to offer our assays (including our AditxtScore platform), which would limit our revenues and harm our business. If we were to
lose, or fail to obtain, a license in any other state where we are required to hold a license, we would not be able to test specimens
from those states; 

our results of operations will
be affected by the level of royalty and milestone payments that we are required to pay to third parties; 

we face substantial competition,
which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do; 

our technologies and products
under development, and our business, may fail if we are not able to successfully commercialize them and ultimately generate significant
revenues as a result; 

customers may not adopt our
products quickly, or at all; 

the failure to obtain or maintain
patents, licensing agreements and other intellectual property could materially impact our ability to compete effectively; 

some of our intellectual property
may be subject to march-in rights by the U.S. federal government; 

we do not expect to pay dividends
in the foreseeable future; 

we have issued a significant
number of shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants and may continue to do so in the future. The conversion and/or exercise
of these securities and the sale of the shares of common stock issuable thereunder may dilute your percentage ownership interest and
may also result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock; 

we have issued a significant
number of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, options and warrants and may continue to do so in the future. The vesting
and, if applicable, exercise of these securities and the sale of the shares of common stock issuable thereunder may dilute your percentage
ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock; 

we have entered into a Common
Stock Purchase Agreement with an equity line investor pursuant to which we may issue and sell up to 150 million of our common stock,
which could result in significant dilution; 

we have entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC pursuant to which we may issue and sell up to 35 million of our common stock, which could result in significant dilution; 

while we have entered into
a Share Exchange Agreement with Cellvera Global, a Merger Agreement with Evofem Biosciences, Inc. and an Arrangement Agreement with Appili
Therapeutics, Inc., we cannot assure you that such transactions will be consummated or, that if one or more of such transactions are
consummated, that they will be accretive to stockholder value; 

iii 

we may engage in future acquisitions
or strategic transactions, including the transactions with Cellvera Global, Evofem Biosciences and Appili Therapeutics, which will require
us to seek additional financing or financial commitments, increase our expenses and/or present significant distractions to our management; 

future sales or issuances of
substantial amounts of our common stock, including, potentially as a result of future acquisitions or strategic transactions, including
the transactions with Evofem Biosciences, Appili Therapeutics, and Cellvera Global, could result in significant dilution; 

On December 29, 2023, we received the determination from Nasdaq that we regained compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, however, we remain subject to a panel monitor of our ongoing compliance until December 29, 2024 and if we fail to comply with such requirements during the panel monitor, it could result in the delisting of our securities by Nasdaq; and 

exclusive forum provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. 

All of our forward-looking
statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q only. In each case, actual results may differ materially from such
forward-looking information. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. An
occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic reports or other documents or filings filed with
or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC could materially and adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Except as required by law, we do not undertake or plan to update or revise
any such forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or projections or other circumstances
affecting such forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, even if such results, changes,
or circumstances make it clear that any forward-looking information will not be realized. Any public statements or disclosures by us following
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q may include market data and certain industry data and forecasts, which we may obtain from internal company surveys, market research,
consultant surveys, publicly available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications, articles, and surveys.
Industry surveys, publications, consultant surveys, and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained
from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. While we believe that such
studies and publications are reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources.

Report on Form 10-Q, the Company, Aditxt, we, us, and our refers

Risks and Uncertainties 

The Company has a limited operating history and
is in the very early stages of generating revenue from intended operations. The Company s business and operations are sensitive
to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide along with local, state, and federal governmental policy decisions.
A host of factors beyond the Company s control could cause fluctuations in these conditions. Adverse conditions may include: changes
in the biotechnology regulatory environment, technological advances that render our technologies obsolete, availability of resources for
clinical trials, acceptance of technologies into the medical community, and competition from larger, more well-funded companies. These
adverse conditions could affect the Company s financial condition and the results of its operations. 

and negative cash flow from operating activities of . As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash balance
was . 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company was subject to the offering limits
in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 (the Baby Shelf Limitation ). Thus, the maximum amount of securities that the Company
could offer and sell under its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 as of September 30, 2024 was approximately million. Upon
the filing of the Company s annual report on Form 10-K on April 16, 2024, the Company s aggregate market value of the voting
and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates was below million. As a result, the maximum amount that the Company can sell under
its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 during any 12 month period is equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of the voting
and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates of the Company. 

On November 21, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq
that it had regained compliance with the Public Float Rule. On December 29, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq that
it had regained compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule but will be subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one
year. See Risk Factors and Note 12 for additional details regarding Nasdaq
compliance. 

If we are delisted from Nasdaq, but obtain a substitute
listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility
than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on any such substitute market in the quantities,
at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our
common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of our common stock, warrants and pre-funded warrants would likely be significantly
adversely affected. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations
and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and related
notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
or SEC. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties,
and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain
factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, including those factors set forth in the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and
Industry Data and in the section entitled Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A. 

Overview and Mission 

We believe the world needs and
deserves a new approach to innovating that harnesses the power of large groups of stakeholders who work together to ensure that
the most promising innovations make it into the hands of people who need them most. 

We were incorporated in the
State of Delaware on September 28, 2017, and our headquarters are in Mountain View, California. The Company was founded with a mission
of bringing stakeholders together, to transform promising innovations into products and services that could address some of the most challenging
needs. The socialization of innovation through engaging stakeholders in every aspect of it, is key to transforming more innovations, more
rapidly, and more efficiently. 

At inception, the first innovation
we took on was an immune modulation technology titled ADI/Adimune with a focus on prolonging life and enhancing life quality of patients
that have undergone organ transplants. Since then, we expanded our portfolio of innovations, and we continue to evaluate a variety of
promising health innovations. 

ADIMUNE, INC. 

Formed in January 2023, Adimune ,
Inc. Adimune is focused on leading our immune modulation therapeutic programs. Adimune s proprietary immune modulation
product candidate, ADI-100 , based on the Apoptotic DNA Immunotherapy platform technology, utilizes a novel approach that
mimics the way our bodies naturally induce tolerance to our own tissues. It includes two DNA molecules designed to deliver signals to
induce tolerance. ADI-100 has been successfully tested in several preclinical models (e.g., skin grafting, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes,
multiple sclerosis). 

In May 2023, Adimune entered
into a clinical trial agreement with Mayo Clinic to advance clinical studies targeting autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system CNS with the initial focus on the rare, but debilitating, autoimmune disease Stiff Person Syndrome SPS ).
According to the National Organization of Rare Diseases, the exact incidence and prevalence of SPS is unknown; however, one estimate places
the incidence at approximately one in one million individuals in the general population. 

Pending approval by the International
Review Board, a human trial for SPS is expected get underway in the first half of 2025 with enrollment of up to 20 patients, some of whom
may also have type 1 diabetes. ADI-100 will initially be tested for safety and efficacy. ADI-100 is designed to tolerize against an antigen
known as glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD ), which is implicated in type-1 diabetes, psoriasis, stiff person syndrome, and
in many autoimmune diseases of the CNS.

Background 

The discovery of immunosuppressive
(anti-rejection and monoclonal) drugs over 40 years ago has made possible life-saving organ transplantation procedures and blocking of
unwanted immune responses in autoimmune diseases. However, immune suppression leads to significant undesirable side effects, such as increased
susceptibility to life-threatening infections and cancers, because it indiscriminately and broadly suppresses immune function throughout
the body. While the use of these drugs has been justifiable because they prevent or delay organ rejection, their use for treatment of
autoimmune diseases and allergies may not be acceptable because of the aforementioned side effects. Furthermore, often transplanted organs
ultimately fail despite the use of immune suppression, and about 40 of transplanted organs survive no more than five years. 

Through Aditxt, Adimune has
the right of use to the exclusive worldwide license for commercializing ADI nucleic acid-based technology (which is currently at the pre-clinical
stage) from Loma Linda University. ADI uses a novel approach that mimics the way the body naturally induces tolerance to our own tissues therapeutically induced immune tolerance ). While immune suppression requires continuous administration to prevent rejection
of a transplanted organ, induction of tolerance has the potential to retrain the immune system to accept the organ for longer periods
of time. ADI may allow patients to live with transplanted organs with significantly reduced immune suppression. ADI is a technology platform
which we believe can be engineered to address a wide variety of indications. 

Advantages 

ADI is a nucleic acid-based
technology e.g. , DNA-based), which we believe selectively suppresses only those immune cells involved in attacking or rejecting
self and transplanted tissues and organs. It does so by tapping into the body s natural process of cell turnover (i.e., apoptosis)
to retrain the immune system to stop unwanted attacks on self or transplanted tissues. Apoptosis is a natural process used by the body
to clear dying cells and to allow recognition and tolerance to self-tissues. ADI triggers this process by enabling the cells of the immune
system to recognize the targeted tissues as self. Conceptually, it is designed to retrain the immune system to accept the
tissues, similar to how natural apoptosis reminds our immune system to be tolerant to our own self tissues. 

While various groups have
promoted tolerance through cell therapies and ex vivo manipulation of patient cells (i.e., takes place outside the body),
to our knowledge, we will be unique in our approach of using in-body induction of apoptosis to promote tolerance to specific tissues. In
addition, ADI treatment itself will not require additional hospitalization but only an injection of minute amounts of the therapeutic
drug into the skin. 

Moreover, preclinical studies
have demonstrated that ADI treatment significantly and substantially prolongs graft survival, in addition to successfully reversing 
other established immune-mediated inflammatory processes. 

License Agreement with Loma Linda University LLU 

On March 15, 2018, we entered
into a License Agreement with LLU, which was subsequently amended on July 1, 2020. Pursuant to the LLU License Agreement, we obtained
the exclusive royalty-bearing worldwide license to all intellectual property, including patents, technical information, trade secrets,
proprietary rights, technology, know-how, data, formulas, drawings, and specifications, owned or controlled by LLU and/or any of its affiliates
(the LLU Patent and Technology Rights and related to therapy for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (the ADI 
technology). In consideration for the LLU License Agreement, we issued 625 shares of common stock to LLU.

PEARSANTA, INC. 

Formed in January 2023, our
subsidiary Pearsanta , Inc. Pearsanta seeks to take personalized medicine to a whole new level by delivering Health
by the Numbers. Since its founding, Pearsanta has been building the platform for enabling our vision of lab quality testing, anytime,
anywhere. Our plan for Pearsanta s platform is for it to be the transactional backbone for sample collection, sample processing
(on- and off-site), and reporting. This will require the development and convergence of multiple components developed by Pearsanta, or
through transactions with third parties, including collection devices, lab-on-a-chip technologies, Lab Developed Test (LDT)
assays, a data-driven analysis engine, and telemedicine. According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future, the clinical
and consumer diagnostic market is estimated to hit 429.3 billion by 2030. 

We believe that timely and
personalized testing enables far more informed treatment decisions. Pearsanta s platform is being developed as a seamless digital
healthcare solution. This platform will integrate at-location sample collection, Point-of-Care POC and LDT assays, and
an analytical reporting engine, with telemedicine-enabled visits with licensed physicians to review test results and, if necessary, order
a prescription. Pearsanta s goal of extending its platform to enable consumers to monitor their health more proactively as the goal
is to provide a more complete picture about someone s dynamic health status, factoring in genetic makeup and their response to medication.
The POC component of Pearsanta would enable diagnostic testing at-home, at work, in pharmacies, and more to generate results quickly so
that an individual can access necessary treatment faster. With certain infections, prescribing the most effective treatment according
to one s numbers can prevent hospital emergency room admissions and potentially life-threatening consequences. 

Examples of indication-focused
tests for the Test2Treat platform will include the evaluation for advanced urinary tract infections UTIs ), COVID-19/flu/respiratory
syncytial virus, sexually transmitted infections, gut health, pharmacogenomics (i.e., how your genes affect the way your body responds
to certain therapeutics), and sepsis. We believe that these offerings are novel and needed as the current standard of care using broad
spectrum antibiotic treatment can be ineffective and potentially life-threatening. For example, improperly prescribed antibiotics may
approach 50 of outpatient cases. Further, according to an article published in Physician s Weekly, only 1 of board-certified critical
care medicine physicians are trained in infectious disease. 

Central to Pearsanta s
innovation is Mitomic Technology Platform, which we acquired from MDNA in January 2024. 

We acquired the assets comprising
our mitomic technology platform from MDNA. This platform seeks to harness the unique properties of mitochondrial DNA mtDNA to detect disease through non-invasive, blood-based liquid biopsies. The Mitomic Technology Platform is designed to identify specific
mutations in mtDNA indicative of various diseases. Due to its high mutation rate and cell persistence, mitochondrial DNA is an excellent
biomarker for early disease detection. This platform allows for the rapid and accurate identification of disease-associated biomarkers,
which can significantly enhance early diagnosis and treatment. Key Products Under Development at Time of Acquisition: 

Key Products Under Development
at Time of Acquisition: 

Mitomic Endometriosis Test (MET ): 

Purpose: To provide an accurate
and non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis, a condition that affects approximately 1 in 10 women of reproductive age worldwide. 

Clinical Validation: MET 
has demonstrated high accuracy in predicting surgical outcomes in women suspected of having endometriosis. The test has shown significant
promise in reducing the diagnostic delay, which averages around ten years. 

Impact: Early and precise diagnosis
through MET can lead to timely and effective treatment, significantly improving patient outcomes and quality of life 

53 

Mitomic Prostate Test (MPT ): 

Purpose: To enhance the detection
of clinically significant prostate cancer, reducing reliance on PSA testing, which often results in false positives and over-diagnosis. 

Clinical Validation: MPT 
has shown the ability to predict prostate cancer accurately, distinguishing between aggressive and nonaggressive forms. This specificity
is crucial in guiding treatment decisions and reducing unnecessary interventions. 

Impact: MPT aims to
improve patient outcomes by ensuring that only those with clinically significant prostate cancer receive treatment, thereby avoiding
the side effects of unnecessary procedures. To date, our primary focus with respect to the Mitomic Technology Platform has been the integration
of such assets into our business. Our initial plans for the Mitomic Technology Platform are to complete product development, manufacturing
and clinical validation of the MET and the MPT . 

Licensed Technologies AditxtScore TM 

We have sublicensed to Pearsanta
an exclusive worldwide sub-license for commercializing the AditxtScore technology which provides a personalized comprehensive profile
of the immune system. AditxtScore is intended to detect individual immune responses to viruses, bacteria, peptides, drugs, supplements,
bone marrow and solid organ transplants, and cancer. It has broad applicability to many other agents of clinical interest impacting the
immune system, including those not yet identified such as emerging infectious agents. 

AditxtScore is being designed
to enable individuals and their healthcare providers to understand, manage and monitor their immune profiles and to stay informed about
attacks on or by their immune system. We believe AditxtScore can also assist the medical community and individuals by being able to anticipate
the immune system s potential response to viruses, bacteria, allergens, and foreign tissues such as transplanted organs. This technology
may be able to serve as a warning signal, thereby allowing for more time to respond appropriately. Its advantages include the ability
to provide simple, rapid, accurate, high throughput assays that can be multiplexed to determine the immune status with respect to several
factors simultaneously, in approximately 3-16 hours. In addition, it can determine and differentiate between distinct types of cellular
and humoral immune responses (e.g., T and B cells and other cell types). It also provides for simultaneous monitoring of cell activation
and levels of cytokine release (i.e., cytokine storms). 

We are actively involved in
the regulatory approval process for AditxtScore assays for clinical use and securing manufacturing, marketing, and distribution partnerships
for application in the various markets. To obtain regulatory approval to use AditxtScore as a clinical assay, we have conducted validation
studies to evaluate its performance in detection of antibodies and plan to continue conducting additional validation studies for new applications
in autoimmune diseases. 

Advantages 

The sophistication of the
AditxtScore technology includes the following: 

greater sensitivity/specificity. 

20-fold higher dynamic range,
greatly reducing signal to noise compared to conventional assays. 

ability to customize assays
and multiplex a large number of analytes with speed and efficiency. 

ability to test for cellular
immune responses (i.e., T and B cells and cytokines). 

proprietary reporting algorithm. 

License Agreement with Leland Stanford Junior
University Stanford 

On February 3, 2020, we entered
into an exclusive license agreement (the February 2020 License Agreement with Stanford with regard to a patent concerning
a method for detection and measurement of specific cellular responses. Pursuant to the February 2020 License Agreement, we received an
exclusive worldwide license to Stanford s patent with regard to use, import, offer, and sale of Licensed Products (as defined in
the agreement). The license to the patented technology is exclusive, including the right to sublicense, beginning on the effective date
of the agreement, and ending when the patent expires. Under the exclusivity agreement, we acknowledged that Stanford had already granted
a non-exclusive license in the Nonexclusive Field of Use, under the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Field of Use in the Licensed Territory
(as those terms are defined in the February 2020 License Agreement ). However, Stanford agreed not to grant further licenses
under the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Field of Use in the Licensed Territory. On December 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment
to the February 2020 License Agreement which extended our exclusive right to license the technology deployed in AditxtScore TM and
securing worldwide exclusivity in all fields of use of the licensed technology.

ADIVIR, INC. 

Formed in April of 2023, Adivir ,
Inc., is Aditxt s most recently formed wholly owned subsidiary, dedicated to the clinical and commercial development efforts of
innovative antiviral products, which have the potential to address a wide range of infectious diseases, including those that currently
lack viable treatment options. Central to Adivir s innovation is the ongoing contemplated transaction with Appili. Appili is an
infectious disease biopharmaceutical company that is purposefully built, portfolio-driven, and people-focused to fulfill its mission of
solving life-threatening infections. By systematically identifying urgent infections with unmet needs, Appili aims to strategically develop
a pipeline of novel therapies to prevent deaths and improve lives. The Company is currently advancing a diverse range of anti-infectives,
including a vaccine candidate to eliminate a severe biological weapon threat, a topical antiparasitic for the treatment of a disfiguring
disease, and a novel easy to use, liquid oral formulation targeting parasitic and anaerobic infections. Appili is at the epicenter of
the global fight against infection, led by a proven management team. 

Our Team 

Aditxt has assembled an entrepreneurial
team of experts from a variety of different business, engineering, and scientific fields, and commercial backgrounds, with collective
experience that ranges from founding startup innovation companies, to developing and marketing biopharmaceutical and diagnostic products,
to designing clinical trials, and management of private and public companies. We have deep experience in identifying and accessing promising
health innovations and developing them into products and services with the ability to scale. We understand the capital markets, both public
and private, as well as M A and facilitating complex IPOs. 

Going Concern 

We were incorporated on September
28, 2017 and have not generated significant revenues to date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we had a net loss of 29,472,886
and cash of 328,596 as of September 30, 2024. 

 We are currently over 90 days
past due on a significant number of vendor obligations. The Company will require significant additional capital to operate in the normal
course of business and fund clinical studies in the long-term. We believe our remaining funds on hand will not be sufficient to fund our
operations for the next 12 months and such creates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond one year. 

Financial Results 

We have a limited operating
history. Therefore, there is limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our prospects
must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early
stages of operations. Our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, show a net loss of 29,472,886. We expect
to incur additional net expenses over the next several years as we continue to maintain and expand our existing operations. The amount
of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.

Results of Operations 

Results of operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

We generated revenue of 6,854
and 124,486 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 467,536 and 106,922, respectively. The decrease in revenue and costs of goods sold during the three months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in AditxtScore TM orders due
to decreased COVID testing being done. 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from operations of 4,701,038. This is due to general and administrative expenses of 3,718,804,
which includes approximately 870,361 in payroll expenses, 1,869,859 in professional fees, and 32 in stock-based compensation. Research
and development expenses were 491,552, which includes 102,914 in consulting expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were 30,000. 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of 8,095,209. This is due to general and administrative expenses of 7,169,863,
which includes approximately 3,351,000 in payroll expenses, 1,128,000 in professional fees, and 103,031 in stock-based compensation.
Research and development expenses were 898,724, which includes 151,605 in consulting expenses and 49,209 in stock-based compensation.
Sales and marketing expenses were 44,186, which includes 1,752 in stock-based compensation. 

The decrease in expenses during
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to decreased research and development
spend and decreased compensation expense due to reduced headcount. 

Results of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

We generated revenue of 130,810
and 563,879 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 556,469 and 470,969, respectively. The decrease in revenue and costs of goods sold during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in AditxtScore TM orders. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss
from operations of 22,212,665. This is due to general and administrative expenses of 11,502,097, which includes approximately 2,949,534
in payroll expenses, 3,805,023 in professional fees, and 28,702 in stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses were
 10,190,178 which includes 1,282,505 in consulting expenses and 6,712,663 in stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses
were 94,731. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, we incurred a loss from operations of 18,111,541. This is due to general and administrative expenses of 15,209,789.
This includes approximately 7,682,000 in payroll expenses, 3,063,000 in professional fees, and 484,502 in stock-based compensation.
Research and development expenses were 2,771,100, which includes 1,034,698 in consulting expenses and 165,382 in stock-based compensation.
Sales and marketing expenses were 223,562, which includes 6,787 in stock-based compensation. 

The increase in expenses during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increased research and development
spend and 1,000,000 fee paid to Evofem as part of an amendment to a merger agreement which was recorded to general and administrative
expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have incurred substantial
operating losses since inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never
become profitable. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 162,867,941. We had working capital of (22,280,585) as
of September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased zero in fixed assets. 

Our condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. 

On April 20, 2023, the Company
entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor, pursuant to which
the Company agreed to sell to such investor pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 991 shares of
common stock of the Company (the Common Stock at a purchase price of 1,950.40 per Pre-Funded Warrant. Concurrently with
the sale of the Pre-Funded Warrants, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in a concurrent private placement, for each Pre-Funded Warrant
purchased by the investor, such investor received from the Company an unregistered warrant (the Warrant to purchase two
shares of Common Stock. The warrants have an exercise price of 1,376.00 per share and are exercisable for a three-year period. In addition,
the Company issued a warrant to the placement agent to purchase up to 60 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 2,440.00 per
share. 

56 

On August 31, 2023, the Company
entered into a securities purchase agreement (the August Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor for the
issuance and sale in a private placement (the Private Placement of (i) pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 25,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 0.040 per share, and (ii) warrants (the Common
Warrants to purchase up to 25,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of 400.00 per share. The Private
Placement closed on September 6, 2023. The net proceeds to the Company from the Private Placement were approximately 9 million, after
deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company utilized net proceeds
received from the Private Placement for (i) payment of approximately 3.1 million in outstanding obligations, (ii) repayment of approximately
 0.4 million of outstanding debt, and (iii) continuing operating expenses and working capital. 

On December 29, 2023, the
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor the
 December Purchaser for the issuance and sale in a private placement (the December Private Placement of (i)
pre-funded warrants (the December Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 30,928 shares of the Company s Common Stock,
par value 0.001 at an exercise price of 0.04 per share, and (ii) warrants (the December Common Warrants to purchase up
to 61,856 shares of the Company s Common Stock, at a purchase price of 194.00 per share. 

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase Common Stock of the Company Certain
Outstanding Warrants held by the Purchaser to 184.00 per share in consideration for the cash payment by the December Purchaser
of 5.00 per share of Common Stock underlying the Certain Outstanding Warrants, effective immediately. 

The December Private Placement
closed on January 4, 2024. The net proceeds to the Company from the December Private Placement were approximately 5.5 million, after
deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. 

In addition, the Company agreed
to pay H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright certain expenses and issued to Wainwright or its designees warrants (the
 December Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,856 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal
to 242.50 per share. The December Placement Agent Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance and have a term of exercise equal
to three years from the date of issuance. 

On May 2, 2024, the Company
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the May PIPE Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant
to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to such investors in a private placement (the Private Placement (i) an aggregate
of 4,186 shares of the Company s Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock ),
(ii) an aggregate of 4,186 shares of the Company s Series D-1 Preferred Stock (the Series D-1 Preferred Stock ), and
(iii) warrants (the May PIPE Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 40,328 shares of the Company s common stock.
The Private Placement closed on May 6, 2024. The gross proceeds from the Private Placement were approximately 4.2 million, prior to deducting
the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used 1.0 million of the net proceeds
to fund certain obligations under its merger agreement with Evofem Biosciences, Inc. and the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

On August 8, 2024, the Company
entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Registered Direct Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors,
pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such investors 4,700 shares (the Registered Direct Shares of
common stock of the Company (the Common Stock ), pre-funded warrants (the Registered Direct Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 23,555 shares of Common Stock of the Company (the Registered Direct Pre-Funded Warrant Shares ),
having an exercise price of 0.04 per share, at a purchase price of 42.40 per share of Common Stock and a purchase price of
 42.36 per Registered Direct Pre-Funded Warrant (the Registered Direct Offering ). The shares of Common Stock and Registered
Direct Pre-Funded Warrants (and shares of common stock underlying the Registered Direct Pre-Funded Warrants) were offered by the Company
pursuant to its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-280757), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission on August 6, 2024. 

57 

The closing of the sales of these securities under the Registered Direct
Purchase Agreement took place on August 9, 2024. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately 1.0 million, prior to deducting
placement agent s fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used 500,000 of the net proceeds from
the offering to fund certain obligations under its Amended and Restated Merger agreement with Evofem Biosciences, Inc and the remainder
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

We will need significant additional
capital to continue to fund our operations and the clinical trials for our product candidates. We may seek to sell common stock, preferred
stock or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing.
In addition, we may seek to raise cash through collaborative agreements or from government grants. The sale of equity and convertible
debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and certain of those securities may have rights senior to those of our common
shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities, or other debt financing, these
securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require
us to relinquish valuable rights. 

The source, timing, and availability
of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, and, more specifically, on the progress of our clinical development
program. Funding may not be available when needed, at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Lack of necessary funds may require us to, among
other things, delay, scale back or eliminate expenses including some or all our planned development, including our clinical trials. While
we may need to raise funds in the future, we believe the current cash reserves should be sufficient to fund our operation for the foreseeable
future. Because of these factors, we believe that this creates doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of
our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that
affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that our critical
accounting policies described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Plan of Operations Critical
Accounting Policies in our Prospectus, dated September 1, 2020, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b), are critical to fully
understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. The following involve the most judgment and complexity: 

Research and development 

Stock-based compensation expense 

Accordingly, we believe the
policies set forth above are critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. If actual
results or events differ materially from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies, our reported
financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. 

58 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have during the
periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the
JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the
extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. 

When favorable, we have chosen
to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new
or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. 

We are in the process of evaluating
the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain
conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including
without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s
report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total
annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the
date of the completion of our IPO (December 31, 2025); (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible
debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of
the SEC.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

We are not required to provide
the information required by this Item as we are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b)
and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not materially changed since the Company determined that we did not
maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and the following weaknesses still exist as of September 30, 2024. 

We did not maintain adequate
controls over the documentation of accounting and financial reporting policies and procedures. Specifically, we did not maintain policies
and procedures to ensure account reconciliations were adequately prepared and reviewed by management. 

We did not retain individuals
and/or entities with extensive knowledge to recognize and record technical and complex accounting issues. 

We did not maintain the sufficient
procedures for the identification and cutoff of accounts payable. 

These material weaknesses
resulted in material misstatements to the financial statements, which were corrected. There were no changes to previously released financial
results. We are in the process of remediating these material weaknesses. 

Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

No change occurred in our
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September
30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

60 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Our business, financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including
those set forth below and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, the occurrence of any one
of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. 

Our financial situation creates doubt whether
we will continue as a going concern. 

The Company was incorporated
on September 28, 2017 and through the date of this report has generated no significant revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2023
and 2022, the Company had a net loss of 32,390,447 and 27,649,876, respectively. Our condensed consolidated financial statements as
of September 30, 2024, show a net loss of 29,472,886. Our cash and cash equivalents were approximately 328,596 as of September 30, 2024.
There can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations
or additional financing through private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital requirements.
To the extent that funds generated from any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have
to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on
acceptable terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If adequate working capital
is not available, we may be forced to discontinue operations, which would cause investors to lose their entire investment. 

If we fail to obtain the capital necessary
to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue or complete our product development and you will likely lose your entire investment. 

We will need to continue to
seek capital from time to time to continue development of our lead drug candidate beyond our initial combined Phase I/IIa clinical trial
and to acquire and develop other product candidates. Once approved for commercialization, we cannot provide any assurances that any revenues
it may generate in the future will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations. 

61 

Our business or operations
may change in a manner that would consume available funds more rapidly than anticipated and substantial additional funding may be required
to maintain operations, fund expansion, develop new or enhance products, acquire complementary products, business or technologies, or
otherwise respond to competitive pressures and opportunities, such as a change in the regulatory environment or a change in preferred
treatment modalities. In addition, we may need to accelerate the growth of our sales capabilities and distribution beyond what is currently
envisioned, and this would require additional capital. However, we may not be able to secure funding when we need it or on favorable terms.
We may not be able to raise sufficient funds to commercialize the product candidates we intend to develop. 

If we cannot raise adequate
funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we will have to delay, scale back or eliminate our research and development activities, clinical
studies, or future operations. We may also be required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators, which arrangements may
require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or products that we otherwise would not consider relinquishing, including rights
to future product candidates or certain major geographic markets. This could result in sharing revenues which we might otherwise retain
for ourselves. Any of these actions may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We are currently over 90 days past due on
a significant amount of vendor obligations. We may not be able to refinance, extend or repay our substantial indebtedness owed to our
secured and unsecured lenders, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going
concern. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we have approximately 11.8 million in accounts payable with approximately 9.3 million that is over 90 days past due. If we are unable
to repay these amounts, as well as our existing debt obligations at maturity, and we are otherwise unable to extend the maturity dates
or refinance these obligations, we would be in default. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise the necessary amount
of capital to repay these obligations or that we will be able to extend the maturity dates or otherwise refinance these obligations. Upon
a default, our secured lenders would have the right to exercise their rights and remedies to collect, which would include foreclosing
on our assets. Accordingly, a default would have a material adverse effect on our business, and we would likely be forced to seek bankruptcy
protection. 

We may not be able to effect the transactions
contemplated under the Merger Agreement with Evofem or the Arrangement Agreement with Appili. If we are unable to do so, we will incur
substantial costs associated with withdrawing from the transaction. 

In connection with the Merger
Agreement with Evofem and the Arrangement Agreement with Appili, we have incurred substantial costs planning and negotiating the transactions.
These costs include, but are not limited to, costs associated with employing and retaining third-party advisors who perform financial,
auditing and legal services required before we were able to enter into such agreements and which services will continue to be utilized
as we seek to complete such transactions. If, for whatever reason, such transactions fail to close, we will still be responsible for these
costs, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial results. 

We will need to raise substantial additional
capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us
to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts and strategic M A initiatives, or cease operations. 

We do not expect that our
current cash position will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the next 12 months. We also do not presently have sufficient
cash to fund certain obligations under our Merger Agreement with Evofem or our Arrangement Agreement with Appili. In addition, we are
required to complete an equity or debt financing with minimum gross proceeds of at least 20 million in order to close the transactions
contemplated under our Arrangement Agreement with Appili. Our operating plan may change because of many factors currently unknown
to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or
other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements
or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize,
our product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have
sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we
have specific strategic considerations. 

62 

Any additional fundraising
efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize
our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable
to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance
of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares
to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute our existing stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness
would result in increased fixed payment obligations, and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations
on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other
operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through
arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to
relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. 

If we are unable to obtain
funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our research or development
programs or the commercialization of any product candidate or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business
opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

A significant number of shares of our common
stock may be issued and sold upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and upon the conversion of the Company s convertible
preferred stock. 

As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,172 shares of common stock issuable
under outstanding options, 528,610 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants at various exercise prices and
approximately 268,825 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the standard conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock.
To the extent that holders of existing options, warrants or convertible preferred stock sell the shares of common stock issued upon the
exercise of options or warrants or conversion of the convertible preferred stock, the market price of our common stock may decrease due
to the additional selling pressure in the market. The risk of dilution from issuances of shares of common stock underlying existing
options, warrants and convertible preferred stock may cause shareholders to sell their common stock, which could further decline in the
market price. 

We have entered into a Purchase Agreement
with an equity line investor. If we sell shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement, our existing stockholders will experience
immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may go down. 

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
we have agreed to sell up to 150,000,000 of shares of our common stock at our option and subject to certain limitations. In addition,
we may issue up to 56,250 shares of our common stock as a commitment fee under the Purchase Agreement. As of the date hereof, we have
not issued or sold any shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement. The sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement will have a dilutive impact on our existing stockholders. The equity line investor may resell some or all of the shares
we issue to it under the Purchase Agreement and such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, which decline
could be significant. 

Even if we can raise additional funding,
we may be required to do so on terms that are dilutive to you. 

The capital markets have been
unpredictable in the past for unprofitable companies such as ours. In addition, it is generally difficult for development stage companies
to raise capital under current market conditions. The amount of capital that a company such as ours is able to raise often depends on
variables that are beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, or at all. If we
can consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet our future needs. If adequate funds are not available
on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, including our results of operations, financial condition and our continued viability will
be materially adversely affected. 

The amount of capital we may
need depends on many factors, including the progress, timing and scope of our product development programs; the progress, timing and scope
of our preclinical studies and clinical trials; the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals; the time and cost necessary
to further develop manufacturing processes and arrange for contract manufacturing; our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative,
licensing and other commercial relationships; and our partners commitment of time and resources to the development and commercialization
of our products. 

63 

Our obligations to certain of our creditors
are secured by security interests in our assets, so if we default on those obligations, our creditors could foreclose on some or all of
our assets. 

Our obligations to certain
of our creditors are secured by security interests in our assets. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 7.7 million was owed to such
secured creditors. Under such agreements, we are required to pay 277,800 on a weekly basis to such creditors. If we default on our obligations
under these agreements, our secured creditors could foreclose on its security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which
would harm our financial condition and results of operations and would require us to reduce or cease operations and possibly seek Bankruptcy
Protection. 

In the event we pursue Bankruptcy Protection,
we will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with such proceedings. 

In the event we file for relief
under the United States Bankruptcy Code, our operations, our ability to develop and execute our business plan and our continuation as
a going concern will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings, including, among others: our ability
to execute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; the additional, significant costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees;
our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence, and our
ability to comply with terms and conditions of that financing; our ability to continue our operations in the ordinary course; our ability
to maintain our relationships with our consumers, business partners, counterparties, employees and other third parties; our ability to
obtain, maintain or renew contracts that are critical to our operations on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions; our ability to
attract, motivate and retain key employees; the ability of third parties to use certain limited safe harbor provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code to terminate contracts without first seeking Bankruptcy Court approval; the ability of third parties to force us to into
Chapter 7 proceedings rather than Chapter 11 proceedings and the actions and decisions of our stakeholders and other third parties who
have interests in our bankruptcy proceedings that may be inconsistent with our operational and strategic plans. Any delays in our bankruptcy
proceedings would increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings and may increase
our costs associated with the bankruptcy process or result in prolonged operational disruption for us. Also, we would need the prior approval
of the bankruptcy court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business during the course of any bankruptcy proceedings, which
may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties
associated with any bankruptcy proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that could occur during
any such proceedings. There can be no guarantees that if we seek Bankruptcy Protection we will emerge from Bankruptcy Protection as a
going concern or that holders of our common stock will receive any recovery from any bankruptcy proceedings. 

In the event we are unable to pursue Bankruptcy
Protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or, if pursued, successfully emerge from such proceedings, it may be
necessary to pursue Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code for all or a part of our businesses. 

In the event we are unable
to pursue Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or, if pursued, successfully emerge from such proceedings,
it may be necessary for us to pursue Bankruptcy Protection under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code for all or a part of our
businesses. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with
the priorities established by the United States Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly
smaller distributions being made to our stakeholders than those we might obtain under Chapter 11 primarily because of the likelihood that
the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled
manner and as a going concern. 

64 

We are under a panel monitor from Nasdaq
as we have historically failed to comply with certain listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, which could result in our Common
Stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

On
November 21, 2023, we received written notice from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the Public Float Rule. On December 29,
2023, we received written notice from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule, but will be subject
to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year. If within that one-year monitoring period, Nasdaq finds the Company again out of
compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule, we will not be permitted to provide Nasdaq with a plan of compliance with respect
to that deficiency and Nasdaq will not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with respect to that
deficiency. If this occurs, Nasdaq will issue a delist determination letter and we will have the opportunity to request a new hearing.
In the event that we fall out of compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule, we intends to request a new hearing. 

On
October 3, 2024, we were notified by Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed
securities to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that
a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based
on the closing bid price of our common stock between August 20, 2024 and October 1, 2024, we no longer met the minimum bid price requirement. The
notification letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market and, at this
time, the common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ADTX. 

The
notification letter provides that the Company has 180 calendar days, or until April 1, 2025, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the bid price of our common stock must have a closing bid price of at least 1.00 per share for
a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance by April 1, 2025, an additional 180 days may be granted
to regain compliance, so long as we meet Nasdaq continued listing requirements (except for the bid price requirement) and notifies Nasdaq in
writing of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. If we do not qualify for the second compliance period
or fail to regain compliance during the second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify us of its determination to delist our
common stock, at which point we will have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. 

As
previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company, on October
1, 2024, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation
to effect a reverse stock split. The reverse stock split became effective as of 4:01 p.m. Eastern Time on October 1, 2024, and our common
stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis when the Nasdaq Stock Market opened on October 2, 2024. The reverse stock split was primarily
intended to bring us into compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement. As of the date of this prospectus supplement,
our common stock has had a closing bid price of at least 1.00 for fourteen consecutive business days. 

If
we are delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. If we are not able to obtain
a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for our common stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders
to sell their shares. We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may be required to seek approval from our stockholders
to affect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, however, under Nasdaq
Rule 5810(b)(3)(a)(iv) , we will not be entitled to an additional compliance period if the proposed reverse split reverse
stock split ratio, when combined with any prior reverse stock splits implements in the prior period of two years would exceed 250-for-1
in the aggregate . Our October 2024 reverse stock split when combined with our August 2023 reverse stock split exceeded 250-for-1
in the aggregate. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future reverse stock split would be approved by our stockholders. Further,
there can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our common stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged
or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of old shares of our common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split.
Even if the reverse stock split is approved by our stockholders, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules. 

If we are delisted from Nasdaq,
but obtain a substitute listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially
more price volatility than experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on any such substitute
market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result
of these factors, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of our common stock, warrants and pre-funded warrants
would likely be significantly adversely affected. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability
to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.
