, the Company Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 introduces a new credit loss methodology, Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL"), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses, while also providing additional transparency about credit risk. ASU 2016-13 amends guidance on reporting credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold previously required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the reserve for credit losses. In addition, entities need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination.

 million to the allowance for credit losses. The remaining noncredit discount (based on the adjusted amortized cost basis) will be accreted into interest income at the effective interest rate as of January 1, 2023. The adoption of CECL resulted in an increase to our total allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment of million, an increase in our allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments of million, a reclassification of PCI discount from loans to the allowance for credit losses of million, and an increase in deferred tax asset of million. The Company also recorded a net reduction of retained earnings of million upon adoption. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis and established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. When a loan or portion of a loan is determined to be uncollectible, the portion deemed uncollectible is charged against the allowance and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Portfolio Segmentation Pooled Loans Portfolio segmentation is defined as the pooling of loans based upon similar risk characteristics such that quantitative methodologies and qualitative adjustment factors for estimating the allowance for credit losses are constructed for each segment. The Company has identified nine portfolio segments of loans: Commercial Agriculture, Commercial Real Estate Owner Occupied, Commercial Real Estate Non-Owner Occupied, Residential Real Estate, Real Estate Construction, Farm Real Estate, Lease Financing Receivable and Consumer and Other Loans. The allowance for credit losses for Pooled Loans is estimated based upon periodic review of the collectability of the loans quantitatively correlating historical loan experience with reasonable and supportable forecasts using forward looking information. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow ("DCF") method to estimate the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses for loans evaluated on a collective pooled basis. For each segment, a loss driver analysis ("LDA") is performed in order to identify appropriate loss drivers and create a regression model for use in forecasting cash flows. The LDA utilizes the Company s own Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council s FFIEC Call Report data for all segments except indirect auto and all new and unknown values. Peer data is incorporated into the analysis for all segments except indirect auto and all new and unknown values. The Company uses regression analysis to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default for the changes in the economic factors for the loss driver segments. The identified loss drivers for all segments as of September 30, 2024 were national unemployment rate and national gross domestic product growth. Peer data is utilized in our model as more statistically supportable data. The Company uses actual loss data for the lease portfolio due to a lack of appropriate peer leasing data to forecast loss drivers. Key inputs into the DCF model include loan-level detail, including the amortized cost basis of individual loans, payment structure, loss history, and forecasted loss drivers. The Company uses the central tendency midpoint seasonally adjusted forecasts from the Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC"). Other key assumptions include the probability of default ("PD"), loss given default ("LGD"), and prepayment/curtailment rates. When possible, the Company utilizes its own PDs for the reasonable and supportable forecast period. When it is not possible to use the Company s own PDs, the LDA is utilized to determine PDs based on the forecasted economic factors. In all cases, the LDA is then utilized to determine the long-term historical average, which is reached over the reversion period. When possible, the Company utilizes its own LGDs for the reasonable and supportable forecast period. When it is not possible to use the Company s own LGDs, the LGD is derived using a method referred to as Frye Jacobs. The Frye Jacobs method is a mathematical formula that traces the relationship between LGD and PD over time and projects the LGD based on the level of PD forecasted. In all cases, the Frye Jacobs method is utilized to calculate LGDs during the reversion period and long-term historical average. Prepayment and curtailment rates were calculated based on the Company s own data utilizing a one-year average. When the discounted cash flow method is used to determine the allowance for credit losses, management incorporates expected prepayments to determine the effective interest rate utilized to discount expected cash flow. Adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be made to account for differences in current or expected qualitative risk characteristics such as changes in: (i) lending policies and procedures; (ii) experience and depth of lending and management staff; (iii) quality of credit

 days past due. H istorically, the Company has not experienced uncollectible accrued interest receivable on its investment securities. However, the Company would generally write off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income if the Company does not reasonably expect to receive payments. Due to the timely manner in which accrued interest receivables are written off, the amounts of such write offs are immaterial. 

 Not measuring an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable due to the Company s policy of writing off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner, as described above.

The Company did not record an allowance for available-for-sale securities on Day 1 as the investment portfolio consisted primarily of debt securities explicitly or implicitly backed by the U.S. Government for which credit risk was deemed minimal. The impact going forward will depend on the composition, characteristics, and credit quality of the securities portfolio as well as the economic conditions at future reporting periods. On , the Company ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this Update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A public business entity that is a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filer, such as the Company, was to adopt the amendments in this Update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. In November 2019, however, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) , which deferred the effective date for ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , for SEC filers that were eligible to be smaller reporting companies as of November 15, 2019, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the ASU provisions did t have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure for loans that have been charged off. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did t have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

At September 30, 2024, there were a tot al of securities in t he portfolio with unrealized losses mainly due to higher current market rates when compared to the time of purchase. At December 31, 2023 , the Company owned securities that were in an unrealized loss position. The u nrealized losses on securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers securities are of high credit quality, management has the intent and ability to hold these securities for the foreseeable future, and the decline in fair value is largely due to currently higher market rates when compared to the time of purchase. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or reset date. The Company does not intend to sell until recovery and does not believe selling will be required before recovery. Each quarter, we perform an analysis to determine if any of the unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale are comprised of credit losses as compared to unrealized losses due to market interest rate adjustments. Our assessment includes a review of the unrealized loss for each security issuance held; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including external credit ratings and recent downgrades; and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value. We also consider the extent to which the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, and any guarantee of issued amounts by those agencies. The portfolio continues to consist of a mix of fixed and floating-rate, high quality securities, largely rated AA (or better), displaying an overall effective duration of approximately years. No credit losses were determined to be present as of September 30, 2024, as there was no credit quality deterioration noted. Therefore, no provision for credit losses on securities was recognized for the third quarter of 2024.

The following tables present credit exposures by internally assigned risk grades as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The risk rating analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or at all. The Company s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly graded loans. The Company s internally assigned risk grades are as follows: Pass loans which are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying collateral. 

 Special Mention loans where a potential weakness or risk exists, which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected. 

 Substandard loans that have a well-defined weakness based on objective evidence and are characterized by the distinct possibility that Civista will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

 Doubtful loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard asset. In addition, these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on existing circumstances. 

 Loss loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible, or of such value that continuance as an asset is not warranted.

Nonaccrual Loans: Loans are considered for nonaccrual status upon reaching days delinquency, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, although the Company may be receiving partial payments of interest and partial repayments of principal on such loans. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to the unpaid principal balance. Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty: From time to time, the Company may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications result in new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, other-than-significant payment delay or a combination thereof, among other things. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , there were modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Individually Evaluated Loans: Larger Commercial Agricultural and Commercial Real Estate loan relationships, and Residential Real Estate and Consumer loans that are part of a larger relationship, are tested for impairment on a quarterly basis. These loans are analyzed to determine if it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. If management determines that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is recognized through an allowance estimate or a charge-off to the allowance. The Company s policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans does not differ from its overall policy for interest recognition.

Collateral-dependent loans consist primarily of Residential Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Agricultural loans. These loans are individually evaluated when foreclosure is probable or when the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral. In the case of Commercial Agricultural loans secured by equipment, the fair value of the collateral is estimated by third-party valuation experts. Loan balances are charged down to the underlying collateral value when they are deemed uncollectible. Note that the Company did not elect to use the collateral maintenance agreement practical expedient available under CECL. Foreclosed Assets Held For Sale Foreclosed assets acquired in settlement of loans are carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell and are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were foreclosed assets included in Other assets. Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk from a contractual obligation to extend credit. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense recognized within provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated credit loss includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The estimate of expected credit loss is based on the historical loss rate for the loan class in which the loan commitments would be classified as if funded.

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Introduction 
 The following discussion focuses on the consolidated financial condition of the Company at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, and the consolidated results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), relating to such matters as the Company s financial condition, anticipated operating results, cash flows, business line results, credit quality expectations, prospects for new lines of business, economic trends (including interest rates) and similar matters. Forward-looking statements reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events. These statements are generally identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as believe, belief, expect, anticipate, may, could, intend, intent, estimate, plan, foresee, likely, will, should or other similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 
 current and future economic and financial market conditions, including the effects of inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy, an increasing federal government budget deficit, the failure of the federal government to raise the federal debt ceiling and/or possible future U.S. government shutdowns over budget disagreements, uncertainties surrounding the November 2024 U.S. Presidential election and potential changes in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, slowing gross domestic product, tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, and other factors beyond our control, any of which may result in adverse impacts on our deposit levels and composition, the quality of investment securities available for purchase, demand for loans, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing loans made by Civista; 

recent and future bank failures may reduce customer confidence, affect sources of funding and liquidity, increase regulatory requirements and costs, adversely affect financial markets and/or have a negative reputational impact on the banking industry as a whole, any of which could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations; 

adverse changes in the real estate market, which could cause increases in delinquencies and non-performing assets, including additional loan charge-offs, and could depress our income, earnings and capital; 

changes in interest rates resulting from national and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which may adversely affect interest rates, interest margins, loan demand and interest rate sensitivity; 

operational risks, reputational risks, legal and compliance risks, and other risks related to potential fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, or failures, disruptions or breaches in security of our systems, including those resulting from computer viruses or cyber-attacks; 

our ability to secure sensitive or confidential client information against unauthorized disclosure or access through computer systems and telecommunication networks, including those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, which may prove inadequate; 

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks; 

competitive pressures and factors among financial services organizations could increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures, changes to third-party relationships and our ability to recruit and retain qualified management and banking personnel;

 Financial Condition 
 Total assets of the Company at September 30, 2024 were 4,061,423 compared to 3,861,418 at December 31, 2023, an increase of 200,005, or 5.2 . The increase in total assets was due to increases in net loans of 178,110, cash and cash equivalents of 14,256, securities available for sale of 8,516, loans held for sale of 6,574, . These increases were partially offset by decreases in premises and equipment of 6,802 and swap assets of 4,285. Total liabilities at September 30, 2024 were 3,666,985 compared to 3,489,416 at December 31, 2023, an increase of 177,569, or 5.1 . The increase in total liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in total deposits of 238,704, partially offset by a decrease in short-term FHLB advances of 50,953.

Included in Commercial Agriculture loans above were 214 of PPP loans as of September 30, 2024 and 326 of PPP loans as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Loans held for sale increased 6,574, or 381.1 , since December 31, 2023. The increase was due to increases in both the number of loans and average loan balances held for sale. At September 30, 2024, thirty-five loans totaling 8,299 were held for sale as compared to nine loans totaling 1,725 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Net loans have increased 178,110, or 6.3 , since December 31, 2023. The increase at September 30, 2024 can be attributed to increases in many categories, primarily Commercial Real Estate Non-Owner Occupied, Residential Real Estate, and Real Estate Construction, offset by decreases in Commercial Real Estate Owner Occupied, Lease Financing Receivables, and Consumer and Other. At September 30, 2024, the net loan to deposit ratio was 93.1 compared to 94.6 at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the net loan to deposit ratio is primarily the result of an increase in deposits. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, provisions made to the allowances for credit losses and off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled 4,668, compared to a provision of 2,706 during the same period in 2023. The increase in the provision was principally related to loan growth during the first nine months of 2024. On a quarterly basis, changes in economic conditions will require CECL model assumption inputs to change and management will determine if, any, further refinements will be necessary to the estimation process. 
 
 Net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 1,080, compared to net charge-offs of 535 for the first nine months of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company charged off a total of 38 loans. Twelve Commercial Agriculture loans totaling 1,079, three Lease Financing Receivables totaling 186, four Residential Real Estate loan totaling 67, one Commercial Real Estate Non-Owner Occupied loan for 174, and eighteen Consumer and Other loans totaling 74 were charged off in the first nine months of the year. In addition, during the first nine months of 2024, the Company had recoveries on previously charged-off Commercial Agriculture loans of 263, Commercial Real Estate Non-Owner Occupied loans of 12, Residential Real Estate loans of 178, Real Estate Construction loans of 12, Leasing Finance Receivables of 1 and Consumer and Other loans of 34. For each loan category, as well as in total, the percentage of net charge-offs to loans was less than one percent. Each of these factors was considered by management as part of the examination of both the level and mix of the allowance by loan type as well as the overall level of the allowance. 
 
 Management specifically evaluates loans that do not share common risk characteristics for estimates of loss. To evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio, management considers specific reserve allocations for identified portfolio loans, reserves for delinquencies and historical reserve allocations. Loss migration rates are calculated over a three-year period for all portfolio segments. Management also considers certain economic factors for trends that management uses to account for the qualitative and environmental changes in risk, which affects the level of the reserve.

 Management analyzes each individually evaluated Commercial Agriculture and Commercial Real Estate loan relationship with a balance of 350 or larger, on an individual basis and designates a loan as individually evaluated when it is in nonaccrual status or when an analysis of the borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements. Loans held for sale are excluded from consideration as impaired. Loans are generally moved to nonaccrual status when 90 days or more past due. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off when deemed uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans was 1.36 at September 30, 2024 and 1.30 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The available-for-sale securities portfolio increased by 8,516, from 618,272 at December 31, 2023 to 626,788 at September 30, 2024. Management continually evaluates our securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, and the level of interest rate risk to which the Company is exposed. These evaluations may cause the Company to change the level of funds it deploys into investment securities and change the composition of its investment securities portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all pledging requirements. 
 
 Premises and equipment, net, decreased 6,802 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was the result of depreciation of 6,895 and disposals of 501, partially offset by purchases of 594. The decrease in depreciation was mainly attributable to leasing operations as operating leases mature. New leases in 2024 are primarily finance leases which are recorded in loans on the balance sheet. 
 
 Bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") increased 1,577 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase was the result of the purchase of a new insurance policy as well as increases in the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policies. 
 
 Swap assets decreased 4,285 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily the result of a decline in market value. 
 
 Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

The Company had approximately 497,852 and 499,429 of uninsured deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Uninsured deposit amounts are estimated based on the portions of customer account balances that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of 250. 
 
 Total deposits at September 30, 2024 increased 238,704 from year-end 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 85,383 from year-end 2023, while interest-bearing deposits, including savings and time deposits, increased 324,087 from December 31, 2023. The decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily due to a 32,000 decrease in noninterest-bearing business accounts as customers migrated to interest-bearing accounts, and a 36,800 decrease in noninterest-bearing accounts related to the former tax refund processing program. The decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily due to a decrease of 14,600 in interest-bearing personal accounts, a 7,500 decrease in Jumbo NOW accounts, a 3,700 decrease in interest-bearing business accounts, and a 966 decrease in interest-bearing public fund accounts. The 248,704 increase in savings and money market accounts was primarily due to a 115,000 increase in brokered money market accounts, 87,500 in a new Trust money market account and a 61,000 increase in business money market accounts, which increases were; partially offset by a 18,400 decrease in statement savings and a 5,100 decrease in business savings accounts. Total increase in time deposits of 104,500 is due to increase of 22,700 in jumbo deposits, and 45,400 in all other certificate categories. The year-to-date average balance of total deposits increased 222,092, compared to the average balance for the same period in 2023, mainly due to a 429,848 increase in the average balance of time deposits, somewhat offset by a 239,146 decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. 
 
 Short-term FHLB advances decreased 50,953 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was due to paying down borrowings.

 Swap liabilities decreased 4,285 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was the result of a decrease in fair value of swap liabilities. 
 
 Accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased 1,687 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unfunded commitments related to the investments in qualified affordable housing projects of 1,500. 
 
 Shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 394,438, or 9.7 of total assets, compared to 372,002, or 9.6 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase was as a result of net income of 21,790 and an increase in the fair value of securities, net of tax, of 7,619, partially offset by dividends on common shares of 7,544. 
 
 Total outstanding common shares at September 30, 2024 were 15,736,528 which increased from 15,695,424 common shares outstanding at December 31, 2023. Common shares outstanding increased due to the grant of 51,578 restricted common shares to certain officers under the Company s 2014 Incentive Plan, offset by 8,956 common shares surrendered by officers to the Company to pay taxes upon vesting of restricted shares and 1,518 restricted common shares forfeited. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The Company had net income of 8,366 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2,021 from net income of 10,387 for the same three months of 2023. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were 0.53 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.66 for the same period in 2023. The primary reasons for the changes in net income are explained below. 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 29,233, a decrease of 2,271 from 31,504 for the same three months of 2023. This decrease was a result of an increase of 9,226 in interest expense, partially offset by an increase of 6,955 in total interest income. Interest-earning assets averaged 3,705,866 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 325,697 from 3,380,169 for the same period of 2023. The Company s average interest-bearing liabilities increased from 2,315,118 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,898,978 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s fully tax equivalent net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.16 and 3.63 , respectively. 
 Total interest and dividend income was 52,741 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6,955 from 45,786 for the same period in 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income is attributable to a 7,166 increase in interest and fees on loans, a 259 increase in interest income on taxable securities and a 33 increase in interest income on tax-exempt securities. The 7,166 increase in interest and fees on loans is attributable to increases in both average balances and loan yield. The average balance of loans increased by 352,205 or 13.1 , to 3,031,884 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,679,679 for the same period in 2023. The loan yield increased to 6.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.87 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest on taxable securities increased 259 to 3,258 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,999 for the same period in 2023. The average balance of taxable securities increased 4,430 to 363,584 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 359,154 for the same period in 2023. The yield on taxable securities increased 29 basis points to 3.24 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.95 for the same period in 2023. Interest on tax-exempt securities increased 33 to 2,369 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,336 for the same period in 2023. The average balance of tax-exempt securities increased 5,206 to 291,254 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 286,048 for the same period in 2023. The yield on tax-exempt securities increased 6 basis points to 3.83 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.77 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Total interest expense increased 9,226, or 64.6 , to 23,508 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 14,282 for the same period in 2023. The change in interest expense can be attributed to increases in rates, accompanied by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased 583,860 to 2,898,978, as compared to 2,315,118 for the same period in 2023. Interest incurred on deposits increased by 7,342 to 16,926 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9,584 for the same period in 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by 439,205 to 2,405,219 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, accompanied by an increase in the rate paid on time deposits from 4.64 in 2023 to 5.37 in

 2024. Interest expense incurred on short-term FHLB advances increased because of the average balances increasing 154,475 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 The following table presents the condensed average balance sheets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The daily average loan amounts outstanding are net of unearned income and include loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans. The average balance of securities is computed using the carrying value of securities. Rates are annualized and taxable equivalent yields are computed using a 21 tax rate for tax-exempt interest income. The average yield has been computed using the historical amortized cost average balance for available-for-sale securities.

Total noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 27,981, an increase of 1,359, or 5.1 , from 26,622 reported for the same period of 2023. The increase in total noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in equipment expense. The increase in compensation expense was due to annual merit increases, employee insurance, and other payroll related expenses. The average full time equivalent (FTE) employees were 526 at September 30, 2024, an increase of two FTEs over the same period of 2023. The decrease in equipment expense was primarily related to a decrease in equipment depreciation from leasing operations as operating leases mature. 
 
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1,551, down 309 compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rates for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.6 and 15.2 , respectively. The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Company s effective tax rate is the permanent tax differences, primarily consisting of tax-exempt interest income from municipal investments and loans, low-income housing tax credits, tax-deductible captive insurance premiums and bank owned life insurance income. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 The Company had net income of 21,790 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 11,519 from net income of 33,309 for the same nine months of 2023. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were 1.39 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.12 for the same period in 2023. The primary reasons for the changes in net income are explained below. 
 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 85,356, a decrease of 10,088 from 95,444 for the same nine months of 2023. This decrease was a result of an increase of 30,230 in total interest expense, partially offset by an increase in total interest and dividend income of 20,142. Interest-earning assets averaged 3,626,368 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 342,158 from 3,284,210 for the same period of 2023. The Company s average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2,811,188 for the first nine months of 2024 from 2,270,844 for the same period in 2023. The Company s fully tax equivalent net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.16 and 3.77 , respectively. 
 
 Total interest and dividend income increased 20,142 to 153,462 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. This change was the result of an increase in the average balance of loans, accompanied by a higher yield on the portfolio. The average balance of loans increased by 351,399, or 13.5 , to 2,959,031 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,607,632 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The loan yield increased to 6.15 for 2024, from 5.81 in 2023.

The average balance of interest-bearing deposits in other banks decreased 2,963 to 20,419 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23,382 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased 26 basis points to 4.93 for 2024, compared to 4.67 for 2023.

The change in interest expense can be attributed to an increase in rate and an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased 540,344 to 2,811,188, compared to 2,270,844 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

 The following table presents the condensed average balance sheets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The daily average loan amounts outstanding are net of unearned income and include loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans. The average balance of securities is computed using the carrying value of securities. Rates are annualized and taxable equivalent yields are computed using a 21 tax rate for tax-exempt interest income. The average yield has been computed using the historical amortized cost average balance for available-for-sale securities.

The Company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2023, the Company recorded an increase in the allowance for credit losses of 4,296. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 5,188, an increase of 3,077, from 2,111 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision was principally related to loan growth during the year. As time progresses, the results of economic conditions will require CECL model assumption inputs to change and further refinements to the estimation process may also be identified.

Total noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 84,225, an increase of 2,522, or 3.1 , from 81,703 for the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation expense and software maintenance expense partially offset by decreases in equipment expense and professional services. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to annual merit increases, employee insurance and other payroll related expenses. The year-to-date average full time equivalent FTE employees were 534 on September 30, 2024, an increase of three FTEs over the same period in 2023. The increase in software maintenance expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in software maintenance contracts, including new digital banking software investments. The decreases in equipment expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in equipment depreciation from leasing operations as operating leases mature. Professional services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to advisory fees in 2023 for the Company s MasterCard contract. 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3,406, down 2,662 compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.9 to 13.5 from 15.4 for the same period in 2023. The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Company s effective tax rate is the permanent tax differences, primarily consisting of tax-exempt interest income from municipal investments and loans, low-income housing tax credits, tax-deductible captive insurance premiums and bank owned life insurance income.

 Future loan demand of Civista may be funded by increases in deposit accounts, proceeds from payments on existing loans, the maturity of securities, and the sale of securities classified as available-for-sale. Additional sources of funds may also come from borrowing in the Federal Funds market and/or borrowing from the FHLB. Through its correspondent banks, Civista maintains federal funds borrowing lines totaling 50,000. As of September 30, 2024, Civista had total credit availability with the FHLB of 829,545 with standby letters of credit totaling 128,400 and a remaining borrowing capacity of approximately 412,499. In addition, CBI maintains a credit line with a third party lender totaling 10,000. No borrowings were outstanding by CBI under this credit line as of September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company s primary market risk exposure is interest-rate risk and, to a lesser extent, liquidity risk. All of the Company s transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure. 
 Interest-rate risk is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates. Accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value. However, excessive levels of interest-rate risk can pose a significant threat to the Company s earnings and capital base. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains interest-rate risk at prudent levels is essential to the Company s safety and soundness. 
 Evaluating a financial institution s exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control interest-rate risk and the organization s quantitative level of exposure. When assessing the interest-rate risk management process, the Company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems and internal controls are in place to maintain interest-rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity. Evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires the Company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity and, where appropriate, asset quality. 
 The Federal Reserve Board, together with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, issue policy statements and guidance on sound practices for managing interest-rate risk, which form the basis for ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of interest-rate risk management at supervised institutions. The guidance also outlines fundamental elements of sound management and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing interest-rate risk. The guidance emphasizes the need for active board of director and senior management oversight and a comprehensive risk-management process that effectively identifies, measures, and controls interest-rate risk. 
 Financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid. The rates of interest an institution earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Since market interest rates change over time, an institution is exposed to lower profit margins (or losses) if it cannot adapt to interest-rate changes. For example, assume that an institution s assets carry intermediate- or long-term fixed rates and that those assets were funded with short-term liabilities. If market interest rates rise by the time the short-term liabilities must be refinanced, the increase in the institution s interest expense on its liabilities may not be sufficiently offset if assets continue to earn at the long-term fixed rates. Accordingly, an institution s profits could decrease on existing assets because the institution will have either lower net interest income or, possibly, net interest expense. Similar risks exist when assets are subject to contractual interest-rate ceilings, or rate sensitive assets are funded by longer-term, fixed-rate liabilities in a decreasing-rate environment. 
 Several techniques may be used by an institution to minimize interest-rate risk. One approach used by the Company is to periodically analyze its assets and liabilities and make future financing and investment decisions based on payment streams, interest rates, contractual maturities, and estimated sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates. Such activities fall under the broad definition of asset/liability management. The Company s primary asset/liability management technique is the measurement of the Company s asset/liability gap, that is, the difference between the cash flow amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced (or repriced) during a given period. For example, if the asset amount to be repriced exceeds the corresponding liability amount for a certain day, month, year, or longer period, the institution is in an asset sensitive gap position. In this situation, net interest income would increase if market interest rates rose or decrease if market interest rates fell. If, alternatively, more liabilities than assets will reprice, the institution is in a liability sensitive position. Accordingly, net interest income would decline when rates rose and increase when rates fell. Also, these examples assume that interest rate changes for assets and liabilities are of the same magnitude, whereas actual interest rate changes generally differ in magnitude for assets and liabilities.

 Several ways an institution can manage interest-rate risk include selling existing assets or repaying certain liabilities; matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities, for example, by shortening terms of new loans or securities; and hedging existing assets, liabilities, or anticipated transactions. An institution might also invest in more complex financial instruments intended to hedge or otherwise change interest-rate risk. Interest rate swaps, futures contracts, options on futures, and other such derivative financial instruments often are used for this purpose. Because these instruments are sensitive to interest rate changes, they require management expertise to be effective. The Company has not purchased derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk in the past and does not currently intend to purchase such instruments in the near future. Financial institutions are also subject to prepayment risk in falling rate environments. For example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at new, lower rates. Prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce the Company s interest income and overall asset yields. A large portion of an institution s liabilities may be short-term or due on demand, while most of its assets may be invested in long-term loans or securities. Accordingly, the Company seeks to have in place sources of cash to meet short-term demands. These funds can be obtained by increasing deposits, borrowing, or selling assets. FHLB advances and wholesale borrowings may also be used as important sources of liquidity for the Company. 
 The following table provides information about the Company s financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, based on certain prepayment and account decay assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The table shows the changes in the Company s net portfolio value (in amount and percent) that would result from hypothetical interest rate increases of 200 basis points and 100 basis points and interest rate decreases of 100 basis points and 200 basis points at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The change in net portfolio value from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, can be attributed to a couple of factors. The yield remains inverted but has shifted upward since the end of the year. Additionally, the volume of assets and funding sources has changed, but the asset mix remains centered on loans. The volume of loans and certificates of deposit has increased, while the volume of other borrowings and non-maturing deposits has decreased. The volume shifts from the end of the year contributed to a decrease in the base net portfolio value. Beyond the change in the base level of net portfolio value, projected movements in rates, up or down, would also lead to changes in market values. The change in the rates up scenarios for the 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point movements would lead to a slightly larger decrease in the market value of liabilities than assets. Accordingly, the Company sees an increase in the net portfolio value. The change in the rates down scenarios for the 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point movements would lead to a larger increase in the market value of liabilities than in assets, leading to a decrease in the net portfolio value.
