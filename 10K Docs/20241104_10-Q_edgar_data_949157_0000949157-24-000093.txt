 CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY 
 Condensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 (amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts) 
 (Unaudited) 
 
 1. General 
 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Century Aluminum Company should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In management s opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of financial results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the first nine months of 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. Throughout this Form 10-Q, and unless expressly stated otherwise or as the context otherwise requires, Century Aluminum , Century , the Company , we , us , our and ours refer to Century Aluminum Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Our consolidated financial statements include the consolidated results of the Jamalco joint venture Jamalco ), an unincorporated joint venture between General Alumina Jamaica Limited GAJL ), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Clarendon Alumina Production Limited CAP ). CAP's interest in the joint venture is reflected as noncontrolling interest on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 ). Among other changes, the ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and extends certain annual disclosures to interim periods. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning with its annual financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2023-07. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 ). The guidance is intended to improve income tax disclosure requirements by requiring (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (ii) the disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning with its annual financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and is required to be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2023-09. 
 
 2. Acquisition of Jamalco 
 On May 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Jamaica Holdings, Inc. CAJH ), completed the acquisition of all the outstanding share capital of General Alumina Holdings Limited GAHL ), the indirect holder of a 55 interest in Jamalco, an unincorporated joint venture engaged in bauxite mining and alumina production in Jamaica. The remaining 45 interest in Jamalco is owned by CAP, which is owned by the Government of Jamaica. The results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition was 1.00, primarily due to the seller experiencing financial distress following curtailment of Jamalco's operations in the second half of 2021 due to a facility fire, with operations restarting in the second half of 2022. 
 
 The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations, resulting in the Company recognizing the assets and liabilities at fair value with the excess over fair value of consideration transferred to the seller presented as a bargain purchase gain of 245.9 million recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company finalized the Jamalco purchase price allocation and recognized measurement period adjustments, which primarily resulted from third-party valuation adjustments to risk premiums, reducing the value of property, plant and equipment by 29.0 million. This reduction in value of property plant and equipment resulted in a corresponding reduction to the bargain purchase gain of 29.0 million decreasing the value of the previously recognized bargain purchase gain of

 (Unaudited) 

 273.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to 245.9 million as of March 31, 2024. The Company finalized its purchase accounting as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 The following table represents the allocation of the estimated fair value of identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest at the date of acquisition

 The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the results of operations of the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as if the acquisition of Jamalco had been completed on January 1, 2023.

 Nine months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue 1,722.8 Earnings (77.0) 
 
 3. Curtailment of Operations - Hawesville 
 In August 2022, we fully curtailed production at the Hawesville facility. We continue to explore all options related to the Hawesville facility. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred curtailment charges of approximately 2.7 million and 5.0 million, respectively. These charges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no scrap and materials sales as of the three months ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we incurred curtailment charges of approximately 2.0 million and 13.4 million, including 0.0 million and 9.0 million related to demand capacity charges for power, respectively. These charges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of 0.0 million and 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 We enter into contracts to sell primary aluminum and alumina to our customers. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligations with our customers are satisfied. Our obligations under the contracts are satisfied when we transfer control of our primary aluminum or alumina to our customers which is generally upon shipment or delivery to customer directed locations. The amount of consideration we receive, thus the revenue we recognize, is a function of volume delivered, market price of primary aluminum which is based on the LME, plus regional premiums and any value-added product premiums or alumina which is based on the alumina pricing index, plus Atlantic differential. 
 
 The payment terms and conditions in our contracts vary and are not significant to our revenue. We complete an appropriate credit evaluation for each customer at contract inception. Customer payments are due in arrears and are recognized as accounts receivable - net and due from affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 In connection with our sales agreements with certain customers, including Glencore, we invoice the customer prior to physical shipment of goods for a majority of production generated from each of our U.S. domestic smelters. For those sales, revenue is recognized only when the customer has specifically requested such treatment and has made a commitment to purchase the product. The goods must be complete, ready for shipment and separated from other inventory with control over the goods passing to the customer. We must retain no further performance obligations. 
 
 Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Amounts recognized in Due to affiliates was 41.5 million and 30.6 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 6. Fair Value Measurements 
 We measure certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 In general, reporting entities should apply valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 
 The fair value hierarchy provides transparency regarding the inputs we use to measure fair value. We categorize each fair value measurement in its entirety into the following three levels, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement 
 Level 1 Inputs - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. 
 Level 2 Inputs - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 Inputs - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 When valuing Level 3 assets and liabilities, we use certain significant unobservable inputs. Management incorporates various inputs and assumptions including forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility and macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and discount rates. Our estimates of significant unobservable inputs are ultimately based on our estimates of risks that market participants would consider when valuing our assets and liabilities.

 7. Earnings Per Share 
 Basic and diluted earnings per share EPS amounts are calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed. Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive securities. Prior to the three months ended March 31, 2024, diluted EPS amounts were calculated by applying the if-converted method as net income allocated to participating securities was not significant.

 8. Shareholders Equity 
 Common Stock 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 195,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value per share, authorized under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, of which 99,985,365 shares were issued and 92,798,844 shares were outstanding at September 30, 2024, and 99,876,385 were issued and 92,689,864 shares were outstanding at December 31, 2023. 
 The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock which are currently outstanding, including our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or which we may designate and issue in the future. 
 Preferred Stock 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share, authorized under our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Our Board of Directors may issue preferred stock in one or more series and determine for each series the dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, liquidating preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting that series, as well as the designation thereof. Depending upon the terms of preferred stock established by our Board of Directors, any or all of the preferred stock could have preference over the common stock with respect to dividends and other distributions and upon the liquidation of Century. In addition, issuance of any shares of preferred stock with voting powers may dilute the voting power of the outstanding common stock. 
 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 
 Shares Authorized and Outstanding . In 2008, we issued 160,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 51,817 and 52,284 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding, respectively. Glencore holds all of the issued and outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 The issuance of common stock under our stock incentive programs, debt exchange transactions and any stock offering that excludes Glencore participation triggers anti-dilution provisions of the preferred stock agreement and results in the automatic conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shares into shares of common stock. The conversion of preferred to common shares is 100 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock. Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has a par value of 0.01 per share. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a 60.0 million common stock repurchase program and during the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors increased the size of the program by 70.0 million. Under the program, Century is authorized to repurchase up to 130.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, from time to time, on the open market at prevailing market prices, in block trades or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 Shares of common stock repurchased are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. From time to time, treasury shares may be reissued as contributions to our employee benefit plans and for the conversion of convertible preferred stock. When shares are reissued, we use an average cost method for determining cost. The difference between the cost of the shares and the reissuance price is added to or deducted from additional paid-in capital. 
 Through September 30, 2024 we repurchased 7,186,521 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 86.3 million. We have made no repurchases since April 2015 and have approximately 43.7 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization as of September 30, 2024.

 9. Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of 2.0 million and a tax benefit of 11.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of 3.0 million and a tax benefit of 21.2 million, respectively. The change is primarily due to changes in pretax income amounts and jurisdictional mix on a year over year basis. 
 Our income tax expense or benefit for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The application of the accounting requirements for income taxes in interim periods, after consideration of our valuation allowance on domestic losses, causes a significant variation in the typical relationship between income tax expense benefit and pre-tax accounting income loss as reported on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all of Century's U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a full valuation allowance. 
 Section 45X of The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA contains a production tax credit equal to 10 of certain eligible production costs, including, without limitation, labor, energy, depreciation and amortization and overhead expenses. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on the production tax credit requirements under Internal Revenue Code Section 45X (the IRA Regulations ). The IRA Regulations provide guidance on rules that taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the IRA Section 45X tax credit. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a reduction of 47.3 million and 69.9 million in Cost of goods sold and a reduction of 0.8 million and 2.0 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in an equally offsetting manufacturing credit receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a current manufacturing credit receivable of 78.8 million and 59.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a non-current manufacturing credit receivable of 52.4 million and 0.0 million, respectively within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We received proceeds of 245.2 million, after payment of certain financing fees and related expenses. The 2028 Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, which began on October 1, 2021, at a rate of 7.5 per annum in cash. The 2028 Notes are senior secured obligations of Century, ranking equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of Century, but effectively senior to unsecured debt to the extent of the value of collateral. We are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the indenture governing our Senior Notes as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the 2028 Notes was 254.3 million . Although we use quoted market prices for identical debt instruments, the markets on which they trade are not considered to be active and are therefore considered Level 2 fair value measurements. 
 2.75 Convertible Notes due 2028 
 In April 2021, we completed a private offering of 86.3 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due May 1, 2028 unless earlier converted, repurchased, or redeemed (the Convertible Notes ).

The Convertible Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, which began on November 1, 2021, at a rate of 2.75 per annum in cash.

 the Company's common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the indenture. As of September 30, 2024, the conversion rate remains unchanged. 
 The Convertible Notes are the Company s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes equal in right of payment to any of the Company s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company s senior secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company s subsidiaries. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the Convertible Note s does not exceed the outstanding principal amount. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was 96.1 million . Although we use quoted market prices for identical debt instruments, the markets on which they trade are not considered to be active and are therefore considered Level 2 fair value measurements. 
 U.S. Revolving Credit Facility 
 We and certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries have a senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (as amended from time to time, the U.S. revolving credit facility ).

 Vlissingen Credit Facility 
 On December 9, 2022, Vlissingen entered into a 90.0 million Facility Agreement with Glencore International AG, which was amended and extended on October 1, 2024. The availability period for borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility was extended by two years and now ends on December 2, 2026. Pursuant to the terms of the Vlissingen Credit Facility, Vlissingen may borrow from time to time up to 90.0 million in one or more loans at either (i) a fixed interest rate equal to 8.75 per annum (the Fixed Rate ), or (ii) a variable interest rate equal to the 1-month SOFR rate plus 3.687 percentage points, subject to an absolute maximum level of 9.00 and an absolute minimum level of 7.00 . The Fixed Rate is only applicable to borrowings made on or before December 1, 2024, after which the Variable Rate shall apply to all borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were 10.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility. 
 
 The Vlissingen Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including with respect to mergers, guarantees and preservation and dispositions of assets. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants 
 Hancock County Industrial Revenue Bond s 
 As part of the purchase price for our acquisition of the Hawesville facility, we assumed IRBs which were issued in connection with the financing of certain solid waste disposal facilities constructed at the Hawesville facility. The IRBs bear interest at a variable rate not to exceed 12 per annum determined weekly based upon prevailing rates for similar bonds in the industrial revenue bond market and interest on the IRBs is paid quarterly. The IRBs are secured by a letter of credit issued under our U.S revolving credit facility and mature in April 2028. 
 Surety Bond Facility 
 As part of our normal business operations, we are required to provide surety bonds or issue letters of credit in certain states in which we do business as collateral for certain workers' compensation obligations. In June 2022, we entered into a surety bond facility with an insurance company to provide such bonds when applicable. As of September 30, 2024, we had issued surety

 bonds totaling 6.6 million. As we had previously guaranteed our workers' compensation obligations through issuance of letters of credit against our revolving credit facility, the surety bond issuance increases credit facility availability. 
 
 12. Commitments and Contingencies 
 We have pending against us or may be subject to various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial, stockholder, environmental, safety and health matters and are involved in other matters that may give rise to contingent liabilities. While the results of such matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the ultimate outcome of any such matters and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation and estimating liabilities, should the resolution or outcome of these actions be unfavorable, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. 
 In evaluating whether to accrue for losses associated with legal or environmental contingencies, it is our policy to take into consideration factors such as the facts and circumstances asserted, our historical experience with contingencies of a similar nature, the likelihood of our prevailing and the severity of any potential loss. For some matters, no accrual is established because we have assessed our risk of loss to be remote. Where the risk of loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual, either on an individual basis or with respect to a group of matters involving similar claims, based on the factors set forth above. While we regularly review the status of, and our estimates of potential liability associated with, contingencies to determine the adequacy of any associated accruals and related disclosures, the ultimate amount of loss may differ from our estimates. 
 Legal Contingencies 
 Ravenswood Retiree Medical Benefits 
 In November 2009, Century Aluminum of West Virginia CAWV filed a class action complaint for declaratory judgment against the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union USW ), the USW s local and certain CAWV retirees, individually and as class representatives CAWV Retirees ), seeking a declaration of CAWV s rights to modify terminate retiree medical benefits. Later in November 2009, the USW and representatives of a retiree class filed a separate suit against CAWV, Century Aluminum Company, Century Aluminum Master Welfare Benefit Plan, and various John Does with respect to the foregoing. On August 18, 2017, the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia approved a settlement agreement in respect of these actions, pursuant to which agreement, CAWV agreed to make payments into a trust for the benefit of the CAWV Retirees in the aggregate amount of 23.0 million over the course of ten years. Upon approval of the settlement, we paid 5.0 million to the aforementioned trust in September 2017 and recognized a gain of 5.5 million to arrive at the then-net present value of 12.5 million. CAWV has agreed to pay the remaining amounts under the settlement agreement in annual increments of 2.0 million for nine years. As of September 30, 2024, 2.0 million was recorded in Other current liabilities and 1.5 million was recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 PBGC Settlement 
 In 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC regarding an alleged cessation of operations at our Ravenswood f acility (the PBGC Settlement Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the PBGC Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately 17.4 million. Under certain circumstances, in periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations, we were able to defer one or more of these payments, provided that we provide the PBGC with acceptable security for such deferred payments. We historically elected to defer certain payments under the PBGC Settlement Agreement and provided the PBGC with the appropriate security. In October 2021, we amended the PBGC Settlement Agreement (the Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement such that we removed the deferral mechanism and agreed to contribute approximately 2.4 million per year to our defined benefit pension plans for a total of approximately 9.6 million, over the next four years beginning on November 30, 2022 and ending on November 30, 2025, subject to acceleration if certain terms and conditions are met in such amendment. As of September 30, 2024, we made contributions of 7.2 million including 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, as of September 30, 2023, we made contributions of 6.9 million including 4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Grundartangi also has a separate 25 MW power purchase agreement with Landsvirkjun at LME-based variable rate. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 Labor Commitments 
 The bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Vlissingen, Hawesville, Sebree and Jamalco facilities are represented by labor unions, representing approximately 58 of our total workforce. 
 Approximately 87 of Grundartangi s work force is represented by five labor unions, governed by a labor agreement that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees. This agreement is effective through December 31, 2024. 
 100 of Vlissingen's work force is represented by the Federation for the Metal and Electrical Industry FME ), a Netherlands' employers' organization for companies in the metal, electronics, electrical engineering and plastic sectors.

 19, 2022, covering the curtailment period. Century Sebree's labor agreement with the USW for its employees is effective through October 28, 2028. Mt. Holly employees are not represented by a labor union. 
 Approximately 61 of Jamalco s work force is represented by the Union of Technical, Administrative, and Supervisory Personnel UTASP through separately negotiated labor agreements for hourly and salaried employee groups. Both contracts were effective through December 31, 2023. Jamalco is currently in the process of negotiating new contracts with both the salaried and hourly employee groups. 
 Contingent obligations 
 We have a contingent obligation in connection with the unwind of a contractual arrangement between CAKY, Big Rivers Electric Corporation Big Rivers and a third party and the execution of a long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy, a member of a cooperative of Big Rivers, in July 2009. This contingent obligation consists of the aggregate payments made to Big Rivers by the third party on CAKY s behalf in excess of the agreed upon base amount under the long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy. As of September 30, 2024, the principal and accrued interest for the contingent obligation was 32.0 million, which was fully offset by a derivative asset. We may be required to make installment payments for the contingent obligation in the future. These payments are contingent based on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville s operations. As of September 30, 2024, the LME forward market prices do not exceed the threshold for payment. In addition, based on the current level of Hawesville's operations, including the temporary curtailment, we believe that we will not be required to make payments on the contingent obligation during the term of the agreement, which expires in 2028. There can be no assurance that circumstances will not change thus accelerating the timing of such payments.

 16. Subsequent Events 
 
 We evaluate subsequent events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. There are two types of subsequent events (1) recognized, or those that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements, and (2) non-recognized, or those that provide evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date. 
 
 On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations regarding implementing Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provide guidance on rules taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the tax credit. The government has incentivized the production of aluminum by offering a tax credit equal to 10 of eligible domestic production costs. The Final Regulations have been amended to allow, direct material costs as defined in 1.263A-1(e)(2)(i)(A), indirect material costs as defined in 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(E), or any costs related to the extraction or acquisition of raw materials to be taken into account as production costs. 
 
 We have concluded it is appropriate to apply IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance , to account for the refundable tax credit as an income grant. Therefore, the issuance of Final Regulations provides us with reasonable assurance regarding the eligibility of direct material costs and indirect material costs and provided additional evidence regarding the Company s estimated manufacturing credit receivable as it relates to carbon and 
 29 

supplies utilized in production. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 34.9 million as a reduction in Cost of goods sold, and 21.7 million and 13.2 million as an increase in our manufacturing credit receivable and our Non-current manufacturing credit receivable within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 However, with regards to the definition of aluminum, the Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that additional consideration is necessary prior to finalizing proposed 1.45X-4(b)(1), which the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to do at a later date. For that reason, 1.45X-4(b)(1) is reserved in these final regulations. With regards to estimates related to the definition of aluminum, namely the inclusivity of the costs of alumina, the Company will continue to assess the estimated credit calculation as final regulations on that matter are issued.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis MD&A provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Century Aluminum Company and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements - see Forward-Looking Statements above. 
 Overview 
 We are a global producer of primary aluminum with aluminum reduction facilities, or smelters, in the United States and Iceland. In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we have a 55 joint venture interest in the Jamalco bauxite mining operation and alumina refinery in Jamaica. The Jamalco refinery supplies a substantial amount of the alumina used for the production of primary aluminum at our Grundartangi, Iceland facility. We also own a carbon anode production facility located in the Netherlands. The key determinants of our results of operations and cash flows from operations are as follows 
 the price of primary aluminum, which is based on the London Metal Exchange LME and other exchanges, plus any regional premiums and value-added product premiums 
 the cost of goods sold, the principal components of which are electrical power, alumina, carbon products, labor and other controllable costs, which in aggregate represent more than 78 of our cost of goods sold and 
 our production volume and product mix. 
 Recent Developments 
 Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act 
 On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations implementing Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provide guidance on rules taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the tax credit. The government has incentivized the production of aluminum by offering a tax credit equal to 10 of eligible domestic production costs. Based on the final regulations, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 47.3 million and 69.9 million as a reduction in Cost of goods sold and 0.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively, as a reduction in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in an equally offsetting receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recognized a manufacturing credit receivable of 78.8 million and 59.3 million, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024, we recognized a non-current manufacturing credit receivable of 52.4 million within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 U.S. Department of Energy Award 
 On March 25, 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy DOE Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations selected the Company to begin award negotiations for up to 500.0 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act funding to build a new aluminum smelter as part of the Industrial Demonstrations Program IDP ). With the help of this funding, we plan to build the first new U.S. primary aluminum smelter in 45 years at a site within the Ohio Mississippi River Basins. 
 Acquisition of 55 interest in Jamalco 
 On May 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, CAJH, acquired for 1.00 all of the outstanding share capital of GAHL, the indirect holder of a 55 interest in Jamalco, an unincorporated joint venture with CAP, which is owned by the Government of Jamaica. Jamalco is engaged in bauxite mining and alumina refining in Jamaica. The Company's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, GAJL, is the manager of Jamalco. Jamalco has alumina production capacity of approximately 1.4 million tonnes. We finalized the purchase accounting and recognized a bargain purchase gain of 245.9 million within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our historical financial statements for periods prior to May 2, 2023 do not include the results of Jamalco. Refer to Note 2. Acquisition of Jamalco for further information. 
 Equipment Failure 
 Starting in June 2023, we experienced power disruptions due to damage to the Jamalco power generation unit. The equipment returned to full capacity as of the end of October 2023. We are actively engaged with our insurance carriers in connection with this equipment failure to determine the specific amount of coverage available to us under our business interruption insurance, including any applicable deductibles. The cumulative impact of the equipment failure was approximately 38.8 million.

Hurricane Beryl 
 In early July 2024, Hurricane Beryl temporarily impacted our operations in Jamaica. Jamalco s production facilities escaped significant damage, but the port facility was impacted by the storm, where a portion of the alumina conveyor was damaged. Jamalco's bauxite mining and alumina production joint venture returned to full production on July 12, 2024. Jamalco secured alternative port arrangements to allow for alumina shipments to its customers while the repairs to the conveyor were ongoing. On September 17, 2024, we resumed normal shipping operations at Jamalco s Rocky Point port following the completion of repairs to the port. 
 Hawesville curtailment 
 In August 2022 we fully curtailed production at the Hawesville facility. We continue to explore all options related to the Hawesville facility. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred curtailment charges of approximately 2.7 million and 5.0 million, respectively. These charges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no scrap and materials sales as of the three months ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we incurred curtailment charges of approximately 2.0 million and 13.4 million, including 0.0 million and 9.0 million related to demand capacity charges for power, respectively. These charges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of 0.0 million and 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Pricing of aluminum 
 The overall price of primary aluminum consists of three components (i) the base commodity price, which is based on quoted prices on the LME and other exchanges plus (ii) any regional premium (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States MWP and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe EDPP )) plus (iii) any value-added product premium. Each of these price components has its own drivers and variability. 
 The price of aluminum is influenced by a number of factors, including global supply-demand balance, inventory levels, speculative activities by market participants, production activities by producers, geopolitical and economic conditions, as well as production costs in major production regions. These factors can be highly variable and difficult to predict, which can lead to significant volatility in the price of aluminum. Increases or decreases in primary aluminum prices drive variability in our revenues (assuming all other factors are unchanged). From time to time, we may seek to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LME price of primary aluminum and or associated regional premiums through financial instruments designed to limit our downside price risk. Information regarding financial contracts is included in Note 15. Derivatives and risks associated with such financial contracts are disclosed specifically in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We saw a decline in the pricing of aluminum through the third quarter of 2024. The following table summarizes the average price for primary aluminum per tonne for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 compared to the average price for primary aluminum per tonne for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects no change in production capacities. 
 Our net sales are impacted primarily by the LME price for aluminum, regional and value-added premiums, and the volume and product mix of aluminum we ship during the period. In general, our results reflect the LME and regional premium pricing on an approximately one to three month lag basis reflecting contractual terms with our customers.

 Electrical power, alumina, carbon products, labor, and other controllable costs are the principal components of our cost of goods sold. Power costs can be volatile as a result of a number of factors beyond our control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Increases in energy costs may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Power costs at our Kentucky plants are impacted by capacity demand charges, which are determined based on available power generating capacity in MISO, from which we purchase energy. The price of such capacity is set by auction annually in the spring. Our expected capacity demand costs for power were approximately 2 million for the twelve months ending May 31, 2024 , in addition to the market price of power used. We anticipate the capacity demand power costs resulting from the spring 2024 auction for the twelve months ending May 31, 2025 to be approximately 3 million . 
 In 2024, energy prices in the U.S. and Europe have moderated from their previously elevated levels. European energy markets impact our Vlissingen facility in the Netherlands, which utilizes natural gas to produce anodes used in our Grundartangi operations. The energy market in Europe has historically been dependent upon imported natural gas from Russia, and the significant reduction in Russian gas supply to Europe has resulted in increased uncertainty with respect to the price and availability of natural gas. Adverse changes to European natural gas prices or availability could adversely affect operations at Vlissingen, and in turn operations at Grundartangi, if we are not able to source an alternative supply of anodes. 
 In general, our results reflect the market cost of alumina on an approximately three-month lag reflecting the terms of our alumina contracts and inventory levels.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are available cash and cash flows from operations. We also have access to our existing U.S. and Iceland revolving credit facilities (collectively, the revolving credit facilities and have raised capital in the past through public equity and debt markets. Our principal uses of cash include the funding of operating costs (including post-retirement benefits), debt service requirements, capital expenditures, investments in our growth activities and in related businesses, working capital and other general corporate requirements. 
 We believe that cash provided from operations and financing activities will be adequate to cover our operations and business needs over the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 32.6 million and unused availability under our revolving credit facilities of 246.3 million (including 80 million under the Vlissingen Credit Facility referred to below, which expires in December 2026). Our cash and cash equivalents and unused availability under our revolving credit facilities comprise our liquidity position, which was 278.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Available Cash 
 Our available cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2024 was 32.6 million compared to 88.8 million at December 31, 2023.

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our statements of cash flows are summarized below 
 Nine months Ended September 30, 
 (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 16.8 39.6 Net cash used in investing activities (66.8) (17.6) Net cash (used) provided by financing activities (4.9) 17.2 Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (54.9) 39.2 
 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by timing of payments and receipts. 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher cash spend on the purchase of property, plant and equipment in the current year attributable to the Grundartangi casthouse project and Jamalco port repair. Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received cash inflows of 19.4 million from the acquisition of subsidiary, net of cash acquired. 
 The change in net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to reduction in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and Grundartangi Casthouse Facility as well as the repayment of carbon credits. 
 Availability Under Our Credit Facilities 
 Our U.S. revolving credit facility, dated May 2018 (as amended, the U.S. revolving credit facility ), previously provided for borrowings of up to 220.0 million, including up to 110.0 million under a letter of credit sub-facility. In June 2022, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our existing 220.0 million U.S. revolving credit facility, increasing the maximum capacity from 220.0 million to 250.0 million, including up to 150.0 million under a letter of credit sub-facility. The U.S. revolving credit facility matures in June 2027. Any letters of credit issued and outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit facility reduce our borrowing availability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
 We have also entered into, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nordural Grundartangi ehf Grundartangi ), a 50.0 million revolving credit facility, dated November 2013, as amended (the Iceland revolving credit facility ). On February 4, 2022, we amended the Iceland revolving credit facility and increased the facility amount to 80.0 million in the aggregate. On September 28, 2022, we further amended the Iceland revolving credit facility and increased the facility amount to 100.0 million in the aggregate. The Iceland revolving credit facility matures in December 2026. 
 The availability of funds under our credit facilities is limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and qualified cash deposits which meet the lenders' eligibility criteria. Increases in the price of aluminum and or restarts of previously curtailed operations, for example, increase our borrowing base by increasing our accounts receivable and inventory balances decreases in the price of aluminum and or curtailments of production capacity would decrease our borrowing base by reducing our accounts receivable and inventory balances. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. revolving credit facility had a borrowing availability of 149.9 million , outstanding borrowings of 9.6 million , and 74.0 million of outstanding letters of credit with total availability of 66.3 million . Of the outstanding letters of credit, 13.7 million are related to our power commitments, 33.2 million are related to raw materials and the remaining 27.1 million are primarily for the purpose of securing certain debt and workers compensation commitments. As of September 30, 2024, our Iceland revolving credit facility had a borrowing base of 100.0 million and no outstanding borrowings, with total availability of 100.0 million . 
 As of September 30, 2024, our credit facilities had 246.3 million of net availability after consideration of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. We may borrow and make repayments under our credit facilities in the ordinary course based on a number of factors, including the timing of payments from our customers and payments to our suppliers. 
 Our credit facilities contain customary covenants, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, affiliate transactions, liens, dividends and distributions, dispositions of collateral, investments and prepayments of indebtedness, including in the U.S. revolving credit facility, a springing financial covenant that requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 as of any date of determination on which availability under the U.S. revolving credit facility is less than or equal to 25.0 million, or 10 of the borrowing base, but not less than 17.85 million. We intend to maintain

 availability to comply with these levels any time we would not meet the ratio, which could limit our ability to access the full amount of our availability under our U.S revolving credit facility. Our Iceland revolving credit facility contains a covenant that requires Grundartangi to maintain a minimum equity ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants or maintained availability above such covenant triggers.

 Contingent Commitments 
 We have a contingent obligation in connection with the unwind of a contractual arrangement between Century Aluminum of Kentucky CAKY ), Big Rivers Electric Corporation and a third party and the execution in July 2009 of a long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy, a member of a cooperative of Big Rivers. This contingent obligation consists of the aggregate payments made to Big Rivers by the third party on CAKY s behalf in excess of the agreed upon base amount under the long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy. As of September 30, 2024, the principal and accrued interest for the contingent obligation was 32.0 million, which was fully offset by a derivative asset. We may be required to make installment payments for the contingent obligation in the future. These payments are contingent based on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville s operations. As of September 30, 2024, based on the LME forward market prices and our expected level of Hawesville operations, we believe that we will not be required to make payments on the contingent obligation during the term of the agreement, which expires in 2028. There can be no assurance that circumstances will not change thus accelerating the timing of such payments. 
 Employee Benefit Plan Contributions 
 In 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC regarding an alleged cessation of operations at our Ravenswood facility (the PBGC Settlement Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the PBGC Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our

 defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately 17.4 million. Under certain circumstances, in periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations, we were able to defer one or more of these payments, provided that we provide the PBGC with acceptable security for such deferred payments. We historically elected to defer certain payments under the PBGC Settlement Agreement and provided the PBGC with the appropriate security. In October 2021, we amended the PBGC Settlement Agreement (the Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement such that we removed the deferral mechanism and agreed to contribute approximately 2.4 million per year to our defined benefit pension plans for a total of approximately 9.6 million, over four years beginning on November 30, 2022 and ending on November 30, 2025, subject to acceleration if certain terms and conditions are met in such amendment. As of September 30, 2024, we made contributions of 7.2 million rela ted to the Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement. We did not make any contributions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2024. 
 Section 232 Aluminum Tariff 
 On March 23, 2018, the U.S. implemented a 10 tariff on imported primary aluminum products into the U.S. These tariffs are intended to protect U.S. national security and incentivize the restart of primary aluminum production in the U.S., reducing reliance on imports and ensuring that domestic producers, like Century, can supply all the aluminum necessary for critical industries and national defense. In addition to primary aluminum products, the tariffs also cover certain other semi-finished products. All imports that directly compete with our products are covered by the tariff, with the exception of imports from Australia, Canada and Mexico. Additionally, primary aluminum imports from Argentina are allowed up to an annual quota limit of 169,000 metric tonnes, the first 18,000 metric tonnes of imports from the European Union and the first 900 metric tonnes of imports from the United Kingdom are also allowed duty free. Imports that receive a product exclusion from the Department of Commerce may also enter the US duty free. In July 2022, the International Trade Commission (ITC) initiated a review of the Section 301 and 232 duties as required by law every four years. 
 On March 15, 2023, the ITC submitted a report to the United States Congress entitled, 'Economic Impact of Section 232 and 301 Tariffs on U.S. Industries,' in which the ITC found that the tariffs increased the production of domestic aluminum while causing prices to increase by less than two percent. Accordingly, we do not believe there will be any material changes to the current tariffs in the near future. 
 Section 301 Tariffs 
 On May 22, 2024, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) issued a proposal (the Proposal to implement new 
 tariffs on certain items and increase existing tariffs on other items imported from China pursuant to USTR s authority under 
 Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The new and increased tariffs were adopted pursuant to the USTR s authority to 
 investigate unfair trade barriers and impose measures to counteract a foreign country s unfair or discriminatory trade practices. 
 Under the Proposal, tariffs on aluminum imported from China are expected to increase to 25 from the current 7.5 tariff 
 imposed in 2018. The increased tariff is in addition to the 10 tariff imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The new and increased Section 301 tariffs are only applicable to imports with China as the country of origin. 
 Other Items 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed the IRA into law. The IRA provides for substantial tax credits and incentives for the development of critical minerals (including aluminum), renewable energy, clean fuels, electric vehicles, and supporting infrastructure, among other provisions. Section 45X of the IRA contains a production tax credit equal to 10 of certain eligible production costs, including, without limitation, labor, energy, depreciation and amortization and overhead expenses. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final rules to provide guidance on the production tax credit requirements under Internal Revenue Code Section 45X (the Proposed Regulations ). The Final Regulations provide guidance on rules that taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the Section 45X tax credit. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 47.3 million and 69.9 million as a reduction in Cost of goods sold and 0.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively, as a reduction in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in an equally offsetting receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recognized a Manufacturing credit receivable of 78.8 million and 59.3 million, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024, we recognized a Non-current Manufacturing credit receivable of 52.4 million within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 During 2021, we announced plans for construction of a new billet casthouse at Grundartangi. The Grundartangi casthouse project began in late 2021 and was completed during the second quarter of 2024. The Grundartangi casthouse project was funded primarily through the Casthouse Facility. The project is complete and billets have started to ship from the casthouse in the second half of 2024.

 In 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a 60.0 million common stock repurchase program and during the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors increased the size of the program by 70.0 million. Under the program, Century is authorized to repurchase up to 130.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, from time to time, on the open market at prevailing market prices, in block trades or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and other factors. We made no repurchases during the years ended 2021, 2022, and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had 43.7 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization. The repurchase program may be expanded, suspended or discontinued by our Board, in its sole discretion, at any time. 
 In November 2009, Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. CAWV filed a class action complaint for declaratory judgment against the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union USW ), the USW s local and certain CAWV retirees, individually and as class representatives CAWV Retirees ), seeking a declaration of CAWV s rights to modify terminate retiree medical benefits. Later in November 2009, the USW and representatives of a retiree class filed a separate suit against CAWV, Century Aluminum Company, Century Aluminum Master Welfare Benefit Plan, and various John Does with respect to the foregoing. On August 18, 2017, the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia approved a settlement agreement in respect of these actions, pursuant to which, CAWV agreed to make payments into a trust for the benefit of the CAWV Retirees in the aggregate amount of 23.0 million over the course of ten years. Upon approval of the settlement, we paid 5.0 million to the aforementioned trust in September 2017 and agreed to pay the remaining amounts under the settlement agreement in annual increments of 2.0 million for nine years. At September 30, 2024, we had 2.0 million in other current liabilities and 1.5 million in other liabilities related to this agreement. 
 We are a defendant in several actions relating to various aspects of our business. While it is impossible to predict the ultimate disposition of any litigation, we do not believe that any of these lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information. 
 Capital Resources 
 We intend to finance our future capital expenditures from available cash, cash flows from operations and if necessary, borrowing under our existing revolving credit facilities. For major investment projects we would likely seek financing from various capital and loan markets and may potentially pursue the formation of strategic alliances. We may be unable, however, to issue additional debt or equity securities, or enter into other financing arrangements on attractive terms, or at all, due to a number of factors including a lack of demand, unfavorable pricing, poor economic conditions, unfavorable interest rates, or our financial condition or credit rating at the time. Future uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to access the debt or capital markets and our financial condition. 
 Capital expenditures incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 35.3 million, including expenditures related to the Jamalco port repair, but excludes expenditures of 33.8 million associated with the Grundartangi casthouse project. We estimate our total remaining capital spending in 2024 will be approximately 10 to 15 million, related to our ongoing investment and sustainability projects at our aluminum smelters and alumina refinery.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Commodity Price and Raw Material Costs Sensitivities 
 Aluminum is an internationally traded commodity, and its price is effectively determined on the LME plus any regional premium (e.g. the Midwest premium for aluminum sold in the United States and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe) and any value-added product premiums. From time to time, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LME price of primary aluminum and or associated regional premiums through financial instruments designed to protect our downside price risk exposure. From time to time, we also enter into financial contracts to offset fixed price sales arrangements with certain of our customers (the fixed for floating swaps ). 
 We are also exposed to price risk for alumina which is one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. Certain portions of the alumina we purchase is priced based on a published alumina index. As a result, our cost structure is exposed to market fluctuations and price volatility. Because we sell our products based principally on the LME price for primary aluminum, regional premiums and value-added product premiums, we are not able to directly pass on increased production costs to our customers. From time to time, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in our alumina costs by purchasing certain of our alumina requirements under supply contracts with prices tied to the same indices as our aluminum sales contracts (the LME price of primary aluminum). 
 Market-Based Power Price Sensitivity 
 Market-Based Electrical Power Agreements 
 Hawesville and Sebree have a market-based electrical power agreement pursuant to which Kenergy purchases electrical power on the open market and passes it through at MISO energy pricing, plus transmission and other costs incurred by them. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information about these market-based power agreements. 
 Power is supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements. These power purchase agreements, which will expire on various dates from 2026 through 2036 (subject to extension), currently provide power at LME-based variable rates for 70 of Grundartangi's power requirements. The remaining 30 of Grundartangi's power requirements is primarily at fixed rates plus a small variable rate portion. 
 From time to time, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in the market price of power through financial instruments designed to protect our downside risk exposure. 
 Electrical Power Price Sensitivity 
 Given our market-based power supply agreements, we have electrical power price risk for our operations, whether due to fluctuations in the price of power available on the MISO power market or the price of natural gas. Power represents one of our largest operating costs, so changes in the price and or availability of market power could significantly impact the profitability and viability of our operations. Transmission line outages, problems with grid stability or limitations on energy import capability could also increase power prices, disrupt production through pot instability or force a curtailment of all or part of the production at these facilities. In addition, indirect factors that lead to power cost increases, such as any increasing prices for natural gas or coal, fluctuations in or extremes in weather patterns or new or more stringent environmental regulations may severely impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

 Foreign Currency 
 We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the Icelandic krona ISK ), the Euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Jamaican dollar and other currencies. Grundartangi s labor costs, part of its maintenance costs and other local services are denominated in ISK and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in Euros and Chinese renminbi. We also have deposits denominated in ISK in Icelandic banks and our estimated payments of Icelandic income taxes and any associated refunds are denominated in ISK. Vlissingen's labor costs, maintenance costs, and other local services are denominated in Euros. Further, Jamalco's labor costs, maintenance costs, and other local services are denominated in Jamaican dollars. We also have deposits denominated in Jamaican dollars in Jamaican banks and our estimated payments of Jamaican income taxes and any associated refunds are denominated in Jamaican dollars. As a result, an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would affect Grundartangi s, Vlissingen's and Jamalco's operating margins. 
 We may manage our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts or option contracts for forecasted transactions and projected cash flows for foreign currencies in future periods. We have entered into financial contracts to hedge the risk of fluctuations associated with the ISK and Euro under our casthouse currency hedges. 
 Natural Economic Hedges 
 Any analysis of our exposure to the commodity price of aluminum should consider the impact of natural hedges provided by certain contracts that contain pricing indexed to the LME price for primary aluminum. Certain alumina contracts and a substantial portion of Grundartangi s electrical power requirements are indexed to the LME price for primary aluminum and provide a natural hedge for a portion of our production. 
 Risk Management 
 Any metals, power, natural gas and foreign currency risk management activities are subject to the control and direction of senior management within guidelines established by Century s Board of Directors. These activities are regularly reported to Century s Board of Directors.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 
 Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 ITRA ), effective August 10, 2012, added a new subsection (r) to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers that file periodic reports with the SEC to disclose in their annual and quarterly reports whether, during the reporting period, they or any of their affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to Iran, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable laws. Issuers must also file a notice with the SEC if any disclosable activity under ITRA has been included in an annual or quarterly report. 
 Because the SEC defines the term affiliate broadly, our largest stockholder may be considered an affiliate of the Company despite the fact that the Company has no control over its largest stockholder s actions or the actions of its affiliates. As such, pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Exchange Act, the Company hereby discloses the following information provided by our largest stockholder regarding transactions or dealings with entities controlled by the Government of Iran the GOI 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, non-U.S. affiliates of the largest stockholder of the Company the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates entered into sales contracts for agricultural products with, or for delivery to or from Iranian entities wholly or majority owned by the GOI. The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates performed their obligations under the contracts in compliance with applicable sanction laws and, where required, with the necessary prior approvals by the relevant governmental authorities. 
 The gross revenue of the non-U.S Stockholder Affiliates related to the contracts did not exceed the value of U SD 74 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates do not allocate net profit on a country-by-country or activity-by-activity basis, but estimate that the net profit attributable to the contracts would not exceed a small fraction of the gross revenue from such contracts. It is not possible to determine accurately the precise net profit attributable to such contracts. 
 The contracts disclosed above do not violate applicable sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and are not the subject of any enforcement action under Iran sanction laws. 
 The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates expect to continue to engage in similar activities in the future in compliance with applicable economic sanctions and in conformity with U.S. secondary sanctions. 
 The Company and its global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under ITRA, nor were we involved in the transactions described in this section. As of the date of this report, the Company is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by it or any of its affiliates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act. 
 Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Officers 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company who is required to file reports under Section 16 of the Exchange Act has informed us that he or she has adopted, modified, or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
