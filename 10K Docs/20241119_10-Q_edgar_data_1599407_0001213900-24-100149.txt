, restricted cash of and total working capital deficit of . For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an operating loss of and used cash flows in operating activities from continuing
operations of . 

The
Company has generated operating losses since its inception and has relied on cash on hand, sales of securities, external bank lines of
credit, and issuance of third-party and related party debt to support cashflows from operations. The Company expects that within the
next twelve months, it will not have sufficient cash and other resources on hand to sustain its current operations or meet its obligations
as they become due unless it obtains additional financing. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

An
assessment was performed to determine whether there were conditions or events that, considered in the aggregate, raised substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the condensed consolidated financial statements
are issued. Initially, this assessment did not consider the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that had not been
fully implemented. Based on this assessment, substantial doubt exists regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management
plans to address these concerns by securing additional financing through debt and equity offerings. Management assessed the mitigating
effect of its plans to determine if it is probable that the plans would be effectively implemented within one year after the consolidated
financial statements are issued and when implemented, would mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These plans are subject to market conditions and reliance on third parties,
and there is no assurance that effective implementation of the Company s plans will result in the necessary funding to continue
current operations and satisfy current debt obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern beyond one year from the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and their carrying amounts,
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. If the
Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

Private
Placement of OID Promissory Note and Warrants 

On
May 8, 2024, the Company entered into securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company issued
to such investor (i) a 20 OID subordinated note in the principal amount of and (ii) five -year warrants for the purchase of
 common shares at an adjusted exercise price of per share (subject to standard adjustments as defined in the warrant) for
total cash proceeds of . 

Additionally,
the Company issued a five -year warrant to the placement agent, Spartan Capital Securities, LLC Spartan ), for the purchase
of common shares at an adjusted exercise price of per share (subject to standard adjustments as defined in the warrant agreement).
The warrants are exercisable at any time six months after the date of issuance. 

The
Company may voluntarily prepay the note in full at any time. In addition, if the Company consummates any sale of a material amount of
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, then the net proceeds thereof shall be applied to the payment or prepayment of the
note. The note is unsecured and has priority over all other unsecured indebtedness of the Company, except for certain senior indebtedness
(as defined in the note). The note contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for a loan of this type.
Upon an event of default, the outstanding balance of the note will be assessed a penalty. 

The note becomes convertible into common shares
at the option of the holder at any time on or following the date that an event of default (as defined in the note agreement) occurs under
the note at a conversion price equal to of the lowest volume weighted average price of the Company s common shares on any trading
day during the five ) trading days prior to the conversion date; provided that such conversion price shall not be less than per
share.

Company evaluated the embedded features within this note in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815. The Company determined that the embedded
features, specifically (i) the default penalty of on outstanding principal and accrued interest, and (ii) the conversion option into
common shares at of the lowest volume weighted average price in the five days preceding conversion, subject to a floor price,
constitute derivative liabilities. These features, arising from default provisions not within the Company s control, including
the contingent interest feature and the contingent conversion (deemed redemption) feature, meet the definition of a derivative and do
not qualify for derivative accounting exemptions. Consequently, these embedded features are bifurcated from the debt host and recognized
as a single derivative liability. 

The
initial fair value of the derivative liabilities was determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model, considering various potential
outcomes and scenarios. The model used the following assumptions: (i) dividend yield of ; (ii) expected volatility of ; (iii)
risk-free interest rate of ; (iv) term of months; (v) estimated fair value of the common shares of per share; and (vi)
various probability assumptions. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of operations each reporting period.
The issuance costs for the promissory note, along with the allocated fair values of both the warrants and the bifurcated embedded derivative
liability, have been collectively treated as a debt discount. This discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the
promissory note using the effective interest method. 

On
September 26, 2024, the parties entered in an amendment to the note to (i) increase the original issue discount to , (ii) increase
the principal amount to , (iii) increase the default amount (as defined in the note) to and (iv) extend the maturity date
to November 30, 2024. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded amortization of debt discount and recognized a loss on extinguishment

Manager s Profit Allocation (Distribution
Receivable) 

The Manager owns of the allocation shares
of the Company which represent the original equity interest in the Company. As a holder of the allocation shares, the Manager is entitled
to receive a profit allocation as a form of preferred distribution, pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of
certain events. Generally, the distribution of the profit allocation is paid upon the occurrence of the sale of a material amount of
capital stock or assets of one of the Company s businesses, including if the Company distributes its equity ownership in a subsidiary
to the Company s shareholders in a spin-off or similar transaction (a Sale Event ), or, at the option of the Manager,
at the five-year anniversary date of the acquisition of one of the Company s businesses (a Holding Event ). The calculation
of the profit allocation and the rights of the Manager, as the holder of the allocation shares, are governed by the operating agreement.
The Company records distributions of the profit allocation to the holders upon occurrence of a Sale Event or Holding Event as dividends
declared on allocation interests to shareholders equity when they are approved by the Company s board of directors. 

Prior to the sale of High Mountain, the last
occurrence of profit allocation distribution to the Manager by the Company was during the fourth quarter of 2020, concurrent with the
spin-off of a former subsidiary. Following the profit allocation distribution to the Manager, the board of directors identified a need
to adjust the distribution to the Manager, which resulted in the recognition of a million distribution receivable from the Manager
within shareholders equity, with repayment anticipated upon the occurrence of the next qualified profit allocation distribution
event (the Distribution Receivable ). 

On April 23, 2024, the Company and the Manager

Overview 

We are an acquisition holding company focused
on acquiring and managing a group of small businesses, which we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than 50
million, in a variety of different industries headquartered in North America. 

On September 30, 2020, our subsidiary 1847 Cabinet
Inc., or 1847 Cabinet, acquired Kyle s Custom Wood Shop, Inc., an Idaho corporation, or Kyle s. Kyle s is a leading
custom cabinetry maker servicing contractors and homeowners since 1976 in Boise, Idaho and the surrounding area. Kyle s focuses
on designing, building, and installing custom cabinetry primarily for custom and semi-custom builders. 

On March 30, 2021, our subsidiary 1847 Wolo Inc.,
or 1847 Wolo, acquired Wolo Mfg. Corp., a New York corporation, and Wolo Industrial Horn Signal, Inc., a New York corporation (which
we collectively refer to as Wolo). Headquartered in Deer Park, New York and founded in 1965, Wolo designs and sells horn and safety products
(electric, air, truck, marine, motorcycle and industrial equipment), and offers vehicle emergency and safety warning lights for cars,
trucks, industrial equipment and emergency vehicles. 

On October 8, 2021, our subsidiary 1847 Cabinet
acquired High Mountain Door Trim Inc., a Nevada corporation, or High Mountain, which we subsequently sold on September 30, 2024
(see Discontinued Operations below), and Sierra Homes, LLC d/b/a Innovative Cabinets Design, a Nevada
limited liability company, or Innovative Cabinets. Innovative Cabinets is headquartered in Reno, Nevada and was founded in 2008. It specializes
in custom cabinetry and countertops for a client base consisting of single-family homeowners, builders of multi-family homes, as well
as commercial clients. 

Through our structure, we offer investors an
opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by
private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or large conglomerates. We believe that our management
and acquisition strategies will allow us to achieve our goals to make and grow regular distributions to our common shareholders
and increase common shareholder value over time. 

We seek to acquire controlling interests in small
businesses that we believe operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, and that have positive and stable
earnings and cash flows, face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence and have strong management teams largely in
place. We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their businesses will consider us to be an attractive
purchaser of their businesses. We make these businesses our majority-owned subsidiaries and actively manage and grow such businesses.
We expect to improve our businesses over the long term through organic growth opportunities, add-on acquisitions and operational improvements.

company increased by 916,884, or 93.8 , to 1,893,920 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 977,036 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Such increase was primarily attributed to management fees from the sale of High Mountain that entitles our manager
to receive a 20 profit allocation, or 875,000, and a transaction fee of 2.0 , or 340,000, offset by decreased software and office expenditures. 

Professional fees . Our total professional
fees were 4,435,727 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,081,997 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

Professional fees for the construction segment
decreased by 33,721, or 30.8 , to 75,830 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 109,551 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Such decrease was primarily attributed to decreased consulting fees. As a percentage of construction revenue, professional
fees for the construction segment were 0.9 and 1.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Professional fees for the automotive supplies
segment increased by 52,450, or 34.5 , to 204,608 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 152,158 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. Such increase was primarily attributed to increased consulting fees. As a percentage of automotive supplies revenue,
professional fees for the automotive supplies segment were 5.3 and 4.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Professional fees for our holding company increased
by 3,335,001, or 406.6 , to 4,155,289 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 820,288 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Such increase was primarily attributed to increased consulting fees, investor relations, and other public company related fees.
Additionally, during the 2024 period we prepaid 2.5 million in non-recurring consulting and investor relations fees using the proceeds
from the public offering described below. Of this amount, 2.4 million was expensed to professional fees for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets .
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded goodwill impairments of 679,175, as compared to no impairments for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Total other income (expense) . We
had 11,702,618 in total other expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net, of 7,376,576
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of consisted
of other expense of 1,277,446, interest expense of 3,135,373, amortization of debt discounts of 7,976,758 and loss on extinguishment
of debt of 2,843,451, offset by a gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 1,841,000 and a gain on change in fair value
of derivative liabilities of 1,689,410. Other expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of interest expense
of 3,973,783, amortization of debt discounts of 3,808,269, and a loss on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 27,900, offset
by other income of 7,399 and a gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 425,977. 

Income tax benefit . We
had an income tax benefit of 751,000 and 269,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Net loss from continuing operations .
As a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, we had a net loss from continuing operations of 19,511,958 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10,087,096 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents of 1,517,191 and restricted cash and cash equivalents of 8,700,000. To date, we have financed our operations primarily
through revenue generated from operations, cash proceeds from financing activities, borrowings, and equity contributions by our shareholders. 

Management plans to address the above as needed
by, securing additional bank lines of credit, and obtaining additional financing through debt or equity transactions. Management has
implemented tight cost controls to conserve cash. 

The ability of our company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and to eventually attain
profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if our
company is unable to continue as a going concern. If our company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 

48 

We believe additional funds are required to execute
our business plan and our strategy of acquiring additional businesses. The funds required to execute our business plan will depend on
the size, capital structure and purchase price consideration that the seller of a target business deems acceptable in a given transaction.
The amount of funds needed to execute our business plan also depends on what portion of the purchase price of a target business the seller
of that business is willing to take in the form of seller notes or our equity or equity in one of our subsidiaries. We will seek growth
as funds become available from cash flow, borrowings, additional capital raised privately or publicly, or seller retained financing. 

Our primary use of funds will be for future acquisitions,
public company expenses including regular distributions to our shareholders, investments in future acquisitions, payments to our manager
pursuant to the management services agreement, potential payment of profit allocation to our manager and potential put price to our manager
in respect of the allocation shares it owns. The management fee, expenses, potential profit allocation and potential put price are paid
before distributions to shareholders and may be significant and exceed the funds we hold, which may require us to dispose of assets or
incur debt to fund such expenditures. See Item 1. Business Our Manager included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information concerning the management fee, the profit allocation and put price. 

The amount of management fee paid to our manager
by us is reduced by the aggregate amount of any offsetting management fees, if any, received by our manager from any of our businesses.
As a result, the management fee paid to our manager may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The amount of management fee paid to our manager
may represent a significant cash obligation. In this respect, the payment of the management fee will reduce the amount of cash available
for distribution to shareholders. 

Our manager, as holder of 100 of our allocation
shares, is entitled to receive a twenty percent (20 profit allocation as a form of preferred equity distribution, subject to an annual
hurdle rate of eight percent (8 ), as follows. Upon the sale of a subsidiary, our manager will be paid a profit allocation if the sum
of (i) the excess of the gain on the sale of such subsidiary over a high-water mark plus (ii) the subsidiary s net income since
its acquisition by us exceeds the 8 hurdle rate. The 8 hurdle rate is the product of (i) a 2 rate per quarter, multiplied by (ii)
the number of quarters such subsidiary was held by us, multiplied by (iii) the subsidiary s average share (determined based on
gross assets, generally) of our consolidated net equity (determined according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP,
with certain adjustments). In certain circumstances, after a subsidiary has been held for at least 5 years, our manager may also trigger
a profit allocation with respect to such subsidiary (determined based solely on the subsidiary s net income since its acquisition).
The amount of profit allocation may represent a significant cash payment and is senior in right to payments of distributions to our shareholders.
Therefore, the amount of profit allocation paid, when paid, will reduce the amount of cash available to us for our operating and investing
activities, including future acquisitions. See Item 1. Business Our Manager Our Manager as an Equity Holder Manager s
Profit Allocation included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information on the
calculation of the profit allocation. 

Prior to the sale of High Mountain, the last occurrence
of profit allocation distribution to our manager by our company was during the fourth quarter of 2020, concurrent with the spin-off of
a former subsidiary. Following the profit allocation distribution to our manager, our board of directors identified a need to adjust the
distribution to our manager, which resulted in the recognition of a 2 million distribution receivable from our manager within shareholders 
equity, with repayment anticipated upon the occurrence of the next qualified profit allocation distribution event. 

On April 23, 2024, we and our manager entered
into a letter agreement regarding the timing of payment of the distribution receivable, pursuant to which the parties agreed to treat
the distribution receivable as a 2,000,000, plus interest accrued thereon at a non-compounding rate equal to the applicable federal
rate, unqualified obligation of our manager to be repaid as a credit against all future profit allocations resulting from both a sale
event and a holding event payable to our manager, all until the distribution receivable is fully paid, provided that, if the distribution
receivable is not fully paid by the application of such credit or otherwise by the first to occur of (i) December 31, 2024 and (ii) the
date of the sale of all or substantially all the assets (in a transaction of any form) or the liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
voluntary or involuntary, of either party, then upon such date the unpaid balance shall be immediately due, payable and paid by our manager. 

The sale of High Mountain qualified as a sale
event that entitles our manager to receive a 20 profit allocation, or 875,000, in accordance with the profit allocation formula outlined
in the operating agreement. Additionally, our manager is entitled to receive a transaction fee of 2.0 , or 340,000. The profit allocation
and transaction fee were applied as a credit to the distribution receivable, leaving a balance of 785,000 as of September 30, 2024. 

Our operating agreement also contains a supplemental
put provision, which gives our manager the right, subject to certain conditions, to cause us to purchase the allocation shares then owned
by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement. The amount of put price under the supplemental put provision is
determined by assuming all of our subsidiaries are sold at that time for their fair market value and then calculating the amount of profit
allocation would be payable in such a case. If the management services agreement is terminated for any reason other than our manager s
resignation, the payment to our manager could be as much as twice the amount of such hypothetical profit allocation. As is the case with
profit allocation, the calculation of the put price is complex and based on many factors that cannot be predicted with any certainty
at this time. See Item 1. Business Our Manager Our Manager as an Equity Holder Supplemental Put Provision 
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information on the calculation of the put price.
The put price obligation, if our manager exercises its put right, will represent a significant cash payment and is senior in right to
payments of distributions to our shareholders. Therefore, the amount of put price will reduce the amount of cash available to us for
our operating and investing activities, including future acquisitions.

Summary of Cash Flow 

The following table provides detailed information
about our net cash flows from continuing operations for the periods indicated:

 452,284 

Net cash used in operating activities from continuing
operations was 11,688,488 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7,953,559 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Significant factors affecting the increase in net cash used in operating activities were primarily a result of the net loss
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased contract liabilities and accounts payable, and increased receivables, partially
offset by expenses, and decreased inventories and prepaid expenses. 

Net cash provided by investing activities from
continuing operations was 17,501,868 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing activities
of 17,160 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily
a result of the proceeds received from the sale of High Mountain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net cash provided by financing activities from
continuing operations was 3,730,366 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7,561,785 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of decreased proceeds in private
placements and increased debt repayments, offset by increased proceeds from public offerings. 

Public Offering 

On February 9, 2024, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement with certain purchasers and a placement agency agreement with Spartan, as placement agent, pursuant to which we agreed
to issue and sell to such purchasers an aggregate of 9,364 common shares and prefunded warrants for the purchase of 16,280 common shares
at an offering price of 195.00 per common share and 193.05 per prefunded warrant, pursuant to our effective registration statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-276670). On February 14, 2024, the closing of this offering was completed. At the closing, the purchasers prepaid
the exercise price of the prefunded warrants in full. Therefore, we received total gross proceeds of 5,000,000. Pursuant to the placement
agency agreement, Spartan received a cash transaction fee equal to 8 of the aggregate gross proceeds and reimbursement of certain
out-of-pocket expenses. After deducting these and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately 4,335,000. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued an aggregate of 16,275 common shares upon the exercise of prefunded warrants. 

Debt 

The following table shows aggregate figures for
our total debt that is coming due in the short and long term as of September 30, 2024. For a complete description of the terms of our
outstanding debt, please see Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements above and Notes 10, 12, 13 and 14 to our consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

Contractual Obligations 

Our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations
under the loans described above and other contractual commitments described below. 

We have engaged our manager to manage our day-to-day
operations and affairs. Our relationship with our manager will be governed principally by t he
following agreements: 

the
 management services agreement and offsetting management services agreements relating to the
 management services our manager will perform for us and the businesses we own and the management
 fee to be paid to our manager in respect thereof; and 

our
 operating agreement setting forth our manager s rights with respect to the allocation
 shares it owns, including the right to receive profit allocations from us, and the supplemental
 put provision relating to our manager s right to cause us to purch ase the allocation
 shares it owns. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates.
These estimates are based on management s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

For a description of the accounting policies
that, in management s opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment or involve complex estimation and which could,
if different judgment or estimates were made, materially affect our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows,
see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result of this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material
weaknesses described below. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, believes the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly represent, in all material respects,
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We regularly review our system of internal control
over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that
we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

During its evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, our management identi fied
the following material weaknesses: 

we
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures, including
 written policies and procedures to ensure the correct application of accounting and financial
 reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; 

we
 failed to maintain a sufficient complement of personnel in our accounting and reporting department
 to ensure adequate segregation of duties such that appropriate review and monitoring of its
 financial records are executed; and 

we
 did not design and maintain effective internal controls related to our information technology
 general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information
 technology systems that support our financial reporting processes. 

As
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our management has identified the steps necessary
to address the material weaknesses, and in the second quarter of 2024, we continued to implement the following remedial procedures: 

increasing
 personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function; 

until
 we have sufficient technical accounting resources, we have engaged external consultants to
 provide support and to assist us in our evaluation of more complex applications of GAAP; 

engaging
 internal control consultants to assist us in performing a financial reporting risk assessment
 as well as identifying and designing our system of internal controls necessary to mitigate
 the risks identified; and 

preparation
 of written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. 

We
continue to enh ance corporate oversight over process-level controls and structures to ensure that there is appropriate assignment
of authority, responsibility, and accountability to enable remediation of our material weaknesses. We believe that our remediation plan
will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. As we
continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional measures
to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. 

Other than in connection with the implementation
of the remedial measures described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the second quarter
of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may become involved in
various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,

of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating
results.
