million asset-based lending facility ("ABL Facility") in place with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the arranging agent and BMO Harris Bank, N.A. as a one - third syndicated participant. The ABL Facility matures on May 19, 2026 and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Company can elect borrowings on a floating rate basis or a term basis. Floating rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the prime rate minus per annum. Term rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the SOFR rate applicable to the selected term plus per annum. Availability of funds under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation determined as the sum of (a) of eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) the product of multiplied by the net orderly liquidating value percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by eligible inventory. The ABL Facility contains a springing financial covenant whereby the financial covenant is only tested when availability falls below the greater of of the revolving commitment or million. The financial covenant restricts the Company from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio to be, as of the end of any calendar month, less than to 1.00 for the trailing twelve -month period then ending. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of (a) EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, minus unfinanced capital expenditures to (b) cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments on indebtedness plus taxes paid in cash plus restricted payments paid in cash plus capital lease obligation payments plus cash contributions to any employee pension benefit plans. The ABL Facility contains other representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary. If certain conditions precedent are satisfied, the ABL facility may be increased by up to an aggregate of million, in minimum increments of million. At September 30, 2024 , the Company had a balance of approximately million under the ABL Facility with an applicable interest rate of . At September 30, 2024 , the Company's applicable borrowing base calculation supported access to approximately million of the ABL Facility.

shares. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, select the employees, directors or consultants to whom awards will be granted and shall determine the amount and applicable restrictions of each award. Restricted awards entitle recipients to vote and receive non-forfeitable dividends during the restriction period. Because dividends are non-forfeitable, they are reflected in retained earnings. Forfeitures are accounted for upon their occurrence. Because the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur, the non-forfeitable dividends are reclassified from retained earnings to additional stock compensation for the actual forfeitures that occurred.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Friedman Industries, Incorporated is a manufacturer and processor of steel products and operates in two reportable segments: flat-roll products and tubular products. 
 
 The flat-roll product segment consists of the operation of five hot-rolled coil processing facilities located in Hickman, Arkansas Decatur, Alabama East Chicago, Indiana Granite City, Illinois and Sinton, Texas. The Hickman, Granite City and East Chicago facilities operate temper mills and cut-to-length lines. The Decatur and Sinton facilities operate stretcher leveler cut-to-length lines. The equipment at all locations improve the flatness and surface quality of the coils and cut the coils into sheet and plate of prescribed lengths. On a combined basis, the facilities are capable of cutting sheet and plate with thicknesses ranging from 16 gauge to 1 thick in widths ranging from 36 wide to 96 wide. The vast majority of flat-roll product segment revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory but the segment also generates revenue from the processing or storage of customer owned coils on a fee basis. 
 
 The tubular product segment consists of the Company s Texas Tubular Products division TTP located in Lone Star, Texas. TTP operates two electric resistance welded pipe mills with a combined outside diameter OD size range of 2 3/8 OD to 8 5/8 OD. Both pipe mills are American Petroleum Institute API licensed to manufacture line pipe and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. All of the tubular segment's revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory.

Results of Operations 
 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 period ), sales, cost of materials sold and adjusted gross profit decreased approximately 46.7 million, 33.3 million and 13.4 million , respectively, compared to the amounts recorded during the six months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 period ). The decrease in sales was associated with both a decline in sales volume and a decrease in the average selling price per ton. Sales volume for the 2024 period consisted of approximately 240,000 tons from inventory and another 42,000 tons of toll processing customer owned material compared to the 2023 period volume consisting of approximately 258,000 tons from inventory and 50,000 tons of toll processing. The decline in sales volume for the 2024 period was related to a combination of challenging conditions for some of our customers and extended planned downtime for equipment upgrades and maintenance at the Company's Sinton and Decatur facilities. Adjusted gross profit was approximately 36.7 million for the 2024 period compared to approximately 50.1 million for the 2023 period. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales was approximately 16.6 for the 2024 period compared to approximately 18.7 for the 2023 period. 
 
 Our operating results are significantly impacted by the market price of hot-rolled steel coil ("HRC"). Entering the 2023 period, HRC prices had increased approximately 95 from November 2022 to April 2023. HRC prices then declined approximately 18 by the end of the 2023 period. As a result, the 2023 period benefitted from strong physical margins during the first half of the period and then experienced margin compression during the second half of the period. Entering the 2024 period, HRC prices were on a predominately declining trend dropping approximately 40 from January 2024 through the middle of August 2024. As a result, the Company experienced compressed physical margins throughout the 2024 period. The Company utilizes HRC futures to partially manage exposure to commodity price risk. The Company recognized hedging related gains of approximately 5.6 million and 4.8 million in the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. 
 
 Flat-roll Segment 
 
 Flat-roll product segment sales for the 2024 period totaled approximately 200.8 million compared to approximately 245.7 million for the 2023 period. For a more complete understanding of the average selling prices of goods sold, it is helpful to exclude any sales generated from processing or storage of customer owned material. Sales generated from processing or storage of customer owned material totaled approximately 2.7 million for the 2024 period compared to approximately 2.6 million for the 2023 period. Sales generated from flat-roll segment inventory totaled approximately 198.1 million for the 2024 period compared to approximately 243.1 million for the 2023 period. The average per ton selling price related to these shipments decreased from approximately 1,011 per ton in the 2023 period to approximately 895 per ton in the 2024 period. Sales volume for the 2024 period consisted of approximately 221,500 tons from inventory and another 42,000 tons of toll processing customer owned material compared to the 2023 period volume consisting of approximately 241,000 tons from inventory and 50,000 tons of toll processing. The decline in sales volume for the 2024 quarter was related to a combination of challenging conditions for some of our customers and extended planned downtime for equipment upgrades and maintenance at the Company's Sinton and Decatur facilities. Flat-roll segment operations recorded operating profits of approximately 5.3 million and 15.0 million for the 2024 period and 2023 period, respectively. 
 
 The Company s flat-roll segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 
 Tubular Segment 
 
 Tubular product segment sales for the 2024 period totaled approximately 20.5 million compared to approximately 22.3 million for the 2023 period. Sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price per ton from approximately 1,290 per ton for the 2023 period to approximately 1,087 per ton for the 2024 quarter. Tons sold increased from approximately 17,500 tons in the 2023 period to approximately 19,000 tons in the 2024 period. The tubular segment recorded an operating loss of approximately 1.8 million for t he 2024 period compared to recording operating profit of approximately 2.3 million for the 2023 period. 
 
 The tubular segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 

General, Selling and Administrative Costs 

During the 2024 period, selling, general and administrative costs decreased approximately 2.2 million compared to the 2023 period. This decrease is primarily related to lower incentive compensation expense due to the lower earnings in the 2024 period.

Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes decreased from a provision for the 2023 period of approximately 3.7 million to a provision for the 2024 period of approximately 0.5 million. This decrease was primarily related to lower earnings before taxes for the 2024 period. The income tax provision as a percentage of earnings before tax was approximately 21.1 and 24.9 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 , the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due primarily to the inclusion of state tax expenses in the provision with this impact partially reduced by the tax effect of restricted stock vesting during the period. For the six months ended September 30, 2023 , the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due primarily to the inclusion of state tax expenses in the provision.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 quarter ), sales, cost of materials sold and adjusted gross profit decreased approximately 24.0 million, 21.5 million and 2.5 million , respectively, compared to the amounts recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 quarter ). The decrease in sales was associated with both a decline in sales volume and a decrease in the average selling price per ton. Sales volume for the 2024 quarter consisted of approximately 121,500 tons from inventory and another 18,000 tons of toll processing customer owned material compared to the 2023 quarter volume consisting of approximately 129,500 tons from inventory and 26,000 tons of toll processing. The decline in sales volume for the 2024 quarter was related to a combination of weaker demand among some customers and hesitancy among others given the political uncertainty at the time. Adjusted gross profit was approximately 18.0 million for the 2024 quarter compared to approximately 20.5 million for the 2023 quarter. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales was approximately 16.9 for the 2024 quarter compared to approximately 15.7 for the 2023 quarter. 
 
 Our operating results are significantly impacted by the market price of hot-rolled steel coil ("HRC"). HRC price declined approximately 25 during the 2023 quarter with this decline being part of a downward price cycle which commenced in April 2023. From April 2023 and to the end of the 2023 quarter, HRC price declined approximately 45 . As a result, the Company experienced compressed margins during the 2023 quarter. Entering the 2024 quarter, HRC prices were on a predominately declining trend dropping approximately 40 from January 2024 through the middle of the 2024 quarter. As a result, the Company experienced compressed physical margins during the 2024 quarter. The Company utilizes HRC futures to partially manage exposure to commodity price risk. The Company recognized hedging related gains of approximately 0.2 million and 4.4 million in the 2024 and 2023 quarters, respectively. 
 
 Flat-roll Segment 
 
 Flat-roll product segment sales for the 2024 quarter totaled approximately 97.4 million compared to approximately 120.5 million for the 2023 quarter. For a more complete understanding of the average selling prices of goods sold, it is helpful to exclude any sales generated from processing or storage of customer owned material. Sales generated from processing or storage of customer owned material totaled approximately 1.1 million for the 2024 quarter compared to approximately 1.3 million for the 2023 quarter. Sales generated from flat-roll segment inventory totaled approximately 96.2 million for the 2024 quarter compared to approximately 119.2 million for the 2023 quarter. The average per ton selling price related to these shipments decreased from approximately 983 per ton in the 2023 quarter to approximately 858 per ton in the 2024 quarter. Sales volume for the 2024 quarter consisted of approximately 112,000 tons from inventory and another 18,000 tons of toll processing customer owned material compared to the 2023 quarter volume consisting of approximately 121,000 tons from inventory and 26,000 tons of toll processing. The decline in sales volume for the 2024 quarter was related to a combination of weaker demand among some customers and hesitancy among others given the political uncertainty at the time. Flat-roll segment operations recorded operating profits of approximately 2.7 million and 3.1 million for the 2024 quarter and 2023 quarter, respectively. 
 
 The Company s flat-roll segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 
 Tubular Segment 
 
 Tubular product segment sales for the 2024 quarter totaled approximately 9.4 million compared to approximately 10.2 million for the 2023 quarter. Sales decreased due primarily to a decrease in the average selling price per ton from approximately 1,217 per ton for the 2023 quarter to approximately 1,030 per ton for the 2024 quarter. Sales volume was comparable between the periods with approximately 9,000 tons sold in the 2024 quarter compared to approximately 8,500 tons sold in the 2023 quarter. The tubular segment recorded an operating loss of approximately 0.6 million for t he 2024 quarter compared to a break even operating profit for the 2023 quarter. 
 
 The tubular segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 

General, Selling and Administrative Costs 

During the 2024 quarter, selling, general and administrative costs decreased approximately 0.8 million compared to the 2023 quarter. This decrease is primarily related to lower incentive compensation expense due to the lower earnings in the 2024 quarter.

Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes decreased from a provision for the 2023 quarter of approximately 1.1 million to a benefit for the 2024 quarter of approximately 0.2 million. This decrease was primarily related to lower earnings before taxes for the 2024 quarter. The income tax provision or benefit as a percentage of earnings or loss before tax was approximately 25.2 and 24.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively . For both periods, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due primarily to the inclusion of state tax expenses in the provision. 

Non-GAAP Information 
 
 The non-GAAP measure adjusted gross profit is used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Adjusted gross profit is calculated as sales minus cost of materials sold. Cost of materials sold is a discrete line on our statements of operations and represents the cost associated with direct materials. To provide financial statement users with a better understanding of the Company's expenses, cost of sales is disaggregated on our statements of operations into the line items cost of materials sold, processing and warehousing expense, delivery expense and depreciation and amortization. The Company believes adjusted gross profit is a meaningful measure because our cost structure and operating results are significantly impacted by the fluctuating costs associated with direct materials. 
 
 The following table reconciles the GAAP measure for gross profit to the non-GAAP measure adjusted gross profit (in thousands):

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The Company s current ratio amounted to 4.1 a t September 30, 2024 and 3.1 at March 31, 2024 . Working capital was approximately 111.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 116.0 million at March 31, 2024 . 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company maintained assets and liabilities at levels it believed were commensurate with operations. Changes in balance sheet amounts occurred in the ordinary course of business. Cash and restricted cash decreased due primarily to cash used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and the reduction of debt. The Company ex pects to continue to monitor, evaluate and manage balance sheet components depending on changes in market conditions and the Company s operations. 
 
 The Company has a 150 million asset-based lending facility ("ABL Facility") which matures on May 19, 2026 and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Company can elect borrowings on a floating rate basis or a term basis. Floating rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the prime rate minus 1 per annum. Term rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the SOFR rate applicable to the selected term plus 1.8 per annum. Availability of funds under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation determined as the sum of (a) 90 of eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidating value percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by eligible inventory. The ABL Facility contains a springing financial covenant whereby the financial covenant is only tested when availability falls below the greater of 15 of the revolving commitment or 22.5 million. The financial covenant restricts the Company from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio to be, as of the end of any calendar month, less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the trailing twelve month period then ending. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of (a) EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, minus unfinanced capital expenditures to (b) cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments on indebtedness plus taxes paid in cash plus restricted payments paid in cash plus capital lease obligation payments plus cash contributions to any employee pension benefit plans. The ABL Facility contains other representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary. If certain conditions precedent are satisfied, the ABL facility may be increased by up to an aggregate of 25 million, in minimum increments of 5 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a balance of approximately 35.9 million under the ABL Facility with an applicable interest rate of 7.0 . At September 30, 2024, the Company's applicable borrowing base calculation supported access to approximately 104.7 million of the ABL Facility. As of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, the Company had borrowings of approximately 33.1 million outstanding under the ABL Facility and the Company's most recent borrowing base calculation provided access to approximately 98.8 million of the ABL Facility. 
 
 The Company believes that its current cash position along with cash flows from operations and borrowing capability due to its financial position are adequate to fund its expected cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
 
 HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
 
 The Company utilizes hot-rolled coil futures to manage price risk on unsold inventory and longer-term fixed price sales agreements. The Company has elected hedge accounting for some of its hedging activities previously but most recently the Company has classified its hedging activities as economic hedges of risk with mark-to-market ("MTM") accounting treatment. Hedging decisions are intended to protect the value of the Company's inventory and produce more consistent financial results over price cycles. The Company recognized gains of approximately 0.2 million and 5.6 million in the three month and six month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to hedging activities with all of this being classified as economic hedges of risk. With MTM accounting treatment it is possible that hedging related gains or losses might be recognized in a different fiscal quarter or fiscal year than the corresponding improvement or contraction in our physical margins. See Note H for additional information related to the Company's hedging activities. 
 
 OUTLOOK 
 
 The Company expects sales volume for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to be slightly lower than the second quarter volume due primarily to the seasonal impact of holidays. HRC price remained stable to start the third quarter resulting in minimal change to the Company s sales prices and margins. As a result, the Company may experience a generally challenging margin environment in the third quarter. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from any estimates. The Company did not identify any significant estimates or judgements related to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented in this Form 10-Q filing.

12. 

MISCELLANEOUS 

12.1 Plan Not an Employment Contract . The adoption and maintenance of the Plan is not a contract between the Company and its employees that gives any employee the right to be retained in its employment. Likewise, it is not intended to interfere with the rights of the Company to terminate an employee s employment at any time with or without notice and with or without cause or to interfere with an employee's right to terminate his or her employment at any time. 

12.2 Alienation Prohibited . No benefits hereunder shall be subject to anticipation or assignment by a Participant, to attachment by, interference with, or control of any creditor of a Participant, or to being taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or liability of a Participant prior to its actual receipt by the Participant. Any attempted conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage, pledge, or encumbrance of the benefits hereunder prior to payment thereof shall be void. 

12.3 Severability . Each provision of the Plan may be severed. If any provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. 

12.4 Binding Effect . The Plan shall be binding upon any successor of the Company. Further, the Company and the Board shall not authorize a Change in Control that is a Merger or a sale transaction unless the acquirer or the Company s successor agrees to take such actions as are necessary to cause all Participants to be paid or provided all benefits due under the terms of the Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. 

12.5 No Mitigation . The Company agrees that if the Participant s employment with the Company terminates during the term of the Plan, the Participant is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to the Participant by the Company pursuant to the Plan. Further, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in the Plan shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Participant as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Participant to the Company, or otherwise.

Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, the payments and benefits provided for in the Plan are in addition to and not in lieu of amounts and benefits that are earned by a Participant prior to his Involuntary Termination. The Company shall pay a Participant any compensation earned prior to the date the Participant incurs an Involuntary Termination but not previously paid the Participant. Further the Participant shall be entitled to any other amounts or benefits due the Participant in accordance with any contract, plan, program or policy of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Amounts that the Participant is entitled to receive under any plan, program, contract or policy of the Company or any of its Affiliates at or subsequent to the Participant s Involuntary Termination shall be payable or otherwise provided in accordance with such plan, program, contract or policy, except as expressly modified herein. 

12.7 Notices to Participants . For the purpose of the Plan, notices provided for in the Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed, in the case of a notice to the Participant, to the Participant s residential address shown in the records of the Company, or to such other address as the Participant may have furnished to the Company in writing, and in the case of a notice to the Company or any Affiliate, to the address of the Company s then current Corporate Headquarters. 

12.8 Governing Law . All provisions of the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, except to the extent preempted by federal law and except to the extent that the conflicts of laws provisions of the State of Texas would require the application of the relevant law of another jurisdiction, in which event the relevant law of the State of Texas will nonetheless apply, with venue for litigation being solely and exclusively in Houston, Texas. 

- 15 -

12.9 Compliance With Section 409A . It is intended that payments and benefits under the Plan comply with Section 409A, to the extent subject thereto, or with an exemption thereunder, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted accordingly. Any payments or benefits under the Plan that may be excluded from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service, as a short-term deferral or otherwise shall be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. For purposes of Section 409A, each installment payment provided under the Plan shall be treated as a separate payment. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, a Participant shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company Group for purposes of any payments under the Plan which are subject to Section 409A until the Participant has incurred a separation from service from the Company Group within the meaning of Section 409A. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the Participant is a specified employee (as that term is defined for purposes of Section 409A) as of the date of his or her separation from service then to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that are required to comply with, and are not otherwise exempt from, Section 409A and that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to the Plan during the six-month period immediately following the Participant s separation from service shall instead be paid or provided on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months following such Participant s separation from service (or, if earlier, the Participant s date of death) (such date of payment, the Specified Employee Payment Date ). The aggregate of any such payments that would otherwise have been paid before the Specified Employee Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum (without interest) on the Specified Employee Payment Date and thereafter, any remaining payments shall be paid without delay in accordance with their original schedule. To the extent required to avoid an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, amounts reimbursable to a Participant under the Plan shall be paid to the Participant on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred, the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in kind benefits provided to the Participant) during one calendar year may not affect amounts reimbursable or in kind benefits provided in any other calendar year, and any right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Plan shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. The Company Group makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in the Plan will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to any such payment, and in no event shall the Company Group be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by a Participant on account of any non-compliance with Section 409A.
