 Management evaluates securities for impairment from credit losses at least quarterly, and more frequently when economic and market conditions warrant such evaluations. Consideration is given to numerous factors including, but not limited to, the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions causing changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security or underlying loan guarantors; changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and the Company s intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost, which may extend to maturity. 
 
 The Company performs a process to determine whether the decline in the fair value of securities has resulted from credit losses or other factors. This process involves evaluating each security for impairment by monitoring credit performance, collateral type, collateral geography, bond credit support, loan-to-value ratios, credit scores, loss severity levels, pricing levels, downgrades by rating agencies, cash flow projections and other factors as indicators of potential credit issues. If this evaluation indicates the existence of credit losses, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis. If the present value of expected cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis, an ACL is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost.

 Non-designated Hedges 
 
 Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings through other income.

 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , requires the disclosure of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate. The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. ASC 820 excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. 
 
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial statements. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 
 Fair value estimates included herein are based on existing on- and off-balance-sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the fair value of assets and liabilities that are not required to be recorded or disclosed at fair value like premises and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates. 
 
 Methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The fair value of subordinated debt is estimated based on current market rates on similar debt in the market. The Company classifies this debt in Level 2 of the fair value table. There have been no other material changes from the fair value estimate methods and assumptions previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 The Company reported net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 9.4 million, or 1.18 diluted EPS, down 317,000 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Net income for the third quarter of 2023 totaled 9.8 million, or 1.22 diluted EPS. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income 26.8 million, or 3.34 diluted EPS, down 4.1 million from 30.9 million, or 3.82 diluted EPS, reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Key components of the Company s performance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include: 
 
 Assets increased 121.9 million, or 3.7 , from December 31, 2023 to 3.4 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Total loans were 2.7 billion at September 30, 2024, up 86.6 million, or 3.4 , from December 31, 2023. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company provisioned 140,000 and 1.5 million, respectively, to the allowance for loan losses, primarily due to loan growth and net charge-offs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company provisioned 351,000 and 1.7 million, respectively, to the allowance for loan losses. 
 The ALL totaled 32.3 million, or 1.21 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 compared to 31.5 million, or 1.22 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The ACL, which is comprised of the allowance for loan losses plus the allowance for unfunded lending commitments, totaled 34.7 million, or 1.30 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 compared to 34.1 million, or 1.32 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. 
 Nonperforming assets increased 8.0 million, or 76.7 , from 10.4 million, or 0.31 of total assets, at December 31, 2023 to 18.4 million, or 0.53 of total assets, at September 30, 2024. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to four loan relationships being downgraded to substandard during the 2024 period. 
 Total deposits amounted to 2.8 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 106.9 million, or 4.0 , from December 31, 2023. 
 The net interest margin was 3.71 and 3.67 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, down 4 bps and down 28 bps from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits was 2.78 for the third quarter of 2024, which was up 94 bps from the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits was 2.66 , up 134 bps from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 33 

Total interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was up 4.4 million, or 35.2 , compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the rising interest rate environment and the higher cost of deposits. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total interest expense was up 19.4 million, or 67.3 , from the comparable period in 2023. 
 Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was down 707,000, or 16.1 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in gain on sale of loans (down 492,000) and a decrease in bank card fees (down 290,000), which were partially offset with an increase in other income (up 55,000). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income was down 162,000, or 1.5 , from the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease bank card fees (down 466,000) and a decrease in gain on sale of loans (down 362,000), which were partially offset with an increase in other income (up 336,000) and the absence of net loss on sale of securities totaling 249,000 during the first quarter of 2023. 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was up 920,000, or 4.3 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits (up 566,000), data processing and communication (up 150,000), occupancy (up 322,000), and other expenses (up 267,000), which were partially offset with a decrease in marketing and advertising (down 256,000). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was up 2.7 million, or 4.3 , from the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to the absence of a recovery of a previous loss on a foreclosed asset that occurred in the first quarter of 2023 in the amount of 739,000, increases in data processing and communication expense (up 766,000), other noninterest expense (up 687,000), occupancy (up 582,000) and compensation and benefits (up 484,000), which were partially offset by the reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments (down 495,000).

 Loans 
 Total loans at September 30, 2024 were 2.7 billion, up 86.6 million, or 3.4 , from December 31, 2023. 
 The following table summarizes the composition of the Company s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL which equals the sum of the ALL and the ACL on unfunded lending commitments, is established through provisions for credit losses. Management recalculates the ACL at least quarterly to reassess the estimate of credit losses for the total portfolio at the relevant reporting date. Under ASC Topic 326, the ACL is measured on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. For each pool of loans, management also evaluates and applies qualitative adjustments to the calculated ACL based on several factors, including, but not limited to, changes in current and expected future economic conditions, changes in industry experience and industry loan concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of nonperforming assets, 
 34 

changes in lending policies and personnel and changes in the competitive and regulatory environment of the banking industry. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually evaluated and are excluded from the pooled loan analysis. 
 
 The ACL policy described above is supplemented by periodic reviews and validations performed by independent loan reviewers. The results of the reviews are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The establishment of the ACL is significantly affected by management judgment. There is likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our ACL. Such agencies may require management to make additional provisions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management. 
 
 We continue to monitor and modify our ACL as conditions warrant. No assurance can be given that our level of ACL will cover all of the losses on our loans or that future adjustments to the ACL will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used by management to determine the current level of the ACL. 

At September 30, 2024, the ALL totaled 32.3 million, or 1.21 of total loans, up 741,000 from 31.5 million, or 1.22 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company provisioned 1.5 million of the allowance loan losses primarily due to loan growth and net charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs totaled 801,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 One of management s key objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. In addition to maintaining credit standards for new loan originations, we proactively monitor loans and collection and workout processes of delinquent or problem loans. When a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment, we attempt to cure the deficiency by making personal contact with the borrower. Initial contacts are generally made within 10 days after the date payment is due. In most cases, deficiencies are promptly resolved. If the delinquency continues, late charges are assessed and additional efforts are made to collect the deficiency. All loans which are designated as special mention, classified or which are delinquent 90 days or more are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank monthly. For loans where the collection of principal or interest payments is doubtful, the accrual of interest income ceases. It is our policy, with certain limited exceptions, to discontinue accruing interest and reverse any interest accrued on any loan which is 90 days or more past due. On occasion, this action may be taken earlier if the financial condition of the borrower raises significant concern with regard to their ability to service the debt in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Interest income is not accrued on these loans until the borrower s financial condition and payment record demonstrate an ability to service the debt. 
 
 Under our allowance policy, credit losses are measured on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually evaluated for credit losses and are excluded from the pooled loan analysis. At least quarterly, management evaluates the loan portfolio to determine which loans should be individually evaluated for credit losses. Management's evaluation involves an analysis of larger (i.e., loans with balances of 500,000 or greater) commercial real estate loans, multi-family residential loans, construction and land loans and commercial and industrial loans. Third party property valuations are obtained at the time of origination for real estate secured loans. When a determination is made that a loan has deteriorated to the point of becoming a problem loan, updated valuations may be ordered to determine if a short-fall exists, which may lead to a recommendation for partial charge off or appropriate allowance allocation. Property valuations are ordered through, and are reviewed by, an appraisal officer at the Bank. The Company typically orders an as is valuation for collateral property if a loan is in a criticized loan classification. Loans individually evaluated for credit losses are reported to the Board of Directors monthly. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans identified as credit deteriorated loans and individually evaluated for expected losses were 4.4 million and 4.2 million, respectively. The following tables provide a summary of loans individually evaluated for credit losses as of the dates indicated.

 Federal regulations and our policies require that we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets. We have incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans classified as substandard totaled 34.7 million and 28.2 million, respectively. There were no assets classified as doubtful at either date. For additional information, refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 6.5 million, or 23.1 , increase in substandard loans at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to four credit relationships being downgraded, partially offset by loan payoffs and improvements in other classified loans. 
 
 The following tables provide a summary of loans classified as special mention and substandard as of the dates indicated.

The primary reason for the increase was one loan relationship with an aggregate outstanding balance of 4.7 million at September 30, 2024 that became nonperforming during the first quarter of 2024. This relationship is secured by 17 residential units in eight investment properties in New Orleans with an aggregate loan-to-value ratio of approximately 65 . We have commenced foreclosure proceedings on this relationship and do not expect any loss. There were also additional smaller loan balances downgraded to nonperforming during the period, but we do not anticipate any losses associated with these loans. 
 
 A bank s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by Federal bank regulators which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. The Federal banking agencies have adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses. The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines. Generally, the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that management analyze all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and that management establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement. Management maintains, based on current and forecasted information, an ACL that reflects a current estimate of expected credit losses for the estimated life of the loan portfolio at reporting periods subsequent to the adoption date. For all reporting periods, actual losses are uncertain and dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of ACL may become necessary.

 Foreclosed assets and ORE includes real property and other assets that have been acquired as a result of foreclosure, and real property no longer used in the Bank's business. Foreclosed assets and ORE are classified as such until sold or disposed. Foreclosed assets are recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs based on third party property valuations which are obtained at the time the asset is repossessed and periodically until the property is liquidated. ORE is recorded at the lower of its net book value or fair value at the date of transfer to ORE. Foreclosed assets and ORE holding costs are charged to expense. Gains and losses on the sale of foreclosed assets and ORE are charged to operations, as incurred. Costs associated with acquiring and improving a foreclosed property or ORE are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed fair value less estimated selling costs. 
 
 Investment Securities 
 
 The Company s investment securities portfolio totaled 421.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 13.2 million, or 3.0 , from December 31, 2023. During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the Company had no gains or losses related to the sale of available-for-sale investment securities.

 Subordinated Debt 
 
 On June 30, 2022, the Company issued 55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2032. The Notes were issued at a price equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount. The Notes have a stated maturity date of June 30, 2032 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.75 per year from and including the issue date to but excluding June 30, 2027. From June 30, 2027, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the then current three-month term secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus 282 basis points. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company, in whole or in part, on or after June 30, 2027. The Notes are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. 
 
 The carrying value of subordinated debt was 54.4 million and 54.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The subordinated debt was recorded net of issuance costs and amortized using the straight-line method over five years. 
 
 Other Borrowings 
 
 On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve Board created the BTFP, which offers loans to banks with a term up to one year with no prepayment penalty. The loans are secured by pledging qualifying securities and are valued at par for collateral. In 2024, the Bank participated in the BTFP and had an outstanding debt of 135.0 million at September 30, 2024. The average balance of other borrowings, which included the BTFP loan was 140.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 135.0 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances 
 
 The average balance of total FHLB advances was 56.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 216.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of total FHLB advances was 58.3 million, down 195.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We reduced our FHLB advances in 2024 primarily due to our increased utilization of BTFP loans as an alternative source of funds. 
 39 

The Company had no short-term FHLB advances as of September 30, 2024 compared to 150.0 million as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 38.4 million and 42.7 million in long-term FHLB advances, respectively, and 1.1 billion and 1.0 billion in additional FHLB advances available, respectively. 
 
 Shareholders Equity 
 
 Total shareholders equity increased 26.0 million, or 7.1 , from 367.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 393.5 million at September 30, 2024. Shareholders' equity increased primarily due to net income of 26.8 million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss on available for sale investment securities, which were partially offset by cash dividends and share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank had regulatory capital amounts that were well in excess of regulatory requirements. The following table presents actual and required capital ratios for the Company and the Bank under the Basel III Capital Rules. The minimum required capital amounts presented include the minimum required capital levels as of September 30, 2024 based on the required capital levels as of January 1, 2019 when the Basel III Capital Rules were fully phased-in. Capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III Capital Rules.

LIQUIDITY AND ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 
 
 Liquidity Management 
 Liquidity management encompasses our ability to ensure that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while also ensuring adequate cash flow exists to meet the Company s needs, including operating, strategic and capital. The Company develops its liquidity management strategies as part of its overall asset/liability management process. Our primary sources of funds are from deposits, amortization of loans, loan prepayments and the maturity of loans, investment securities and other investments, and other funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and investment securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company also maintains excess funds in short-term, interest-bearing assets that provide additional liquidity. 
 
 The Company uses its liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments, to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals, to invest in other interest-earning assets and to meet operating expenses. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit maturing within the next 12 months totaled 680.8 million. Based upon historical experience, the Company anticipates that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be redeposited with us. 
 
 In addition to cash flow from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of securities available for sale, the Company has significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs. In recent years, the Company has utilized borrowings as a cost efficient addition to deposits as a source of funds. Borrowings consist of advances from the FHLB of Dallas, of which the Company is a member. Under terms of the collateral agreement with the FHLB, the Company pledges 
 40 

residential mortgage loans and investment securities as well as the Company s stock in the FHLB as collateral for such advances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of outstanding FHLB advances was 58.3 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 38.4 million in total outstanding FHLB advances. 
 
 The following table summarizes the Company's primary and secondary sources of liquidity which were available at September 30, 2024. 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 135,877 Unencumbered investment securities, amortized cost 59,838 FHLB advance availability 1,147,306 Amounts available from unsecured lines of credit 55,000 Federal Reserve discount window availability 500 Total primary and secondary sources of available liquidity 1,398,521 
 
 Asset/Liability Management 
 The objective of asset/liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of the Company s financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk. Interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows. The Company measures its interest rate sensitivity over the near term primarily by running net interest income simulations. Our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of a model which generates estimates of the change in its net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios. Based on the Company s interest rate risk model, the table below sets forth the results of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Shift in Interest Rates (in bps) Change in Projected Net Interest Income +200 1.7 +100 1.0 -100 (1.5) -200 (3.4) 
 
 The actual impact of changes in interest rates will depend on many factors. These factors include the Company s ability to achieve expected growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the actual timing of asset and liability repricing, the magnitude of interest rate changes and corresponding movement in interest rate spreads and the level of success of asset/liability management strategies. 
 
 The Company periodically has entered into interest rate swap agreements as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. During 2024 and 2023, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cost associated with existing variable rate liabilities. Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the effects of the derivative financial instruments on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 To meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company issues financial instruments which represent conditional obligations that are not recognized, wholly or in part, in the statements of financial condition. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such instruments expose the Company to varying degrees of credit and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans. The same credit policies are used in these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments totaled 2.5 million.

The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of credit, lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans as of the periods indicated. 
 
 Contract Amount (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Standby letters of credit 7,133 7,289 Available portion of lines of credit 505,051 368,398 Undisbursed portion of loans in process 73,877 221,997 Commitments to originate loans 150,273 127,076 
 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to be drawn upon, the total commitment amounts generally represent future cash requirements. 
 
 Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. 
 
 The Company is subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company provisioned 140,000 and 1.5 million, respectively, to the allowance for loan losses primarily due to loan growth and net charge-offs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company provisioned 351,000 and 1.7 million, respectively, to the allowance for loan losses primarily due to loan growth. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company s net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company s tax-equivalent net interest spread was 2.80 and 2.99 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2.80 and 3.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net interest income totaled 30.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 873,000, or 3.0 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled 88.7 million, down 2.7 million, or 3.0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company s tax-equivalent net interest margin, which is net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets, was 3.71 and 3.75 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the same periods, the average loan yield was 6.43 and 5.95 , respectively. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.67 and 3.95 , respectively. For the same periods, the average loan yield was 6.30 and 5.82 , respectively. 
 
 42 

Acquired loan discount accretion included in interest income totaled 452,000 and 634,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, acquired loan discount accretion included in interest income totaled 1.5 million and 1.9 million, respectively. 
 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income of the Company from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rate; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin. Information is based on average monthly balances during the indicated periods. Taxable equivalent yields are calculated using a marginal tax rate of 21 .

 Noninterest Income 
 
 Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 3.7 million, down 707,000, or 16.1 , from 4.4 million earned for the same period in 2023. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 11.0 million, down 162,000, or 1.5 , from 11.2 million earned for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Gains on the sale of loans for the third quarter of 2024 were down 492,000, or 71.6 , from the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gains on the sale of loans were down 362,000, or 47.0 , from the comparable period in 2023 due to a decrease in mortgage loan sales. 
 
 There were no gains or losses related to the sale of investment securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded a net loss of 249,000 related to the sale of investment securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other income for the third quarter of 2024 was up 55,000, or 20.6 , from the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income was up 336,000, or 46.9 , from the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in derivative fee income during 2024. 
 
 Income from bank card fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was down 290,000, or 15.2 and down 466,000, or 8.6 , respectively from the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to variations in transaction volumes by our cardholders. 
 
 Noninterest Expense 
 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 22.3 million, up 920,000, or 4.3 , from the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense increased over the comparable quarters primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits (up 566,000, primarily due to increases in salaries), occupancy expenses (up 322,000), and other noninterest expense (up 267,000), which were partially offset by marketing and advertising (down 256,000). 
 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 64.9 million, up 2.7 million, or 4.3 , from the same period in 2023. The increase in noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related primarily to the absence of a recovery of a previous loss on a foreclosed asset in the first quarter of 2023 in the amount of 739,000, increases in data processing and communication expense (up 766,000, primarily due to increases in cost of maintenance contracts), other noninterest expense (up 687,000), occupancy expense (up 582,000), and compensation and benefits (up 484,000), which were partially offset by the reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments (a difference of 495,000). 
 45 

Income Taxes 
 
 Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.2 million and 6.4 million, respectively, compared to 2.5 million and 7.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Income tax expense decreased over the prior comparable quarter primarily due to decreased taxable earnings. The Company's effective tax rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 19.2 and 20.2 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's effective tax rates were 19.4 and 20.2 , respectively. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 SEC guidance requires disclosure of critical accounting estimates. The SEC defines critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. 
 
 We follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, management believes the policy noted below meets the SEC s definition of a critical accounting policy. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Management considers the policies related to the allowance for credit losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation. The total allowance for credit losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 326, Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to current earnings. The amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of the credit losses expected to be recognized over the life of the loans in our portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. For purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the loan portfolio is segregated by product types in order to recognize differing risk profiles among categories. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made to incorporate our reasonable and supportable forecast of future losses at the portfolio segment level, as well as any necessary qualitative adjustments, including, but not limited to, changes in current and expected future economic conditions, changes in industry experience and industry loan concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of nonperforming assets, changes in lending policies and personnel and changes in the competitive and regulatory environment of the banking industry. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually evaluated and are excluded from the pooled loan analysis. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk . Additional information at September 30, 2024 is included herein under Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and are operating in an effective manner. 
 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
