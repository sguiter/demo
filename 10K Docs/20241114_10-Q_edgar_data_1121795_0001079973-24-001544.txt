The Company has an accumulated deficit of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively
and a stockholders deficit of and as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company used and in
cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Management believes these conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date these financial statements
were issued. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon profitable future operations, positive cash flows, and additional
financing. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recovery and classification of recorded asset amounts
and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management intends to raise money through investors
as needed to support its working capital needs. Currently the Company intends to raise capital from its existing shareholders and from
the possible sale of a minority interest in its subsidiaries. Management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful
in completing these undertakings and accomplishing any of its plans.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 

Overview 

We are a holding company for various technology and
related activities. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report ), our principal business strategy
is seeking to exploit a patent and obtain and exploit future patents for the Smart Shin Guard, and developing a business through a subsidiary
formed in April 2023 which is in the early stages of exploring potential business opportunities. 

The Smart Shin Guard is a wearable protective device
designed to be used while playing soccer and other sports combined with data collection and analysis technology that monitors players 
individual and collective physical and performance-based metrics and transmits this information to a separate module in real-time. 

We have not generated revenue on a consistent basis
or in amounts which are necessary to offset operating losses, and need substantial additional financing to continue the development and
commercialization of our business plan and related products and service. 

Recent Developments 

We are currently seeking vendors to further develop
the Smart Shin Guard with the goal of beginning marketing of the product in 2025. To do so, we need to determine and complete the specifications
for our product and begin production of a completed product in collaboration with our vendor, which may entail, among other things, obtaining
sufficient additional capital. We are also in search of other strategic alliances and potential business opportunities to develop and
enhance our business plan and intended product offerings. 

Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. 

Fiscal Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared
to the Fiscal Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 

We had 45,732 in revenue in the three months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to 23,841 revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and we sustained net losses of 12,717 and
 56,095, respectively, in those periods. The revenue during the 2024 period related to the Company s provision of consulting services
through InSSiDe World Inc. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, operating expenses were 58,449 and 78,841, respectively, which consisted of general and administrative expenses, including professional
fees for legal and financial services, and patent development costs in the 2024 period. 

We do not expect to generate material revenue unless
and until we are able to implement our business plan and begin marketing and selling our products and services in sufficient quantities,
which has been delayed due to a combination of our limited capital resources and external forces resulting in delays in the development
of our business, which has and until completed will continue to adversely affect our marketing capabilities. In addition, our focus on
multiple businesses beginning in recent periods may further delay these efforts and our operating results given our limited resources
and personnel. 

In order to become profitable, we will need to complete
the development of a functional product and thereafter establish a sufficient market for our product, including internationally, to offset
our development, manufacturing and advertising costs, and our ability to do so will be subject to a number of factors, many of which will
be beyond our control. We will also need to access sufficient capital, form strategic alliances and develop an adequate market with respect
to any future business opportunities we may pursue. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Net Cash used by Operating Activities : 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company used net cash of 45,173 in operating activities as compared to 43,302 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, remaining
relatively stable between periods. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities : 

Cash flows provided by financing activities for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 were 29,039 compared to 11,243 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase
in the 2024 period in advances from related parties. 

11 

Liquidity 

We have 2,168 in available cash as of September 30,
2024 and for the past two years we have been relying on loans from our current investors and related parties and proceeds from sales of
our common stock to fund our operations. As reflected in the financial statements contained in this Report, management has expressed substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date the financial statements were issued, unless
we can raise the required capital or generate material revenue to fund our operations. 

The Company expects to continue to use a portion of
the authorized but unissued shares to raise capital and/or to convert previous loans made to the Company. 

The Company requires additional capital to continue
its development efforts with respect to its products and services, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, in the quantities
and within the timeframes needed, or at all. 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

This Report contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the development of the Smart Shin
Guard and plans to begin commercializing the product, our exploration of potential new business opportunities, the implementation of our
business plan and expected timelines for meeting objectives, future sources of revenue, our use of common stock in capital raising efforts
and to satisfy previous advances to us, and our liquidity. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates, 
 intends, plans, seeks, believes, estimates, expects 
and similar references to future periods. 

Forward-looking statements are based on our current
expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate
to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying on any
of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance.
The results anticipated by any or all of these forward-looking statements might not occur. Important factors, uncertainties and risks
that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include the risks arising from the potential
adverse effects of inflation, increased interest rates in response, geopolitical conflicts such as those occurring in Israel and Ukraine
and negative operational impacts or an economic downturn or recession which may result, which may result in delays or obstacles in or
prevent our ability to raise capital, supply chain disruptions, shortages and delays which may adversely affect our ability to develop,
manufacture and sell our products and services within the intended timeframes or at all, declines in consumer spending particularly to
non-essential products and services such as those that we intend to offer, risks and uncertainties surrounding any new business opportunities
we pursue, and the risks summarized our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 in the section titled Item
1A. Risk Factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as the
result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officers, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were not effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms because of a material weakness in the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to identify and maintain segregation of duties
to support the identification, authorization, approval, accounting for, and the disclosure of related-party transactions and non-routine
transactions. One individual, the Chief Executive Officer, initiates related-party transactions and non-routine transactions and also
reviews, evaluates and approves these same transactions. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Report
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

12 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time-to-time, we may
be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. As of the date of this Report,
we are not aware of any other pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results
of our operations and there are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial
shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

All unregistered sales of equity securities through
the period covered by this Report have previously been disclosed. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) or any contract,
instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions
of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 arrangement as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K.
