FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our future results of operations and financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, approximately, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, outlook, plan, potential, predict, seek, should, will and would or the negative version of these words or other comparable or similar words. These statements identify prospective information. Important factors could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those indicated in these statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to us. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. 
 In addition to factors previously disclosed in Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC s BOH reports filed with securities regulators in the United States and those identified elsewhere in this quarterly report, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements and information or historical performance: the ability of BOH to retain and hire key service providers; the continued availability of capital and financing; the business, economic and political conditions in the markets in which BOH operates; changes in BOH s anticipated revenue and income, which are inherently volatile; changes in the value of BOH s investments; the pace of Oaktree s raising of new funds; changes in assets under management; the timing and receipt of, and impact of taxes on, carried interest; distributions from and liquidation of Oaktree s existing funds; the amount and timing of distributions on BOH s preferred units; changes in BOH s operating or other expenses; the degree to which BOH encounters competition; and general political, economic and market conditions. 
 Any forward-looking statements and information speak only as of the date of this quarterly report or as of the date they were made, and except as required by law, BOH does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements and information. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, also see the information under the captions Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in BOH s most recent report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC (our annual report ), and in this quarterly report, and in each case any material updates to these factors contained in any of BOH s future filings. 
 As for the forward-looking statements and information that relate to future financial results and other projections, actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected and such differences could be material. Given these uncertainties, you should not place any reliance on these forward-looking statements and information.

 economic interest in Oaktree Capital I, L.P. Oaktree Capital I , which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree s investments in its funds. 
 The Company is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on April 13, 2007 under the name of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC. The Company s issued and outstanding member interests are divided into certain classes and series of units. The Company s outstanding units are held by (i) an affiliate of Brookfield Corporation (formerly known as Brookfield Asset Management, Inc.) Brookfield as the sole holder of the Company s Class A common units, (ii) preferred unitholders as the holders of Series A and Series B preferred units listed on the NYSE, which represent only the right to receive certain distributions from the Company and such other rights as are specified in the relevant preferred unit designations, and (iii) Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. OCGH as the sole holder of the Company s Class B common units, which units do not represent an economic interest in the Company. OCGH is owned by Oaktree s senior executives, current and former Oaktree employees, and their respective transferees (collectively, the OCGH unitholders ). Subject to the operating agreement of the Company, to the extent the approval of any matter requires the vote of the Company s unitholders, the Class A units are entitled to vote per unit and the Class B units are entitled to votes per unit, voting together as a single class. 
 
 The Company s ownership and operational structure through were the result of (i) certain mergers with affiliates of Brookfield completed on September 30, 2019 (the Mergers and the subsequent restructuring completed on October 1, 2019 in connection with the Mergers (the 2019 Restructuring ), (ii) the restructuring completed on November 30, 2022 in connection with an internal Oaktree reorganization to facilitate the separation of Brookfield s capital business and asset management business (the 2022 Restructuring and (iii) the restructuring completed on July 1, 2024 in connection with an internal Oaktree reorganization which resulted in the change of the general partner of Oaktree Capital I, L.P. from Brookfield OCM Holdings II, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, to Oaktree Capital I GP, LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Holdings, LLC OCH (the 2024 Restructuring ). See Part I, Item I included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020 for more information regarding the Mergers and the 2019 Restructuring. See Item 1.01 of the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 6, 2022 for more information about the 2022 Restructuring. See Item 8.01 of the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 1, 2024 for more information about the 2024 Restructuring. 
 
 Following the above restructurings, the Company s holdings and operations primarily represent (i) limited partner investments in certain of Oaktree s flagship opportunistic funds, (ii) an approximately economic interest in Oaktree Capital I, which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree s investments in its funds, and (iii) an indirect ownership in Brookfield Real Estate Income Trust Inc. Brookfield REIT ). 
 
 Oaktree is a leader among global investment managers specializing in alternative investments. 
 Oaktree emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in credit, private 
 equity, real assets and listed equities. Funds managed by Oaktree (the Oaktree funds include commingled funds, 
 separate accounts, collateralized loan obligation vehicles CLOs and business development companies BDCs ). 
 
 Following the 2022 Restructuring and prior to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company s operations were conducted through an indirect economic interest in Oaktree Capital I, and the Company s revenue included the incentive income generated by certain funds that OCM manages for which the Company, via Oaktree Capital I,

 interest in Oaktree Capital I under the equity method of accounting. The Company s revenue is primarily the investment income earned from (i) limited partner investments in certain of Oaktree s flagship opportunistic funds, (ii) an equity method investment in Oaktree Capital I, and (iii) an indirect ownership in Brookfield REIT. 
 
 Payments to the preferred unitholders must be satisfied prior to declaration of any distributions to Class A or Class B unitholders, subject to the terms of the Series A and Series B preferred units and certain limitations and exceptions set forth therein. 
 
 OCM, an affiliate of the Company, has since the 2019 Restructuring provided certain administrative and other services relating to the operations of the Company s business. These services are provided pursuant to a Services Agreement between the Company and OCM (as amended from time to time, the Services Agreement ).

 to . While limited partners in consolidated closed-end funds generally have not been granted redemption rights, these limited partners do have withdrawal or redemption rights in certain limited circumstances that are beyond the control of the Company, such as instances in which retaining the limited partnership interest could cause the limited partner to violate a law, regulation or rule. For Oaktree sponsored SPACs, the class A ordinary shareholders have redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control. These shares are presented as non-controlling redeemable interests on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 The allocation of net income or loss to non-controlling redeemable interests in consolidated funds and Oaktree sponsored SPACs is based on the relative ownership interests of the unaffiliated limited partners after the consideration of contractual arrangements that govern allocations of income or loss. At the consolidated level, potential incentives are allocated to non-controlling redeemable interests in consolidated funds until such incentives become allocable to the Company under the substantive contractual terms of the limited partnership agreements of the funds. 
 As a result of the 2024 Restructuring, Oaktree Capital I was deconsolidated as of July 1, 2024. As such, the funds consolidated by Oaktree Capital I are no longer consolidated by the Company.

 of each closed-end fund s profits, subject to the return of contributed capital and a preferred return of typically per annum, and up to of certain evergreen fund s annual profits, subject to high-water marks or hurdle rates. Incentive income is recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Revenue recognition is typically met (a) for closed-end funds, only after all contributed capital and the preferred return on that capital have been distributed to the fund s investors, and (b) for certain evergreen funds, at the conclusion of each annual measurement period. Potential incentive income is highly susceptible to market volatility, the judgment and actions of third parties, and other factors outside of the Company s control. The Company s experience has demonstrated little predictive value in the amount of potential incentive income ultimately earned due to the highly uncertain nature of returns inherent in the markets and contingencies associated with many realization events. As a result, the amount of incentive income recognized in any given period is generally determined after giving consideration to a number of factors, including whether the fund is in its investment or liquidation period, and the nature and level of risk associated with changes in fair value of the remaining assets in the fund. In general, it would be unlikely that any amount of potential incentive income would be recognized until (a) the uncertainty is resolved or (b) the fund is near final liquidation, assets are under contract for sale or are at low risk of significant fluctuation in fair value, and the assets are significantly in excess of the threshold at which incentive income would be earned. 
 Incentives received by Oaktree Capital I before the revenue recognition criteria have been met are deferred and recorded as a deferred incentive income liability within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. Oaktree Capital I may have received tax distributions related to taxable income allocated by funds, which are treated as an advance of incentive income and subject to the same recognition criteria. Tax distributions are contractually not subject to clawback. 
 Oaktree Capital I may have earned incentive income upon deconsolidation of a SPAC arising from the completion of a merger with an identified target. Upon deconsolidation, Oaktree Capital I derecognizes the net assets of the entity and records any gain or loss related to the remeasurement of its investments to fair value as incentive income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent fair value changes in Oaktree Capital I s investments held in the entity were recorded in investment income in its condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company no longer earns incentive income as a result of the 
 deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I. Rather the economics resulting from Oaktree Capital I s right to earn incentive 
 income are reflected in the Company s results through investment income earned from its equity method investment in Oaktree Capital I. 
 
 Investment Income 
 
 The Company records investment income (loss) from its equity method investments which 
 represents the Company s pro-rata share of income or loss from these investments, or the change in fair value of 
 the investment, as applicable, and consists of both unrealized and realized gains and losses. Investment income 
 (loss) is realized when the Company sells all or a portion of its investments or when the Company receives or is due

), in each case, under certain circumstances set forth in the applicable governing documents. These provisions are generally only applicable to incentive income compensation that has not yet been recognized as an expense by the Company or paid to the participant. 
 Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company no longer earns incentive income as a result of the 
 deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I, and therefore will no longer record incentive compensation expense. Compensation and benefits following the 2024 Restructuring primarily reflects compensation to the Company s board of directors.

 Effects of 2024 Restructuring 
 As a result of the 2024 Restructuring and the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I, certain accounts related to Oaktree Capital I are no longer included in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The effects of the 2024 Restructuring are summarized as follows: 
 The Company s economic interest in Oaktree Capital I is accounted for as an equity method investment, and the Company records its pro-rata share of Oaktree Capital I s net income as investment income. 
 The Company s incentive income consisted primarily of fees earned from funds managed by Oaktree Capital I. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company no longer earns incentive income. The Company s proportionate share of incentive income earned by Oaktree Capital I is included as a component of investment income. 
 Incentive compensation expense primarily reflected compensation directly related to incentive income. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company no longer recognizes incentive compensation expense, as it no longer earns the corresponding incentive income. 
 Certain funds and CLOs that were previously consolidated by Oaktree Capital I are no longer consolidated by the Company.

 Contract Balances 
 Prior to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company received incentive income in accordance with its contracts 
 with customers. Incentive income is received generally after all contributed capital and the preferred return on that capital have been distributed to the fund s investors. Contract assets relate to the Company s conditional right to receive payment for its performance completed under the contract. Receivables are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional (i.e., only requires the passage of time). Contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenues) relate to payments received in advance of performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenues when the Company provides investment management services. Subsequent to the 2024 
 Restructuring, the Company no longer recognizes contract assets, as it no longer earns the corresponding incentive 
 income due to the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I.

 As of September 30, 2024, the assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs amounted to billion and billion, respectively. The assets of these consolidated VIEs primarily consisted of investments in debt and equity securities, while their liabilities primarily represented debt obligations issued by consolidated funds. The assets of these VIEs may be used only to settle obligations of the same VIE. In addition, there is no recourse to the Company for the VIEs liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s investments in consolidated VIEs had a carrying value of billion, which represented its maximum risk of loss as of that date. 
 Unconsolidated VIEs 
 The Company held variable interests in certain VIEs in the form of direct equity interests that are not consolidated because it is not the primary beneficiary, inasmuch as Oaktree s fee arrangements are considered at-market and it does not hold interests in those entities that are considered more than insignificant.

 Equity-method Investments 
 The Company s equity-method investments include its investments in funds and companies that are not consolidated, but for which the Company is deemed to have significant influence. The Company s share of income or loss generated by these investments is recorded within investment income in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company s equity-method investments in Oaktree funds principally reflect the Company s general partner interests in those funds, which typically do not exceed in each fund. The Oaktree funds are investment companies that follow a specialized basis of accounting established by GAAP. In connection with the 2024 Restructuring, the Company determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of Oaktree Capital I and deconsolidated the entity, which is accounted for as an equity method investment beginning with the third quarter of 2024. 
 On June 27, 2023, the Company entered into a contribution agreement with Brookfield Corporate Treasury Ltd. and acquired the equity ownership in certain entities which beneficially own shares in Brookfield Real Estate Income Trust. The Company accounted for the acquired interests as equity method investments with fair value election. The fair value option has been elected to simplify the accounting for the investment in OCG NTR Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company NTR ). Changes in the fair value and cash dividends received from the investment in NTR are included in investment income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an equity investment gain of million and an equity investment loss of million, respectively . Please refer to note 14 for the detailed description of the transaction. 
 Each reporting period, the Company evaluates each of its equity-method investments to determine if any are considered significant, as defined by the SEC. As of September 30, 2024, or for the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined Oaktree Capital I met the significance criteria. No other individual equity method investment met the significance criteria.

 A significant amount of judgment may be required when using unobservable inputs, including assessing the accuracy of source data and the results of pricing models. The Company assesses the accuracy and reliability of the sources it uses to develop unobservable inputs.

 As of September 30, 2024, OCM, Oaktree Capital I, Oaktree Capital II, Oaktree AIF and OCM Cayman are co-obligors and jointly and severally liable for all debt obligations listed below, while the debt obligations are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements based upon the entity that actually made the borrowing and received the related proceeds. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company s financial statements no longer reflect debt obligations or related liabilities associated with Oaktree Capital I. 
 
 On April 7, 2023, OCM, Oaktree Capital I, Oaktree Capital II, Oaktree AIF and OCM Cayman (collectively, the Obligors entered into amendments to each of the note and guaranty agreements listed below for each series of outstanding senior notes issued by OCM and Oaktree Capital I. Pursuant to these amendments, OCM Cayman became a guarantor of each such series of senior notes. These amendments also amended certain provisions in these note and guaranty agreements, including financial definitions, in order to facilitate the joinder of OCM Cayman as an obligor. Additionally, the amendments for the note purchase agreements executed in 2014 and 2020 amended the assets under management covenants to clarify the treatment of entities that the Obligors account for using equity method accounting. On the same date that the note and guaranty agreement amendments took effect, OCM Cayman became a Borrower under the million revolving credit facility with OCM, Oaktree Capital I, Oaktree Capital II and Oaktree AIF pursuant to a joinder agreement executed by OCM Cayman as part of the Seventh Amendment to the credit facility. 
 
 On May 20, 2020, OCM entered into a note and guaranty agreement with certain accredited investors pursuant to which OCM agreed to issue and sell to such investors million of senior unsecured notes that bear a blended fixed rate of interest and a weighted average maturity of 2031. These notes are guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company prior to the 2024 Restructuring, along with Oaktree Capital II, Oaktree AIF and OCM Cayman, as co-obligors. The offering closed on July 22, 2020 and OCM received proceeds of million on the closing date. As OCM is the issuer of such senior notes, the outstanding principal and interest payments guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I were not included in the Company s financial statements as no event of default has occurred. 
 Oaktree Capital I, along with certain other Oaktree Operating Group members as co-borrowers, are parties to a credit agreement with a subsidiary of Brookfield that provides for a subordinated credit facility. The subordinated

 million and borrowings generally bear interest at a spread to either LIBOR or an alternative base rate. Borrowings on the subordinated credit facility are subordinate to the outstanding debt obligations and borrowings on the primary credit facility of Oaktree Capital I and its co-borrowers. Oaktree Capital I is jointly and severally liable, along with its co-obligors for outstanding borrowings on the subordinated credit facility. The Company s financial statements generally would not reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with the subordinated credit facility until such time as Oaktree Capital I (while it was still a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) directly borrows from it. In March 2022, this credit facility was amended to extend the revolving credit maturity date from May 19, 2023 to September 14, 2026. On October 6, 2023, an amendment was signed to further extend the maturity date to October 6, 2028 and change the interest rate to the SOFR plus or an alternative base rate plus . The amendment also provided that the maturity date will automatically extend annually in increments until the lenders notify the borrowers of their intention to terminate the subordinated credit facility. 
 
 On November 4, 2021, OCM entered into a note and guaranty agreement with certain accredited investors pursuant to which OCM agreed to issue and sell to such investors million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes due January 12, 2037. These notes are guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company prior to the 2024 Restructuring, along with Oaktree Capital II and Oaktree AIF, as co-obligors. The offering closed on January 12, 2022 and OCM received proceeds of million on the closing date. As OCM is the issuer of such notes, the outstanding principal and interest payments guaranteed by Oaktree Capital I were not included in the Company s financial statements as no event of default has occurred. 
 
 Oaktree s bank credit facility was amended on September 14, 2021 to among other things, (i) extend the maturity date from December 13, 2024 to September 14, 2026, (ii) modify the assets under management covenant threshold from billion of assets under management to billion of management-fee generating assets under management and (iii) increase the maximum leverage ratio to to 1.00. Oaktree s credit facility was further amended on December 15, 2022 to among other things, extend the maturity date from September 14, 2026 to December 15, 2027 with the potential to extend the maturity for up to two additional years, and implemented language consistent with U.S. syndicated loan market practice to use an adjusted forward-looking term rate based on the SOFR, as a replacement for the London Interbank Offered Rate. Based on the current credit ratings of OCM, the interest rate on borrowings is the term SOFR reference rate plus per annum and the commitment fee on the unused portions of the revolving credit facility is per annum. The term SOFR reference rate is determined by the tenor of the borrowings and set by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited (CBA). The credit agreement contains customary financial covenants and restrictions, including ones regarding a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum required level of assets under management (as defined in the credit agreement, as amended above). As of September 30, 2024, the revolving credit facility was no longer included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company because Oaktree Capital I was deconsolidated as a result of the 2024 Restructuring. 
 The fair value of the Company s debt obligations, which are carried at amortized cost, is a Level III valuation that is estimated based on a discounted cash-flow calculation using estimated rates that would be offered to Oaktree for debt of similar terms and maturities. The fair value of these debt obligations, gross of debt issuance costs, was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, utilizing average borrowing rates of as of December 31, 2023. 
 OCM and the Company were in compliance with all financial maintenance covenants associated with its senior notes and bank credit facility as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, Oaktree Capital I is jointly and severally liable, along with its co-obligors, for the debt obligations listed below. As of September 30, 2024, Oaktree Capital I is no longer consolidated in the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 The results of the Company are largely driven by the performance of certain funds and other investments held directly or indirectly by Oaktree Capital I, which is one of the key operating entities of Oaktree, and managed by Oaktree. The distributions to preferred unitholders of the Series A and Series B preferred units listed on the NYSE are generally serviced by the distributions from Oaktree Capital I, and payments to the preferred unitholders must be satisfied prior to declaration of any distributions to Class A or Class B unitholders, subject to the terms of the 
 Series A and Series B preferred units and certain limitations and exceptions set forth therein.

 Business Environment and Developments 
 The Company, Brookfield and Oaktree are affected by a wide range of factors, including the condition of the global economy and financial m arkets; the relative attractiveness of Brookfield and Oaktree s investment strategies and investors demand for them; and regulatory or other governmental policies or actions. Global economic conditions can significantly impact the values of fund investments and the ability to make new investments or sell existing investments for these funds. Historically, however, Brookfield and Oaktree s diversified nature, of both investment strategies and revenue mix, has generally allowed them to benefit from both strong and weak economic environments. Weak economies and the declining financial markets that typically accompany them tend to dampen revenues from asset-based management fees, investment realizations or price appreciation, but their prospect can present opportunities to raise relatively larger amounts of capital for certain strategies, especially opportunistic credit. Additionally, weak financial markets may also present more opportunities for funds to make investments at reduced prices. Conversely, strong financial markets generally increase the value of fund investments, which typically create favorable exit opportunities that enhance the prospect for incentive income and fund-related realized investment income proceeds for Oaktree and us. 
 The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, including global sanctions imposed on Russia, and conflict in the Middle East, create continued uncertainty and volatility in the global financial markets and economy and, as a result, may adversely impact Brookfield s and Oaktree s businesses and their funds and their respective portfolio companies

business. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any material risk to the stability of our condensed consolidated financial statements caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the conflict in the Middle East or the materiality of any effect such uncertainties may have on our business and operations. 
 There has been significant recent progress and developments in the area of generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, but the impact to our business of such evolving technology cannot be fully determined at this time. 
 Understanding Our Results Consolidation of Oaktree Funds 
 Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires us to consolidate entities in which we have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. A limited partnership or similar entity is a variable interest entity VIE if the unaffiliated limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. Most of the Oaktree funds are VIEs because they have not granted unaffiliated limited partners substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Company consolidates those VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. For entities that are not VIEs, consolidation is evaluated through a majority voting interest model. Please see note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report for more information. 
 As a result of the 2024 Restructuring, effected to facilitate the change of the general partner of Oaktree Capital I, the Company no longer controls Oaktree Capital I. Therefore, Oaktree Capital I was deconsolidated as of July 1, 2024. As such, certain Oaktree funds and CLOs which were consolidated by Oaktree Capital I are no longer consolidated by the Company. The Company continues to consolidate the respective vehicles through which interests are held in Oaktree Opportunities Fund XI, L.P. and Oaktree Opportunities Fund XII, L.P. as the Company remains the primary beneficiary. 
 Revenues 
 We earn interest and dividend income which is primarily earned by our consolidated funds from their investment holdings. 
 Historically, we had the potential to earn incentive income from many of the closed-end funds and certain evergreen funds managed by Oaktree in Oaktree Capital I s capacity as the general partner of those funds. These closed-end funds generally provide that we receive incentive income only after we have returned to our investors all of their contributed capital plus an annual preferred return, typically 8 . Once this occurs, we generally receive as incentive income 80 of all distributions otherwise attributable to our investors, and those investors receive the remaining 20 until we have received, as incentive income, 20 of all such distributions in excess of the contributed capital from the inception of the fund. Thereafter, all such future distributions attributable to our investors are distributed 80 to those investors and 20 to us as incentive income. As a result of the 2022 Restructuring, we were generally only entitled to earn one-third of the incentive income attributable to Oaktree Capital I in respect of our closed-end funds established in 2022 or later and in respect of incentive income from our evergreen funds earned subsequent to January 1, 2023. We were generally earning 100 of the incentive income attributable to Oaktree Capital I in respect of our closed-end funds established prior to 2022. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, 
 the Company no longer earns incentive income as a result of the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I. Rather the 
 economics resulting from Oaktree Capital I s right to earn incentive income are reflected in the Company s results 
 through investment income earned from the Company s approximately 72 equity method investment in Oaktree Capital I. 
 
 We earn revenue from investment income, which represents our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments. Historically, investment income was generally from Oaktree Capital I s capacity as general partner in Oaktree funds and as an investor in our CLOs and third-party managed funds and companies. Subsequent 
 to the 2024 Restructuring, we no longer earn investment income from the direct fund-related holdings of 
 Oaktree Capital I. Rather the economics resulting from Oaktree Capital I s investments are reflected in the Company s 
 investment income earned from the Company s approximately 72 equity method investment in Oaktree Capital I. 
 
 Our consolidated revenues reflect the elimination of all revenues, if any, related to funds that are consolidated 
 by the Company. 
 Please see Business Structure and Operation of Our Business Structure of Funds in our annual report for a detailed discussion of the structure of Oaktree funds.

Expenses 
 Compensation, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Compensation has historically primarily reflected compensation expense directly related to incentive income, which generally consists of percentage interests (sometimes referred to as points or an allocation of shares received upon the completion of a successful SPAC merger) that are granted to Oaktree investment professionals associated with the particular fund or SPAC that generated the incentive income, and secondarily, compensation directly related to investment income. There was no fixed percentage for the incentive income-related portion of this compensation, either by fund, SPAC or strategy. The percentage that consolidated incentive compensation expense represented of the particular period s consolidated incentive income may not have been meaningful because incentive income from consolidated funds or SPACs was eliminated in consolidation, whereas no incentive income compensation expense was eliminated in consolidation. 
 Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, the Company no longer earns incentive income as a result of the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I, and therefore will no longer record incentive compensation expense. Compensation and benefits following the 2024 Restructuring primarily reflects compensation to the Company s board of directors. 
 Subsequent to the 2022 Restructuring, general and administrative expenses generally includes costs related to outside auditors, tax professionals, derivative and hedging activity, and other general items related directly to the Company s operations. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring and deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I, the Company no longer directly incurs costs related to derivative and hedging activity. 
 Consolidated Fund Expenses 
 Consolidated fund expenses consist primarily of costs, expenses and fees that are incurred by, or arise out of the operation and activities of or otherwise are related to, our consolidated funds, including, without limitation, travel expenses, professional fees, research and software expenses, insurance, and other costs associated with administering and supporting those funds. Inasmuch as most of these fund expenses are borne by third-party investors, they reduce the investors interests in the consolidated funds and have no impact on net income or loss attributable to the Company. 
 As a result of the 2024 Restructuring, the Company deconsolidated Oaktree Capital I as of July 1, 2024. As such, certain Oaktree funds and CLOs which were consolidated by Oaktree Capital I are no longer consolidated by the Company. The Company continues to consolidate the respective vehicles through which interests are held in Oaktree Opportunities Fund XI, L.P. and Oaktree Opportunities Fund XII, L.P. as the Company remains the primary beneficiary. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense has historically primarily reflected the interest expense of the consolidated funds, as well as the interest expense of Oaktree and its operating subsidiaries. Subsequent to the 2022 Restructuring, our financial statements reflect debt obligations, interest expense or related liabilities associated with our operating subsidiary when Oaktree Capital I directly borrows under Oaktree s credit agreements, issues private placement notes or enters into another debt arrangement. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, as a result of the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I, the Company no longer records interest expense for debt obligations of Oaktree Capital I or funds that were consolidated due to interests held by Oaktree Capital I. 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Consolidated Funds Investments 
 Net realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds investments consists of realized gains and losses arising from dispositions of investments held by our consolidated funds. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds investments reflects both unrealized gains and losses on investments held by our consolidated funds and the reversal upon disposition of investments of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for those investments. 
 56 

Income Taxes 
 The Company is a publicly traded partnership. Because it satisfies the qualifying income test, it is not required to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes; rather it is taxed as a partnership. 
 The Company analyzes its tax filing positions for all open tax years in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns. If the Company determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve is established. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. The Company reviews its tax positions quarterly and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available. 
 The Oaktree funds are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and, consequently, no income tax provision has been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements because individual partners are responsible for their proportionate share of the taxable income. 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in our financial statements. These interests fall into two categories: 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. This category represents the economic interests of the unaffiliated investors in the consolidated funds, as well as the equity interests held by third-party investors in CLOs that had not yet priced as of the respective period end. The net income of these interests is primarily driven by the investment performance of the consolidated funds. In comparison to net income, this measure excludes our operating results and other items solely attributable to the Company. Following the 2024 Restructuring, with the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I, which acts as or controls the general partner of certain Oaktree funds and which holds a majority of Oaktree s investments in its funds, the funds consolidated by Oaktree Capital I are accounted for as part of the equity investment in Oaktree Capital I; and, 
 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. This category primarily represents the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH and OEP OCGH and other non-controlling interest ), as well as the economic interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. Subsequent to the 2022 Restructuring, this category includes only the OCGH and other non-controlling interest in Oaktree Capital I. The OCGH and other non-controlling interest is determined at the Oaktree Operating Group level based on the weighted average proportionate share of Oaktree Operating Group units held by OCGH and other unitholders. Inasmuch as the number of outstanding Oaktree Operating Group units corresponds with the total number of outstanding Class A, OCGH and OEP units, changes in the economic interest held by the OCGH and other unitholders are driven by our additional issuances of Class A, OCGH and OEP units, as well as repurchases and forfeitures of, and exchanges between, Class A, OCGH and OEP units. Certain of our expenses, such as income tax and related administrative expenses of Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC and the holding companies through which we hold interests in Oaktree Capital I, are solely attributable to the Class A unitholders. Please see note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report for additional information on the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, we no longer reflect the economic interest owned by OCGH and OEP. 
 Net Income Attributable to Preferred Unitholders 
 This category represents distributions declared, if any, on our preferred units. Please see note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information.

Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest and dividend income increased 28.1 million, or 32.3 , to 115.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 86.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in income from our investments in Opps XI and Opps XII, partially offset by the decrease in income due to deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I as a result of the 2024 Restructuring. 
 Incentive Income 
 Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, we no longer earn incentive income due to the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income decreased 0.2 million, or 0.8 , to 25.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 25.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I and its consolidated funds as a result of the 2024 Restructuring, partially offset by the income from the equity investment in Oaktree Capital I subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring. 
 Expenses 
 Incentive Income Compensation 
 Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, we no longer incur incentive income compensation expense due to the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense decreased 1.1 million, or 73.3 , to 0.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 1.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring. 
 
 Consolidated Fund Expenses 
 Consolidated fund expenses increased 4.7 million, or 31.5 , to 19.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 14.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to the general costs incurred by Opps XII, which was consolidated beginning the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the decrease due to deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I s consolidated funds as a result of the 2024 Restructuring. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 15.7 million, or 266.1 , to 21.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 5.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to interest on debt outstanding at Opps XII which was not consolidated in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Consolidated Funds Investments 
 Net realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds investments increased 18.4 million, from a gain of 14.1 million for the third quarter of 2023 to a gain of 32.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. The net realized gain during the third quarter of 2024 reflects our consolidated funds performance on investments sold and the increase is primarily due to Opps XI. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds investments increased 61.9 million, to a gain of 52.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, from a loss of 9.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the reversal of net realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds investments, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds investments increased 80.3 million, to a net gain of 
 59 

85.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, from a net gain of 4.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from our investments in Opps XI and Opps XII. 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated funds increased 86.3 million, to 139.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 53.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase reflected our consolidated funds performance attributable to third-party investors in each period. These effects are described in more detail under Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments above. 
 Net Income Attributable to Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC Class A Unitholders 
 Net income attributable to Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC Class A unitholders increased 11.7 million, or 46.6 , to 36.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 25.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting improved realized and unrealized performance of our consolidated funds investments and higher interest and dividend income. These effects are described in more detail under Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments and Interest and Dividend Income above. 
 
 60 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 Interest and Dividend Income 
 Interest and dividend income increased 126.0 million, or 51.1 , to 372.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, from 246.8 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in income from our investments in Opps XI and Opps XII partially offset by the decrease in income due to deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I as a result of the 2024 Restructuring. 
 Incentive Income 
 Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, we no longer earn incentive income due to the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income increased 24.6 million, or 69.5 , to 60.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, from 35.4 million for the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to increases in the values of our Credit investments. 
 Expenses 
 Incentive Income Compensation 
 Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, we no longer incur incentive income compensation expense due to the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense decreased 0.9 million, or 25.0 , to 2.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, from 3.6 million for the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring. 
 Consolidated Fund Expenses 
 Consolidated fund expenses increased 22.1 million, or 52.4 , to 64.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, from 42.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily due to the general costs incurred by Opps XII, which was consolidated beginning the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the decrease due to deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I consolidated funds as a result of the 2024 Restructuring. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 38.2 million, or 110.4 , to 72.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, from 34.6 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily due to interest on debt outstanding at Opps XII, and the CLO equity fund, neither of which were consolidated in the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by a decrease in interest incurred by Opps XI due to a lower debt balance. 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Consolidated Funds Investments 
 Net realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds investments decreased by 40.8 million, from a gain of 76.4 million for the first nine months of 2023 to a gain of 35.6 million for the first nine months of 2024. The net realized gain during the first nine months of 2024 reflects our consolidated funds performance on investments sold and the decline is primarily due to Opps XI and Opps XII. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation on consolidated funds investments increased 194.9 million, to an appreciation of 147.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, from a depreciation of 47.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the impact of the reversal of net realized gain (loss) on consolidated funds investments, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds investments increased 154.2 million, 
 61 

to a net gain of 183.3 million for the first nine months of 2024, from a net gain of 29.1 million for the first nine months of 2023, primarily resulting from our investment in Opps XI and Opps XII. 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated funds increased 195.4 million, to 336.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, from 141.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase reflected our consolidated funds performance attributable to third-party investors in each period. These effects are described in more detail under Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments above. 
 Net Income Attributable to Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC Class A Unitholders 
 Net income (loss) attributable to Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC Class A unitholders increased 93.8 million, or 162.6 , to net income of 151.5 million for the first nine months of 2024, from net income of 57.7 million for the first nine months of 2023, primarily reflecting improved unrealized performance of our consolidated funds investments and higher interest and dividend income. These effects are described in more detail under Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments and Interest and Dividend Income above.

GAAP Statement of Financial Condition (Unaudited) 
 We manage our financial condition without the consolidation of Oaktree and Brookfield funds. Since Oaktree s founding, Oaktree and, by extension, we have managed our financial condition in a way that builds our capital base and maintains sufficient liquidity for known and anticipated uses of cash. 
 The following table presents our unaudited condensed consolidating statement of financial condition: As of September 30, 2024 Oaktree and Operating Subsidiaries Consolidated Funds Eliminations Consolidated (in thousands) Assets: Cash and cash-equivalents 20,841 20,841 Corporate investments 2,278,639 (824,871) 1,453,768 Receivables and other assets 14,848 14,848 Assets of consolidated funds 5,477,007 5,477,007 Total assets 2,314,328 5,477,007 (824,871) 6,966,464 Liabilities and Capital: Liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses 1,085 1,085 Due to affiliates 200 200 Liabilities of consolidated funds 1,607,249 1,607,249 Total liabilities 1,285 1,607,249 1,608,534 Non-controlling redeemable interests in consolidated funds 3,044,887 3,044,887 Capital: Capital attributable to BOH preferred unitholders

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of Oaktree funds and the effect of normal changes in short-term assets and liabilities. Prior to the 2024 Restructuring, our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis involve (a) generating cash flow from operations, (b) generating realized income and return of principal from investment activities, including strategic investments in certain third parties, (c) funding capital commitments that we have made to Oaktree funds, (d) funding our growth initiatives, (e) distributing cash flow to our Class A unitholders and to OCGH and OEP, (f) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements, and (g) issuances of, and distributions made on, our preferred units. Subsequent to the 2024 Restructuring, our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis involve (a) generating realized income and return of principal from investment activities, (b) funding capital commitments that we have made to Oaktree funds, (c) distributing cash flow to our Class A unitholders, (d) issuances of, and distributions made on, our preferred units, and (e) equity contribution from the investors of the Company to fulfill certain contractual capital commitments to its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, the Company on an unconsolidated basis had 20.8 million of cash and cash-equivalents. 
 
 Ongoing sources of cash include distributions stemming from our equity method corporate investments. We primarily use distributions from our corporate investments to pay compensation and related expenses, service fees under the Services Agreement with OCM, and distributions. This same cash flow is also used to fund corporate investments. Subject to applicable law and certain consent rights contained in our operating agreement, pursuant to a covenant in our operating agreement Oaktree plans to cause its operating group entities to distribute, on a quarterly basis, at least 85 of its adjusted distributable earnings, as defined in our operating agreement, and we plan to distribute amounts we receive in respect of such distributions, less any tax and tax receivable obligations, to holders of our Class A units. Distributions from each Oaktree Operating Group entity may not be proportionate to its share of adjusted distributable earnings. 
 
 Distributions on the preferred units are discretionary and non-cumulative. We may redeem, at our option, out of funds legally available, at any time, in whole or in part, the Series A preferred units or the Series B preferred units, at a price of 25.00 per preferred unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date, without payment of any undeclared distributions. Holders of the preferred units have no right to require the redemption of the preferred units. 
 We have subscribed for a limited partner interest in, and made a capital commitment of, 750 million to Oaktree Opportunities Fund XI, L.P., a parallel investment vehicle thereof or a feeder fund in respect of one of the foregoing (such limited partner interest, the Opps XI Investment and such fund entities collectively, Opps XI ). In order to fund the Opps XI Investment, our sole Class A unitholder, or one of its affiliates, will contribute cash as a capital contribution (the Opps XI Investment Cash as and to the extent required to satisfy our obligations to Opps XI. We will use the Opps XI Investment Cash solely to fund the Opps XI Investment and satisfy our obligations in respect of Opps XI. Distributions from the Opps XI Investment are intended for the benefit of the Class A unitholder, subject to applicable law. Our preferred unitholders should not rely on distributions received by us in respect of the Company s Opps XI Investment for payment of distributions on or redemption of the preferred units. As of 
 64 

September 30, 2024, 637.5 million of the 750 million capital commitment was funded. 406.0 million of the investment interest was pledged as collateral for two non-recourse credit facilities of an affiliate. The potential exposure is limited to the pledged interests. 
 We have subscribed for a limited partner interest in, and made a capital commitment of, 750 million to Oaktree Opportunities Fund XII, L.P., a parallel investment vehicle thereof or a feeder fund in respect of one of the foregoing (such limited partner interest, the Opps XII Investment and such fund entities collectively, Opps XII ). In order to fund the Opps XII Investment, our sole Class A unitholder, or one of its affiliates, will contribute cash as a capital contribution (the Opps XII Investment Cash as and to the extent required to satisfy our obligations to Opps XII. We will use the Opps XII Investment Cash solely to fund the Opps XII Investment and satisfy our obligations in respect of Opps XII. Distributions from the Opps XII Investment are intended for the benefit of the Class A unitholder, subject to applicable law. Our preferred unitholders should not rely on distributions received by us in respect of the Company s Opps XII Investment for payment of distributions on or redemption of the preferred units. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has funded in the aggregate 37.5 million of the 750.0 million capital commitment. 
 On June 27, 2023, the Company entered into a contribution agreement (the Treasury Contribution Agreement with Brookfield Corporate Treasury Ltd. Treasury ). Treasury holds all of the outstanding Class A units of the Company. Pursuant to the Treasury Contribution Agreement, Treasury agreed to contribute to the Company an amount (the Contributed Amount equal to the value of BUSI II GP-C LLC, BUSI II-C L.P., BUSI II SLP-GP LLC and Brookfield REIT OP Special Limited Partner L.P. (collectively, and together with any additional entities that may become direct or indirect subsidiaries of NTR (as defined below) and that beneficially own shares of Brookfield REIT (as defined below), the REIT Entities ), including their indirect ownership in Brookfield Real Estate Income Trust Inc., a Maryland corporation Brookfield REIT ), as of June 30, 2023, and the Company agreed to contribute the Contributed Amount to OCG NTR Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company NTR ), in connection with the Company s indirect acquisition (the Acquisition of 100 of the interests in the REIT Entities. An amount of 307.0 million in respect of the Contributed Amount was contributed to the Company on June 27, 2023 (the Purchase Price and a true-up contribution of 13.9 million was made on July 31, 2023 (the True-Up Payment ). Also on June 27, 2023, the Company entered into a contribution agreement (the NTR Contribution Agreement with NTR whereby the Company contributed the Purchase Price to NTR and agreed to make a contribution in an amount equal to the True-Up Payment to NTR, and NTR agreed to use the Contributed Amount in connection with the Acquisition. On June 29, 2023, NTR entered into an agreement of purchase and sale (the Agreement of Purchase and Sale to effect the Acquisition, whereby NTR acquired 100 of the interests in the REIT Entities from BUSI II NTR Sub LLC in exchange for cash. The Acquisition was completed on June 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of NTR included in corporate investments was 304.3 million. 
 In connection with the Acquisition, on June 29, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the Restructuring Letter Agreement with Treasury whereby, among other things, the Company agreed that, notwithstanding any provision of the operating agreement of the Company to the contrary, Treasury will have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to make up to 200.0 million of additional capital contributions to the Company to be utilized in connection with the Company s indirect ownership of Brookfield REIT or any other matters with respect to the operations of NTR and the REIT Entities, and no vote, approval or other authorization will be required in connection with such additional capital contributions. Also on June 29, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the Indemnification Letter Agreement with BP US REIT LLC BP US whereby, among other things, BP US agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its members and the Company s and such members respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from any third-party claims brought against any of them related to the ownership, management or ongoing operating of the REIT Entities, and any subsidiaries thereof. 
 Consolidated Cash Flows 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows include our consolidated funds, despite the fact that we typically have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The assets of consolidated funds, on a gross basis, are larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds involve: 
 raising capital from third-party investors; 
 using the capital provided by us and third-party investors to fund investments and operating expenses; 
 financing certain investments with indebtedness; 
 65 

generating cash flows through the realization of investments, as well as the collection of interest and dividend income; and 
 distributing net cash flows to fund investors and to us. 
 Because our consolidated funds are either treated as investment companies for accounting purposes or represent CLOs whose primary operations are investing activities, their investing cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. We believe that we and each of the consolidated funds has sufficient access to cash to fund our and their respective operations in the near term. Subsequent to the 2022 Restructuring, the Company no longer consolidates CLOs whose direct ownership interests are held by OCM Cayman. As a result of the 2024 Restructuring, the Company no longer consolidates Oaktree Capital I, and the cash inflows and outflows related to Oaktree Capital I are now presented under the investing activities of BOH s cash flow. 
 Significant amounts from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are discussed below. 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities used 508.6 million and 288.7 million of cash for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts principally reflected net income (loss), purchases of securities, net of non-cash adjustments, and net realized and unrealized (gain) loss from consolidated fund investments in each of the respective periods as well as net purchases of securities of the consolidated funds. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities used 44.3 million and 354.8 million of cash for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Corporate investments in funds and companies of 36.8 million and 451.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisted of the following: Nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 (in thousands) Funds 115,781 720,001 Eliminated in consolidation 
 (79,025) (268,336) Total investments 
 36,756 451,665 
 
 Distributions and proceeds from corporate investments in funds and companies of 162.5 million and 96.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisted of the following: Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Funds 285,533 127,764 Eliminated in consolidation 
 (123,043) (30,856) Total proceeds 
 162,490 96,908 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities provided 0.9 billion and 0.7 billion of cash for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and included: (a) net distributions to non-controlling interests of 127.8 million and net contributions from non-controlling interests of 1.1 billion; (b) distributions to unitholders of 314.3 million and 158.0 million; (c) net capital contributions of 37.2 million and 582.0 million; and (d) payments of debt issuance costs of 3.4 million and 0.1 million. Additionally, the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included borrowings of 2.2 billion and 0.2 billion, respectively, and 0.9 billion and 1.0 billion of repayments, respectively, related to consolidated funds. 
 66 

Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 We expect to continue to make distributions to our preferred unitholders in accordance with their contractual terms and our Class A unitholders pursuant to our distribution policy for our common units as described in our operating agreement. In the future, subject to our operating agreement we may also issue additional units or debt and other equity securities with the objective of increasing our available capital. In addition, we may, from time to time, repurchase our preferred units in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, redeem our preferred units pursuant to the terms of their respective governing documents, or repurchase OCGH or OEP units. The distributions from our corporate investments, including the distributions from the equity investment in Oaktree Capital I, also provide the Company with ongoing cash inflow. 
 We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 Preferred Unit Issuances 
 On May 17, 2018, we issued 7,200,000 of our 6.625 Series A preferred units representing limited liability company interests with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per unit. The issuance resulted in 173.7 million in net proceeds to us. Distributions on the Series A preferred units, when and if declared by the board of directors of Oaktree, will be paid quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. Distributions on the Series A preferred units are non-cumulative. 
 On August 9, 2018, we issued 9,400,000 of our 6.550 Series B preferred units representing limited liability company interests with a liquidation preference of 25.00 per unit. The issuance resulted in 226.9 million in net proceeds to us. Distributions on the Series B preferred units, when and if declared by the board of directors of Oaktree, will be paid quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. Distributions on the Series B preferred units are non-cumulative. 
 Unless distributions have been declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment on the preferred units for a quarterly distribution period, during the remainder of that distribution period we may not repurchase any common units or any other units that are junior in rank, as to the payment of distributions, to the preferred units and we may not declare or pay or set apart payment for distributions on any common units or junior units for the remainder of that distribution period, other than certain Permitted Distributions (as defined in the unit designation related to the applicable preferred units (each, the Preferred Unit Designation )). 
 We may redeem, at our option, out of funds legally available, at any time, in whole or in part, the Series A preferred units or the Series B preferred units, at a price of 25.00 per preferred unit plus declared and unpaid distributions to, but excluding, the redemption date, without payment of any undeclared distributions. Holders of the preferred units have no right to require the redemption of the preferred units. 
 The preferred units are not convertible into Class A units or any other class or series of our interests or any other security. Holders of the preferred units do not have any of the voting rights given to holders of our Class A units, except that holders of the preferred units are entitled to certain voting rights under certain conditions. 
 67 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table sets forth information related to anticipated future cash payments as of September 30, 2024: Remainder of 2024 
 2025-2026 2027-2028 
 Thereafter Total (in thousands) Oaktree and Operating Subsidiaries: BOH limited partner commitments to Oaktree funds (1) 
 825,000 825,000 Consolidated Funds: Debt obligations payable

 26,741 50,930 77,671 Total 851,741 1,511,995 2,363,736 

(1) These obligations represent commitments by us to provide limited partner capital funding to Oaktree funds. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the 2024 column. Capital commitments are generally expected to be called over a period of several years. 
 (2) Interest obligations include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. Where applicable, current interest rates are applied to estimate future interest obligations on variable-rate debt. 
 In some of our service contracts or management agreements, we have agreed to indemnify third-party service providers or separate account clients under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has neither been included in the above table nor recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Please see note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report for information on our commitments and contingencies and notes 8 and 14 for information on our joint and several liability as co-obligors on certain debt obligations with affiliates of the Company. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. Our most significant assumptions and estimates are related to the valuation of our corporate investments and the investments of our consolidated funds. Following the 2024 Restructuring, with the deconsolidation of Oaktree Capital I, the Company no longer consolidates the VIEs that were consolidated by Oaktree Capital I and the consolidated funds of Oaktree Capital I. For a summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates, please see the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report. For a summary of our critical accounting policies, please see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our annual report. 
 Recent Accounting Developments 
 Please see note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report for information regarding recent accounting developments.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to a broad range of risks inherent in the financial markets in which we participate, including price risk, interest-rate risk, access to and cost of financing risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and foreign exchange-rate risk. Potentially negative effects of these risks may be mitigated to a certain extent by those aspects of our investment approach, investment strategies, fundraising practices or other business activities that are designed to benefit, either in relative or absolute terms, from periods of economic weakness, tighter credit or financial market dislocations. 
 Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our investments in Oaktree and Brookfield funds and our economic interest in Oaktree Capital I, which holds a general partner interest in certain Oaktree funds. The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities held by the funds, in which we are invested may fluctuate in response to changes in, among many factors, the fair value of securities, foreign-exchange rates, commodities prices and interest rates. 
 Price Risk 
 Impact on Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Consolidated Funds Investments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments, at fair value of 4.8 billion related to our consolidated funds. We estimate that a 10 decline in market values would result in a decrease in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the consolidated funds investments of 484.3 million. Of this decline, approximately 73.9 million would impact net income attributable to BOH Class A unitholders, with the remainder attributable to non-controlling interests. The magnitude of the impact on net income is largely affected by the percentage of our equity ownership interest. 
 Impact on Investment Income 
 Investment income or loss arises from our pro-rata share of income or loss from our investments. This inc ome is directly affected by changes in market risk factors. Based on investments held by our equity method investments as of September 30, 2024, a 10 decline in fair values of the investments held by Oaktree Capital I and Brookfield REIT would result in a 149.5 million decrease in the amount of investment income. These estimated effects are without regard to a number of factors that would be expected to increase or decrease the magnitude of the change to degrees that are not readily quantifiable, such as the timing of fund flows or the timing of new investments or realizations. 
 Exchange-rate Risk 
 Subsequent to the 2022 Restructuring and the deconsolidation of OCM Cayman, we no longer have foreign subsidiaries and the associated exchange rate risk related to those operations. At any point in time, some of the investments held by the funds we are directly and indirectly invested in may be denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies on an unhedged basis. Changes in currency rates could affect our revenues with respect to such fund investments; however, the degree of impact is not readily determinable because of the many indirect effects that currency movements may have on individual investments. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In such agreements, we depend on the respective counterparty to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting to reputable financial institutions the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions. In other circumstances, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. 
 Interest-rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company prior to consolidation of funds had no debt obligations outstanding and therefore changes in interest rates would have no impact. 
 Our consolidated funds have debt obligations, most of which accrue interest at variable rates. Changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that Oaktree funds in which Oaktree Capital I holds a general partner interest would have to make, impacting future earnings and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, 
 69 

the consolidated funds had 1.5 billion of principal or par value, as applicable, outstanding under these debt obligations. We estimate that interest expense relating to variable-rate debt would increase on an annualized basis by 14.6 million in the event interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points. 
 As credit-oriented investors, we are also subject to interest-rate risk through the securities we hold in our consolidated funds. A 100-basis point increase in interest rates would be expected to negatively affect prices of securities that accrue interest income at fixed rates and therefore negatively impact the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on consolidated funds investments. The actual impact is dependent on the average duration of such holdings. Conversely, securities that accrue interest at variable rates would be expected to benefit from a 100-basis point increase in interest rates because these securities would generate higher levels of current income and therefore positively impact interest and dividend income. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective at the reasonable assurance level to accomplish their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
