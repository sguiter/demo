 We provide certain customers with incremental up-front consideration, subject to clawback provisions, including Business Incentive Plan assets ("BIPs"), which is capitalized as a component of other assets and amortized over the estimated life of the contractual arrangement as a reduction of net sales. We do not receive a distinct service or good in return for these BIPs, but rather receive volume commitments and/or sole supplier status from our customers over the life of the contractual arrangements, which approximates a weighted average useful life. Substantially all of the termination clauses in these contractual arrangements include standard clawback provisions that are designed to enable us to collect monetary damages in the event of a customer's failure to meet its commitments under the relevant contract. BIPs are assessed for recoverability annually or more frequently when certain circumstances arise. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total carrying value of BIPs were million and million, respectively, and are presented within other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million, million, million and million, respectively, was amortized and reflected as reductions of net sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 million. The acquisition of CoverFlexx, a leading aftermarket coatings business focused on economy customers in North America, strengthens Axalta's position in the refinish economy customer segment and supports its broader growth strategy. The results of the business have been reported within our Performance Coatings segment since the acquisition date. The CoverFlexx acquisition was recorded as a business combination under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations , with identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. 
 At September 30, 2024, we have not finalized the purchase accounting related to the CoverFlexx acquisition and these amounts represent preliminary values. The allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year from the closing date of the acquisition as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Future cash expenditures related to the 2024 Transformation Initiative are expected to be approximately - million, inclusive of - million for capital expenditures to, among other things, shift manufacturing capacity or capabilities. The 2024 Transformation Initiative resulted in pre-tax charges of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily relates to employee severance and other exit costs. 
 The majority of the termination benefits were accounted for in accordance with the applicable guidance for Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits , whereby we accounted for termination benefits and recognized liabilities when the loss was considered probable that employees were entitled to benefits and the amounts could be reasonably estimated. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred costs of million, million, million and million, respectively, for termination benefits, net of changes in estimates.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, recorded for estimated insurance receivables within accounts and notes receivable, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets . Liabilities of million and million are recorded as other accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively . The recorded probable losses remain an estimate, and actual costs arising from this matter could be materially lower or higher depending on the actual costs incurred to repair the impacted products as well as the availability of additional insurance coverage.

 We are subject to various pending lawsuits, legal proceedings and other claims in the ordinary course of business, including civil, regulatory and environmental matters. These matters may involve third-party indemnification obligations and/or insurance covering all or part of any potential damage incurred by us. All of these matters are subject to many uncertainties and, accordingly, we cannot determine the ultimate outcome of the proceedings and other claims at this time. The potential effects, if any, on our condensed consolidated financial statements will be recorded in the period in which these matters are probable and estimable. Except as set forth in the "Operational Matter" section above, we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with proceedings or claims in excess of the amounts recorded would likely not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis but could have a material adverse impact in a particular quarterly reporting period. 
 We are involved in environmental remediation and ongoing compliance activities at several sites. The timing and duration of remediation and ongoing compliance activities are determined on a site by site basis depending on local regulations. The liabilities recorded represent our estimable future remediation costs and other anticipated environmental liabilities. We have not recorded liabilities at sites where a liability is probable but a range of loss is not reasonably estimable. We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded would likely occur over a period of time and would likely not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis but could have a material adverse impact in a particular quarterly reporting period.

 The higher effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the tax impacts of the 2024 Transformation Initiative pre-tax charges, as well as the 2023 favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, which did not repeat in 2024. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate due to various items that impacted the effective rate both favorably and unfavorably. We recorded unfavorable impacts for changes in the valuation allowance and for increases in unrecognized tax benefits. These adjustments were primarily offset by the favorable adjustments for earnings in jurisdictions where the statutory rate is lower than the U.S. Federal statutory rate. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s OECD Pillar Two framework that imposes, among other items, a minimum tax rate of 15 has been implemented by several jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor the implementation of Pillar Two by additional jurisdictions and will evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 days from each respective financing inception. These financing arrangements are included in the current portion of borrowings within the condensed consolidated balance sheets and at the time of issuance each transaction is treated as a non-cash financing activity within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Upon settlement of the financing, the cash outflow is classified as a financing activity within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Amounts outstanding under this program were million at September 30, 2023, including an amount related to purchases of property, plant and equipment. There were balances outstanding under this program at September 30, 2024. Cash outflows under this program were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We maintain a voluntary supply chain financing ("SCF") program with a global financial institution that allows a select group of suppliers to sell their receivables to the participating financial institution at the discretion of both parties on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the financial institution. The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the program are paid by us to the financial institution according to the terms we have with the supplier. Amounts outstanding under the SCF program were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We also participate in a virtual card program with a global financial institution, in which we pay supplier invoices on the due date using a Virtual Card Account ("VCA") and subsequently pay the balance in full days after the billing statement date of the VCA. The program allows for suppliers to receive accelerated payments for a fee at each supplier's discretion. Fees paid by our suppliers are negotiated directly with the financial institution without our involvement. Amounts outstanding under the VCA program were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The payment terms we have with our suppliers who participate in the SCF and VCA programs are consistent with the typical terms we have with our suppliers who do not participate. These financing arrangements are included in accounts payable within the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled million which reduced the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility as of such dates. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a margin of and are due June 2029. The letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility include million that secures Customer Obligation Guarantees at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Significant Transactions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we prepaid million of the outstanding principal amount of the 2029 Dollar Term Loans. As a result of these prepayments, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which comprised the proportionate write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discounts. 
 During March 2024, we entered into the Fourteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Fourteenth Amendment") to lower the interest rate spread applicable to the 2029 Dollar Term Loans, which continues to be based on SOFR, from to and to make related changes to effect such repricing. The other material terms of the Credit Agreement, including the outstanding principal amount and maturity date of the 2029 Dollar Term Loans, remained unchanged. As a result of the repricing, we recorded a million loss on financing-related costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount and fees incurred to complete the repricing. 
 During June 2024, we entered into the Fifteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Fifteenth Amendment"), to among other things, increase commitments available pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility from million to million and extend the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from May 2026 to June 2029, provided that such date would be accelerated in certain circumstances as set forth in the Credit Agreement and the Fifteenth Amendment. As a result, we recorded million of incremental deferred financing costs to other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 million, which was previously executed in 2023 and set to expire on March 31, 2024, was terminated early on March 27, 2024. Concurrently, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge interest rate exposures associated with the 2029 Dollar Term Loans. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company is required to pay the counter-party a stream of fixed interest payments at a rate of on million of notional value, and in turn, receives variable interest payments based on 3-month SOFR from the counter-party subject to a floor of . The interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and expires on September 30, 2025. This interest rate swap is marked to market at each reporting date and any unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and reclassified to interest expense in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 
 Gains and losses for hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis.

 operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: Performance Coatings and Mobility Coatings. The CODM reviews financial information at the operating segment level to allocate resources and to assess the operating results and financial performance for each operating segment. Our CODM is identified as the Chief Executive Officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. Our segments are based on the type and concentration of customers served, service requirements, methods of distribution and major product lines. 
 Through our Performance Coatings segment, we provide high-quality liquid and powder coatings solutions to both large regional and global original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and to a fragmented and local customer base. These customers comprise independent or multi-shop operator body shops as well as a wide variety of industrial manufacturers. We are one of only a few suppliers with the technology to provide precise color matching and highly durable coatings systems. The end-markets and reporting units within this segment are refinish and industrial. 
 Through our Mobility Coatings segment, we provide coatings technologies for light vehicle and commercial vehicle OEMs. These global customers are faced with evolving megatrends in electrification, sustainability, personalization and autonomous driving that require a high level of technical expertise. These OEMs require efficient, environmentally responsible coatings systems that can be applied with a high degree of precision, consistency and speed. The end-markets and reporting units within this segment are light vehicle and commercial vehicle. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by our CODM to evaluate financial performance of the operating segments and allocate resources and is therefore our measure of segment profitability in accordance with GAAP under ASC 280, Segment Reporting. Asset information is not reviewed or included with our internal management reporting. Therefore, we have not disclosed asset information for each reportable segment.

 (1) The primary measure of segment operating performance is Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and select other items impacting operating results. These other items impacting operating results are items that management has concluded are (1) non-cash items included within net income, (2) items the Company does not believe are indicative of ongoing operating performance or (3) non-recurring, unusual or infrequent items that have not occurred within the last two years or we believe are not reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that is used by management to evaluate business performance in comparison to budgets, forecasts and prior year financial results, providing a measure that management believes reflects the Company's core operating performance, which represents EBITDA adjusted for the select items referred to above. (a) Represents expenses and associated changes to estimates related to the prepayment, restructuring, and refinancing of our indebtedness, which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. (b) Represents expenses and associated changes to estimates related to employee termination benefits, consulting, legal and other employee-related costs associated with restructuring programs and other employee-related costs. These amounts are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. (c) Represents acquisition and divestiture-related expenses and integration activities associated with our business combinations, all of which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. (d) Represents costs related to the closure of certain manufacturing sites, which we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. (e) Represents impairment charges, which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. The losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to the decision to demolish assets at a previously closed manufacturing site during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and the then anticipated exit of a non-core business category in the Mobility Coatings segment during the three months ended March 31, 2023. (f) Represents foreign exchange losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, net of the impacts of our foreign currency instruments used to hedge our balance sheet exposures. (g) Represents the non-cash, non-service cost components of long-term employee benefit costs. (h) Represents non-cash impacts associated with stock-based compensation. (i) Represents costs related to certain environmental remediation activities, which are not considered indicative of our ongoing operating performance. (j) Represents costs for certain non-operational or non-cash losses (gains), unrelated to our core business and which we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Many statements made in the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of federal securities laws and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan, strategies and capital structure. These statements often include words such as "anticipated," "expect," "believe," "intended," "estimated," "projections," "could," "would," "may," "will," "future," "can," "assumptions," "potential," "possible," "strategy," and "forecasts" and the negative of these words or other comparable or similar terminology. We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections are subject to and involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, economic, competitive, governmental, geopolitical and technological factors outside of our control, as well as risks related to the execution of, and assumptions underlying, the 2024 Transformation Initiative, our acquisition of CoverFlexx, and our previously-announced three-year 2024-2026 strategy , that may cause our business, industry, strategy, financing activities or actual results to differ materially. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is available in "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in other documents that we have filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or projections. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors, including, but not limited to, those described in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and projections. 
 These forward-looking statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive and are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 
 General Business Highlights 
 Our net sales increased 2.0 , including an offsetting impact from currency fluctuations, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased net sales were driven by higher volumes of 1.8 , including the contribution from the Andr Koch acquisition completed in October 2023, and contributions of 0.5 from CoverFlexx, partially offset by lower average selling price and product mix of 0.2 . The following trends impacted our segment net sales performance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Performance Coatings: Net sales increased 2.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased net sales were driven by contributions of 0.8 from the CoverFlexx acquisition, higher sales volumes of 0.7 , including the contribution from the Andr Koch acquisition, higher average selling price and product mix of 0.5 and an offsetting impact from currency fluctuations. 
 Mobility Coatings: Net sales increased 1.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased net sales were driven by higher sales volumes of 3.8 , partially offset by lower average selling price and product mix of 1.4 and a headwind from unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.5 driven by fluctuations of the Brazilian Real and Chinese Yuan, partially offset by fluctuations of the Euro, compared to the U.S. Dollar.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 At September 30, 2024, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was 673 million, net of 22 million of letters of credit outstanding and 105 million of loans outstanding. All such availability may be utilized without violating any covenants under the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our senior notes (the "Senior Notes"). At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under other lines of credit. Our remaining available borrowing capacity under other lines of credit in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions totaled 60 million. 
 We, or our affiliates, at any time and from time to time, may purchase shares of our common stock or the Senior Notes, and may prepay our 2029 Dollar Term Loans, any loans outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility, or other indebtedness. Any such purchases of our common stock or Senior Notes may be made through the open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more redemptions, tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices, as well as with such consideration, as we, or any of our affiliates, may determine. 
 We have various supplier finance programs in place around the world. We partner with large banking institutions and utilize these programs to enhance our liquidity profile. Depending on the program, the liabilities under the program are classified either as accounts payable or current portion of borrowings on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our supplier financing programs are more fully described in Note 15 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 During February 2024, we announced a global transformation initiative intended to simplify the Company s organizational structure and enable us to be more proactive, responsive, and agile and to better serve our customers and to lower our cost base and improve financial performance and cash flow generation. Future cash expenditures related to the 2024 Transformation Initiative are expected to be approximately 95-135 million. We estimate that, once fully executed, the 2024 Transformation Initiative will yield net savings, inclusive of non-labor savings and costs for backfilling certain roles, of approximately 75 million on an annualized basis. We expect 10 million of the run-rate savings from the 2024 Transformation Initiative to be realized in 2024 and an incremental 30- 40 million to be realized in 2025 with the full run-rate expected to be realized during 2026. See Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 342 million. Net income before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items generated cash of 508 million. This was partially offset by net uses of working capital of 166 million, for which the most significant drivers were increases in prepaid expenses and other assets, inventories and accounts and notes receivable of 106 million, 54 million and 16 million, respectively, as well as decreases in accounts payable of 18 million. These outflows were driven primarily by payments of BIPs, increased production and timing of collections from and payments to customers and vendors. These outflows were partially offset by increases in other liabilities of 30 million largely driven by accruals related to the 2024 Transformation Initiative. 
 Net Cash Used for Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 374 million. The primary uses were 290 million for the acquisition discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, purchases of property, plant and equipment of 78 million and 21 million for the disbursements to customers for loans which primarily have a repayment period of five years, partially offset by proceeds of 10 million from interest proceeds from swaps designated as net investment hedges, which are discussed further in Note 17 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Net Cash Used for Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 90 million. The primary uses were purchases of our common stock of 100 million, prepayments of 80 million of the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and 75 million of the outstanding principal amount of the 2029 Dollar Term Loans, contractual debt repayments of 16 million and payments of 5 million for fees associated with repricing our 2029 Dollar Term Loans in March 2024 and increasing borrowing capacity and extending the maturity date of our Revolving Credit Facility in June 2024. The 2029 Dollar Term Loans repricing resulted in 107 million of constructive financing cash inflows and corresponding constructive financing cash outflows. The primary financing inflow was from borrowing 185 million against our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Other Impacts on Cash 
 Currency exchange impacts on cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were unfavorable by 10 million, which was driven primarily by the fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and Brazilian Real compared to the U.S. Dollar. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 289 million. Net income before deducting depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items generated cash of 479 million. This was partially offset by net uses of working capital of 190 million, for which the most significant drivers were increases in accounts and notes receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets of 213 million and 68 million, respectively, driven primarily by the timing of collections and payments of BIPs. These outflows were partially offset by decreases in inventories of 66 million as a result of lower production levels due to intentionally managing inventory levels, and increases in accounts payable of 17 million. 
 Net Cash Used for Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 65 million. The primary use was for purchases of property, plant and equipment of 105 million, partially offset by proceeds of 38 million from settlements on, and interest from, swaps designated as net investment hedges. 
 Net Cash Used for Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 252 million. The primary uses were prepayments of 150 million of the outstanding principal amount of the 2029 Dollar Term Loans, contractual repayments of 52 million on borrowings, purchases of our common stock totaling 50 million, payments of 9 million for fees associated with refinancing our 2024 Dollar Term Loans and repricing our 2029 Dollar Term Loans and payments totaling 8 million for acquisition-related consideration, partially offset by proceeds of 9 million from a short-term borrowing and 7 million net cash received from our stock-based compensation program. The 2029 Dollar Term Loans repricing in August 2023 resulted in 197 million of constructive financing cash inflows and corresponding constructive financing cash outflows. 
 Other Impacts on Cash 
 Currency exchange impacts on cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were unfavorable by 19 million, which was driven primarily by the fluctuations of the Euro and Russian Ruble, partially offset by the Mexican Peso, compared to the U.S. Dollar.

 Financial Condition 
 We had cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of 567 million and 700 million, respectively. Of these balances, 457 million and 462 million were maintained in non-U.S. jurisdictions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe at this time our organizational structure allows us the necessary flexibility to move funds throughout our subsidiaries to meet our operational and working capital needs. 
 Our business may not generate sufficient net cash provided by operating activities and future borrowings may not be available under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including planned capital expenditures. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, selling additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Based on our forecasts, we believe that net cash provided by operating activities, available cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other existing lines of credit will be adequate to service debt, fund our cost saving initiatives, meet liquidity needs and fund necessary capital expenditures for the next twelve months. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness or to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other current obligations will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations. Such cash generation is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 If required, our ability to raise additional financing and our borrowing costs may be impacted by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our highly leveraged nature may limit our ability to procure additional financing in the future and elevated interest rates, as experienced during 2022 and 2023 and continuing in 2024, may further increase our interest expense and weaken our financial condition. 
 The following table details our borrowings outstanding at the dates indicated: 
 (In millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 2029 Dollar Term Loans 1,702 1,786 Revolving Credit Facility 105 2027 Dollar Senior Notes 500 500 2029 Dollar Senior Notes 700 700 2031 Dollar Senior Notes 500 500 Short-term and other borrowings 55 62 Unamortized original issue discount (13) (17) Unamortized deferred financing costs (24) (27) Total borrowings, net 3,525 3,504 Less: Short-term borrowings 3 7 Current portion of long-term borrowings 17 19 Long-term debt 3,505 3,478 
 Our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Notes and short-term borrowings, is more fully described in Note 16 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We believe that we continue to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations as well as our working capital needs. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was 673 million and 528 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, all of which may be borrowed by us without violating any covenants under the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing the Senior Notes. 
 During March 2024, we entered into the Fourteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to lower the interest rate spread applicable to the 2029 Dollar Term Loans, which continues to be based on SOFR, from 2.50 to 2.00 and to make related changes to affect such repricing. The other material terms of the Credit Agreement, including the outstanding principal amount and maturity date of the 2029 Dollar Term Loans, remained unchanged. See Note 16 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.

 During June 2024, we entered into the Fifteenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, to among other things, increase commitments available pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility from 550 million to 800 million and extend the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from May 2026 to June 2029, provided that such date would be accelerated in certain circumstances as set forth in the Credit Agreement and the Fifteenth Amendment. See Note 16 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 During June 2024, in connection with the acquisition discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we borrowed 185 million against the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Information related to our material contractual obligations and cash requirements can be found in Note 6 and Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As noted above and within Note 16 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have made prepayments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 75 million of the outstanding principal amount of the 2029 Dollar Term Loans. During June 2024, we borrowed 185 million against the Revolving Credit Facility, of which 80 million was repaid at September 30, 2024. There have been no other material changes in the Company's contractual obligations and cash requirements as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 See Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for disclosure of our guarantees of certain customers obligations to third parties. 
 Recent Accounting Guidance 
 See Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of recent accounting guidance. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and re-evaluate them on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes in the market risks previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. No matter how well designed and operated, disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

We do not expect that any currently pending lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on us as discussed in Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 SEC regulations require disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Consistent with SEC rules, we will be using a threshold of 1 million for such proceedings. At this time, the Company is not aware of any matters that exceed this threshold and that meet the other conditions for disclosure pursuant to this requirement. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
