 and continues thereafter from year to year if approved annually by the Board of Directors or the Company s unitholders, including, in each case, a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the Independent Directors ).

 The Company pays the Investment Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are ultimately be borne by the unitholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average net asset value at the end of the two most recently completed calendar months. All or part of the base management fee not taken as to any month will be deferred without interest and may be taken in any subsequent month prior to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, and any such recoupment would be subject to any applicable expense waiver.

 and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, base management fees were and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, was payable to the Investment Adviser relating to base management fees. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee consists of two components that are determined independently of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. One component is based on income and the other component is based on capital gains. 
 i. Incentive Fee based on Income 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter, including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below) and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred units, but excluding the incentive fee and any servicing fees and/or distribution fees paid to broker dealers. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Investment Adviser is not obligated to return any incentive fee it receives on PIK interest that is later determined to be uncollectible in cash. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to its pre-incentive fee net investment income as follows: 
 No incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed a hurdle rate of annualized); 
 of pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any quarter annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with approximately of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 of the pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized), which reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of the Company s all pre-incentive fee net investment income is paid to the Investment Adviser. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income-based incentive fees were and , net of waiver, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income-based incentive fees were and , net of waiver, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, was payable to the Investment Adviser relating to income-based incentive fees. 
 ii. Incentive Fee based on Capital Gains 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined on realized capital gains calculated and payable in arrears in cash as of the end of each calendar year or upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement in an amount equal to of the realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Company s election to be regulated as a BDC through the end of a given calendar year or upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees (the Cumulative Capital Gains ). 
 Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an incentive fee on capital gains, including unrealized capital appreciation even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not included in calculating the incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records an incentive fee on capital gain incentive fee equal to of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. If such amount is negative, no accrual is recorded for such period. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were capital gains incentive fees accrued to the Investment Adviser. 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement does not include unrealized capital appreciation for purposes of calculating the amount payable to the Investment Adviser. Amounts due related to unrealized capital appreciation, if any, will not be paid to the Investment Adviser until realized under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and determined based on the calculation. Incentive fees on Cumulative Capital Gains crystallize at calendar year-end.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are a non-diversified, externally managed specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We are a private, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose units are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. We use the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration whose units are intended to be sold by us monthly on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to our monthly net asset value per Unit. We are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, which means that we are not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we may invest in securities of a single issuer. We are externally managed by the Adviser, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. We are not a subsidiary of, or consolidated with, Morgan Stanley. 
 Our investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns via current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by investing primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans issued by U.S. middle-market companies in which private equity sponsors have a controlling equity stake in the portfolio company. For the purposes of this Report, middle-market companies refers to companies that, in general, generate annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA in the range of approximately 15 million to 200 million, although not all of our portfolio companies will meet this criterion. 
 We invest primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans, including first lien senior secured term loans (including unitranche loans) and second lien senior secured term loans, with the balance of our investments expected to be in higher-yielding assets such as mezzanine debt, unsecured debt, equity investments and other opportunistic asset purchases. Typical middle-market senior loans may be issued by middle-market companies in the context of leveraged buyouts LBOs ), acquisitions, debt refinancings recapitalizations, and other similar transactions. We generally expect our debt investments to have a stated term of five to eight years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark (such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR). We also make investments in traded bank loans and other liquid debt securities of U.S. corporate issuers, including broadly syndicated loans, which may provide more liquidity than our private credit investments, for cash management purposes, including to manage payment obligations under our unit repurchase program. Depending on various factors, including our cash flows and the market for middle-market company debt investments, we expect that our liquid loan portfolio could represent a material portion of our investments from time to time. 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on any direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of loans and equity investments and various other loan origination and other fees, including commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Pursuant to the exemptive relief granted by the SEC to us and our Adviser (as amended, the Order ), we are able to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the Order) in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies, and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with the Order. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our eligible directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our unitholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. 
 We have applied for a new exemptive relief order which, if granted, would supersede the Order and would permit us greater flexibility with respect to negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the application). There can be no assurance that we will obtain such new exemptive relief from the SEC. 
 
 On July 15, 2024, we acquired SL Investment Corp., or SLIC, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, dated as of May 28, 2024, by and among SLIC, us, Cobalt Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of us, and the Adviser. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, SLIC was merged with and into us in a two-step transaction with us as the surviving company, or the Merger.

 KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle-market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR, or historically LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees, including base management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory agreement between us and our Investment Adviser (the Investment Advisory Agreement (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement between us and MS Private Credit Administrative Services LLC (the Administrator and (iii) other operating expenses as detailed below:

 (1) Calculated as a percentage of gross debt commitments (funded and unfunded). Weighted average EBITDA, net leverage through the tranche that the Company is a lender and loan to value exclude recurring revenue investments, which are investments in portfolio companies in which the Company lends based on a multiple of recurring revenue generated by the portfolio company and not based on a multiple of EBITDA. 
 (2) Amounts were derived from investment due diligence information provided by the portfolio company. Such amounts have not been independently estimated by us, and accordingly, we take no responsibility for such numbers and make no representation or warranty in respect of this information. 
 (3) Computed as (a) the annual stated spread, plus reference rate, as applicable, plus the annual accretion of discounts, as applicable on debt securities divided by (b) total debt investments (at fair value or cost, as applicable) included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented herein. 
 (4) Excludes liquid loan portfolio. 
 (5) Net leverage is the ratio of total debt minus cash divided by EBITDA and taking into account leverage through the tranche that the Company is a lender, excluding recurring revenue investments. 
 (6) Interest coverage for a particular portfolio company is calculated by taking credit agreement EBITDA and dividing by annualized latest reported interest expense. Total interest coverage is calculated on a weighted average basis based on total gross debt commitments (funded and unfunded). Calculation excludes recurring revenue deals which are investments in portfolio companies in which the Company lends based on a multiple of recurring revenue generated by the portfolio company and not based on a multiple of EBITDA. Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. 
 (7) Calculated using total outstanding debt through the tranche that the Company is a lender divided by total enterprise value from the private equity sponsor or market comparables.

 (3) In July 2024, in connection with the Merger, we acquired investments of 1,101.38 million at fair value from SLIC and assumed unfunded loan commitments totaling 95.46 million. The investments received consisted of 148 portfolio companies across 29 industries. The impact of this transaction is excluded from the information presented in the table. For additional information see Note 11 SLIC Acquisition in our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments. Our Investment Adviser has developed a classification system to group investments into four categories. The investments are evaluated regularly and assigned a category based on certain credit metrics. Our Investment Adviser s ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any

 third-party assessment of any of our investments. Please see below for a description of the four categories of the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating system: 
 Risk Rating 1 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 1 involve the least amount of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 1 investments performance is above our initial underwriting expectations and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company, or the likelihood of a potential exit. 
 Risk Rating 2 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 2 involve a level of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 2 investments are generally performing in line with our initial underwriting expectations and risk factors to ultimately recoup the cost of our principal investment are neutral to favorable. All new originated or acquired investments are initially included in Risk Rating 2. 
 Risk Rating 3 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 3 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition has increased materially since the origination or acquisition of the investment, such as declining financial performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, principal and interest payments are not more than 120 days past due. 
 Risk Rating 4 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 4 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicate that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For Risk Rating 4 investments, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition upon exit. 
 The distribution of our portfolio on the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating System is as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fair Value of Total Fair Value of Total Risk rating 1 5,926 0.2 Risk rating 2 5,559,698 97.6 3,150,012 98.5 Risk rating 3 138,962 2.4 21,501 0.7 Risk rating 4 (1) 18,047 0.6 5,698,660 100.0 3,195,486 100.0

 In the table above, interest and other financing expenses, including unused commitment fees, amortization of debt issuance costs and deferred financing costs, increased from 21,604 and 52,615 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 55,271 and 110,611 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by our increased borrowings. Our debt outstanding (at par) increased from 1,014,448 as of September 30, 2023 to 2,694,416 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Base Management Fee 
 The base management fees were 9,677 and 5,554 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 26,620 and 14,519 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in capital contributions. For more information on base management fee, including terms thereof, for further details, see Note 3 Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 Incentive Fees

Table of Contents 

 The income-based incentive fees net of waiver were 12,045 and 6,999 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 27,400 and 16,949 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income. For more information on incentive fee, including terms thereof, for further details, see Note 3 Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 Professional Fees, Administrative Service Fee and Other Expenses 
 Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company, which include costs of a financial printer utilized for certain preparation, printing and distribution services related to the offering materials. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers that perform duties for us. General and other expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs. Organization and offering costs include expenses incurred in our initial formation and our offering of units. 
 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments 
 For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Realized and unrealized gain (loss): Net realized gain (loss): Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments (21,608) 31 (25,381) 73 Foreign currency and other transactions 3 2 (11) 2 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation): Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments 5,005 19,488 9,374 39,707 Translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies 20 (9) (17) (9) Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) (16,580) 19,512 (16,035) 39,773 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net realized losses on our investments was 21,608 and 25,381, respectively, which was primarily due to the restructuring of one and five portfolio companies, respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments of 5,005 and 9,374, respectively, was primarily driven by changes in spreads in the primary and secondary markets, partially offset by the reversal of unrealized depreciation in connection with the aforementioned restructuring. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments of 19,488 and 39,707, respectively, was primarily the result of the changes in spreads in the primary and secondary markets. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our Units, net borrowings from our credit facilities and unsecured debt, and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of any closing of our continuous private offering of our Units. Our primary use of cash is investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, funding repurchases under our unit repurchase program and payment of cash distributions to our unitholders. Details of our credit facilities are described in Debt below. We may also from time to time enter into new credit facilities, increase the size of existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 207.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, which taken together with our approximately 1,040.7 million, 351.8 million, 281.3 million and 641.9 million of availability under the ING Facility, Wells Funding Facility, CBNA Funding Facility and JPM Funding Facility (subject to borrowing base availability) (each as defined in Note 6. Debt in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), respectively, we expect to be sufficient for our investing activities and sufficient to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we believed we had adequate financial resources to satisfy unfunded portfolio company commitments of 1,053.8 million.

 We have adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan DRIP ). As a result, unless unitholders elect to opt out of the DRIP, unitholders will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional units of same class of units to which the distribution relates, rather than receiving cash. Unitholders who receive distributions in the form of Units will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, those unitholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes.

The limitations and restrictions described in the applicable offer to repurchase units may prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any quarter. The unit repurchase program has many limitations, including the limitations described above, and should not in any way be viewed as the equivalent of a secondary market. We will offer to repurchase Units on such terms as may be determined by our Board of Directors in its complete and absolute discretion. 
 The following table further summarizes the unit repurchases completed for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, including Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Deferred Financing Costs and Debt Issuance Costs and Income Taxes. The valuation of investments is our most significant critical estimate. The most significant input is the discount rate used in yield analysis that is based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in the discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. For a further discussion and disclosure of key inputs and considerations related to this estimate, refer to Note 5 "Fair Value Measurements" included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following (which are defined in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements if not defined herein): 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 the Administration Agreement; 
 the Placement Agent Agreement; 
 the MSDI Agreement; and 
 the Expense Support Agreement. 
 For further details, see Note 3 Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 MS Credit Partners Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, has entered into subscription agreements and has made capital contributions at the closings of the Company s continuous private offering representing an aggregate capital contribution of 25.0 million, in exchange for 1,256,051 Units. Because MS Credit Partners Holdings, Inc. has made an aggregate capital contribution of 25.0 million as of the date of this Report, MS Credit Partners Holdings, Inc. has no further obligation, contractual or otherwise, to support us. Morgan Stanley has no history of financially supporting any of the BDCs on the MS Private Credit platform, even during periods of financial distress. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, market risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of portfolio companies. During periods of market dislocation, we will seek to invest prudently in the secondary loan market to provide our investors better risk adjusted returns while adhering to our core investment tenants. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price. To ensure accurate valuations, our investments are valued at fair value in good faith by our Board of Directors, based on, among other things, the input of the Investment Adviser, including the Valuation Designee, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of our Board of Directors, or Valuation Designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the investments we hold. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Market Risk 
 The market value of a security may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. These fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than the price originally paid for it, or less than it was worth at an earlier time. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, sector of the economy or the market as a whole. Global economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, which increases the probabilities that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact issuers in a different country or region. Conditions affecting the general economy, including political, social, or economic instability at the local, regional, or global level, may also affect the market value of a security. Health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, as well as other incidents that interrupt the expected course of events, such as natural disasters, war or civil disturbance, acts of terrorism, power outages and other unforeseeable and external events, and the public response to or fear of such diseases or events, have and may in the future have an adverse effect on a company s investments and net asset value and can lead to increased market volatility. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors General Risk Factors We are operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. The

Risk Factors General Risk Factors Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, outbreaks or pandemics, such as the Coronavirus pandemic, may impact our portfolio companies and our Adviser and harm our business, operating results and financial condition of our Form 10-K. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 99.9 of our debt investments were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical reference rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate debt instruments assuming no changes in our investments and borrowing structure as of September 30, 2024) (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Interest Interest Net Basis Point Change - Interest Rates Income Expense (1) 
 Income Up 300 basis points 168,860 (80,832) 88,028 Up 200 basis points 112,573 (53,888) 58,685 Up 100 basis points 56,287 (26,944) 29,343 Up 25 basis points 14,072 (6,736) 7,336 Down 25 basis points (14,072) 6,736 (7,336) Down 100 basis points (56,287) 26,944 (29,343) Down 200 basis points (112,573) 53,888 (58,685) Down 300 basis points (168,860) 80,832 (88,028) 
 (1) Includes the impact of our interest rate swaps as a result of interest rate changes. 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or our credit facilities, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Report), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company, the Investment Adviser, and the Administrator may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A of the Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks disclosed in the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 Refer to Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8. Members Capital in this Report, the Form 10-K and our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on July 30, 2024, August 28, 2024 and September 26, 2024, for the issuance of our Class S Units for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Such issuances were part of our continuous private offering and were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D thereunder. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 At the discretion of the Board of Directors, we have in the past and may in the future conduct quarterly repurchase offers pursuant to a unit repurchase program. The purpose of the unit repurchase program is to provide liquidity to unitholders. We intend to limit the number of Units to be repurchased in each quarter to no more than 5 of our outstanding Units (either by number of Units or aggregate net asset value) as of such quarter end. All Units purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be unissued Units. Any Units to be purchased from any of our officers, directors or affiliates will be on the same terms and conditions as any other purchase of Units. 
 On August 8, 2024, we announced a quarterly tender offer that commenced on August 9, 2024 and ended at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on September 7, 2024 (the Offer ). Because there is no secondary trading market for our Units, our Board of Directors determined, after consideration of various matters, that the Offer was in the best interests of unitholders in order to provide liquidity for our unitholders. Approximately 1,980,872 of our Units were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer. The Units were repurchased at a price of 19.00 per Unit, which represents the net asset value per Unit as of September 30, 2024. The payment of the purchase price of the Units tendered was promptly made in cash issued to the unitholders whose tenders were accepted for purchase by us in accordance with the terms of the Offer. 
 The following table sets forth information regarding repurchases of Units during the three months ended September 30, 2024:

Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 3.01(h) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not, except for its own actions under this Agreement, have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Company. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Company, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.
