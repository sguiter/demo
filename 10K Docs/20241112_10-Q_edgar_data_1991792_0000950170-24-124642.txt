 All issued and outstanding shares of common stock, stock option awards and per share data have been adjusted in these condensed financial statements, on a retrospective basis, to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. The par value of the common stock and preferred stock was not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. The shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock options and other equity instruments were proportionately reduced and the respective exercise prices, if applicable, were proportionately increased in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such securities. In addition, the conversion ratios for each series of the Company s redeemable convertible preferred stock, which automatically converted into shares of common stock upon the closing of the offering, were proportionally adjusted. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split received a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares. On January 29, 2024, the Company completed the closing of its initial public offering (IPO) of common shares at a price of per share. Additionally, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional at a price of per share. The common shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on January 25, 2024, under the symbol "CGON". The Company received net proceeds of million, after deducting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In addition, as a result of its IPO, the Company s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into common stock concurrently with the IPO. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Because all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements are not included herein, these unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes accompanying them should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Annual Report). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal and recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim periods. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Liquidity and Management s Plans As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital of approximately million . The Company has a relatively limited operating history, and the revenue and income potential of the Company s business and market are unproven. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net losses of million and million , respectively, and negative cash flows from operations of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company will continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to its ongoing operations until it successfully develops, obtains regulatory approval, and gains market acceptance of a product candidate and achieves a level of revenues adequate to support the Company s operations.

Legal Proceedings A liability for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources is recorded in the condensed financial statements if it is determined that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and that the amount (or range) of the loss can be reasonably estimated. On March 4, 2024, a complaint was filed against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware by ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. seeking a declaratory judgment that an assignment and technology transfer agreement between the Company and ANI, dated November 15, 2010, obligates the Company to pay ANI a royalty on certain "net sales" of cretostimogene. The Company disputes the allegations raised in the case and is vigorously defending the matter. Indemnification In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with officers and members of its board of directors that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations, and claims with respect thereto were outstanding.

 million and is obligated to make regulatory milestone payments of up to million and commercial milestone payments of up to million. The Company is entitled to receive a high single-digit royalty on net sales of cretostimogene and/or DDM sold in the Lepu Territory, subject to a specified reduction. Lepu s royalty obligations will expire upon termination of the Lepu License Agreement. The Company assessed the Lepu License Agreement in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition (ASC 606) and determined that the performance obligation is comprised solely of the license grant to Lepu. The Company determined the transaction price was million and recorded the entire amount upon transfer of control of the functional intellectual property license rights in 2019. The Company evaluated the provision of manufacturing activities related to clinical and commercial supply of the licensed products and concluded that the manufacturing activities were not performance obligations as the terms do not provide a material right to Lepu. Future milestone payments are fully contingent as the risk of significant revenue reversal will only be resolved depending on future regulatory approval and sales level outcomes. The Company will re-evaluate the likelihood of achieving future milestones at the end of each reporting period. The sales-based royalty fee is considered variable consideration and will be recognized as revenue as such sales occur. The sales-based royalty fee qualifies for the royalty constraint exception and does not require an estimate of the future transaction price. The Company recorded and less than million in research and collaboration revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded million and less than million in research and collaboration revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. In March 2020, and amended as of September 2022, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Kissei (the Kissei License Agreement). Under the terms of the Kissei License Agreement, the Company granted to Kissei an exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (the Kissei Territory), for Kissei to develop and commercialize, but not manufacture, cretostimogene in combination with DDM (the Licensed Product) for all uses in oncology indications for which marketing approval is being sought. Under the Kissei Agreement, the Company and Kissei agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to collaborate on clinical development activities in the Kissei Territory and each party is responsible for conducting the applicable activities pursuant to an agreed development plan. Kissei is responsible for the costs of developing the Licensed Product in the Kissei Territory, and the Company is responsible for the costs of developing the Licensed Product outside the Kissei Territory (Global Development), provided that Kissei is responsible for a low-double digit percentage and the Company is responsible for a high-double digit percentage of the cost of development activities that cannot be attributed solely to the Kissei Territory or outside the Kissei Territory. The Company is obligated to supply and Kissei will exclusively purchase its clinical and commercial requirements of Licensed Product from the Company. Kissei is responsible for commercializing the Licensed Product in the Kissei Territory and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize at least one Licensed Product in a specified indication. Until a certain period of time has passed after the first regulatory approval of the Licensed Product, the Company is prohibited from commercializing certain competing products worldwide and Kissei is prohibited from researching, developing or commercializing certain competing products worldwide.

 million one-time upfront payment and, in connection with entry into this agreement, Kissei purchased million worth of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock as part of the Company s Series D financing. Kissei is obligated to make development and regulatory milestone payments to the Company of up to million and commercial milestone payments of up to million. The Company has agreed to pay Kissei a royalty on net sales of Licensed Product outside the Kissei Territory and outside the Lepu Territory (as described above), including on any U.S. sales, in a low-single digit percentage, subject to certain capped reductions. The Company is entitled to receive a royalty on net sales of Licensed Product in the Kissei Territory in the mid-twenties percentage, subject to certain capped reductions. Also, Kissei has the right to offset the royalty payments due to the Company with respect to the cost for the supply of Licensed Product sold by the Company to Kissei, and to indefinitely carryforward credits for any excess supply amounts paid over royalty amounts owed in a given quarter. The Company is entitled to receive a specified minimum percentage of royalties on net sales of a given Licensed Product in a given country and a given quarter, unless, if for such Licensed Product in such country and such quarter, Kissei has taken the maximum allowable reductions and the ratio of the cost for the supply of Licensed Product to the sales price for Licensed Product exceeds a low-double digit percentage threshold, then the Company shall receive royalties on the net sales of such Licensed Product in such country and such quarter. Kissei s and the Company s royalty obligations will expire on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis on the later of twelve years from the date of first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such country or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such Licensed Product in such country. The Kissei Agreement will expire on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis when there is no remaining royalty or milestone payment obligation due to a party with respect to such Licensed Product in such country. Following expiration of the Kissei Agreement in its entirety, the licenses the Company granted to Kissei will become non-exclusive, fully-paid royalty-free and irrevocable and Kissei will have the right to negotiate directly with the Company's product suppliers for the direct supply of Licensed Product to Kissei. The Kissei Agreement may be terminated either by Kissei or by the Company in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the other party becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. In addition, the Company have the right to terminate the Kissei Agreement in the event that Kissei commences a legal action challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patents under the Kissei Agreement. Kissei may terminate the Kissei Agreement at will upon specified written notice. Additionally, Kissei may terminate the Kissei Agreement for the Company's willful and malicious misconduct that results in substantial and irreparable harm to the commercial value of the Licensed Products in the Kissei Territory and upon any such termination, the licenses the Company granted to Kissei will become royalty-free and fully paid-up and Kissei will have the right to negotiate directly with the Company's contract manufacturing organizations for the supply of Licensed Product. Upon termination of the Kissei Agreement for any other reason all rights and licenses granted to Kissei to develop and commercialize the product under the Kissei Agreement will terminate, subject to certain rights to sell existing inventory of Licensed Products by Kissei and its sublicensees. Upon termination of the Kissei Agreement for Kissei s breach, any sublicenses granted by Kissei may, upon the Company s discretion, continue. The Company evaluated the Kissei Agreement to determine whether it is a collaborative arrangement in the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808). The Company concluded the Kissei Agreement is a collaborative agreement under ASC 808, as the Kissei Agreement involves a joint operating activity, each party is an active participant in the activities related to the Kissei Agreement, and both parties are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent upon the commercial success of the activities related to the Kissei Agreement. The Company determined the Kissei Agreement contained two material components: (i) an exclusive license granted to Kissei to certain intellectual property rights in the Kissei Territory, for Kissei to develop and commercialize, but not manufacture, the Licensed Product for all uses in oncology; and (ii) the parties participation in the Global Development of the Licensed Product. The Company used the criteria specified in ASC 606 to determine which of the components of the Kissei Agreement are performance obligations with a customer and concluded Kissei is the Company s customer for the license and related activities in the Kissei Territory under ASC 606. The Global Development activities under the agreement does not present a transaction with a customer and the payments received by the Company for Global Development activities, including manufacturing, will be accounted for as a reduction of related expenses.

In 2022, the Company established the 2022 Plan, under which the Company may grant options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and other stock and cash-based awards to its employees and certain non-employees. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the 2022 Plan. On January 11, 2024, the Company s board of directors and stockholders approved the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan), which became effective on the date immediately preceding the date on which the Company s registration statement was declared effective by the SEC. The 2024 Plan replaced the 2022 Plan, as the Company s board of directors has determined to not make additional grants under the 2022 Plan following the closing of the offering. However, the 2015 and 2022 Plan will continue to govern outstanding equity awards granted under the 2015 and 2022 Plans. The 2024 Plan allows the Company to make equity-based and cash-based incentive awards to its officers, employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares initially available for issuance under awards granted pursuant to the 2024 Plan is (1) shares, plus (2) any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2015 Plan and 2022 Plan as of the effective date of the 2024 Plan that become available for issuance under the 2024 Plan thereafter in accordance with its terms. As of September 30, 2024 , there were shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards and shares of common stock remaining and available for issuance under the 2024 Plan. The Company may grant options to purchase authorized but unissued shares of the Company s common stock. Options granted under the 2015 Plan, 2022 Plan and 2024 Plan include incentive stock options that can be granted only to the Company s employees and non-statutory stock options that can be granted to the Company s employees, consultants, advisors and directors. The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions of the awards granted under the 2015 Plan, 2022 Plan and 2024 Plan are determined by the Board, except that no stock option may be issued with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock at the date of the grant or have a term in excess of ten years.

 Overview 
 We are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a potential backbone bladder-sparing therapeutic for patients afflicted with bladder cancer. Our product candidate, cretostimogene, is in clinical development for the treatment of patients with high-risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) who are unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy, the current standard-of-care for high-risk NMIBC. There is significant unmet need for treatments in these patients given the limitations of currently approved therapies and patient reluctance to undergo radical cystectomy, or the complete removal of the bladder. We are evaluating the safety and efficacy of cretostimogene as monotherapy in BOND-003 Cohort C, our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in high-risk BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients with CIS and with or without high-grade Ta/T1 papillary disease. We have completed enrollment for this trial and reported interim data in May 2024. In September 2024, we submitted a late-breaking abstract reporting data from BOND-003 to the Society of Urologic Oncology that was accepted for an oral presentation at its Annual Scientific Meeting in Urologic Oncology scheduled for December 2024. If successful, we believe that this trial could serve as the basis for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In April 2024, we initiated BOND-003 Cohort P evaluating cretostimogene in high-risk BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients with high-grade Ta/T1 papillary disease. The first patient has been dosed in BOND-003 Cohort P. In addition, in our CORE-001 Phase 2 clinical trial, we evaluated the use of cretostimogene when administered to the BOND-003 Cohort C population in combination with FDA-approved pembrolizumab, and reported positive final results from the CORE-001 trial in May 2024. Moreover, we intend to assess the safety and efficacy of cretostimogene in treating a range of other bladder cancer indications as an alternative to BCG therapy and in patients who are not categorized as high-risk BCG-unresponsive, including our second Phase 3 clinical trial, PIVOT-006, evaluating adjuvant cretostimogene in up to 364 intermediate-risk NMIBC patients following transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). In June 2024, we initiated an expanded access program (EAP) for cretostimogene in the U.S. for patients with NMIBC who are unresponsive to BCG and meet certain program eligibility criteria. The first patient has been dosed in the EAP and enrollment in the study is ongoing. We believe cretostimogene, if approved, has the potential to serve as first-line therapy, thereby alleviating the current need to prioritize treatment recipients and ration administration of BCG given its significant market shortage. 
 Since our inception in 2010, we have focused substantially all of our resources on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of cretostimogene, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. Our net losses were 56.2 million and 32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 186.2 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and, to a lesser extent, from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses in the foreseeable future, and we anticipate these losses will increase substantially as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and potentially commercialize cretostimogene and potentially seek to discover and develop additional product candidates, utilize third parties to manufacture cretostimogene, hire additional personnel, expand and protect our intellectual property, and incur additional costs associated with being a public company. If we obtain regulatory approval for cretostimogene, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we do not become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 
 To date, we have primarily funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of common shares from our IPO, our redeemable convertible preferred stock and previously outstanding term debt. From inception through September 30, 2024, we have received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 749.8 million from the sale of common shares from our IPO and sales of redeemable convertible preferred stock. In addition, from inception through September 30, 2024, we have recognized 25.7 million in research and collaboration revenue pursuant to our license and collaboration agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 540.7 million. Our ability to generate any product revenue and, in particular, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of cretostimogene and any future product candidates. 
 16 

CG ONCOLOGY, INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

 Based on our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2027. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. In addition, we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for cretostimogene or any future product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and may never occur. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including current or potential future collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements or arrangements as, and when needed, we may delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, or even cease operations. 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of cretostimogene for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we rely on third parties to package, label, store, and distribute cretostimogene, and we intend to rely on third parties for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment, and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of cretostimogene. 
 In January 2024, we completed our initial public offering of 23,000,000 common shares at a price of 19.00 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of 399.6 million, after deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In addition, as a result of our initial public offering, our redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into common stock concurrently with the initial public offering. 
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Below is a summary of the key terms for certain of our license and collaboration agreements. For a more detailed description of these agreements, see the section titled Business License and Collaboration Agreements in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Lepu License Agreement 
 In March 2019, we entered into a development and license agreement (the Lepu License Agreement) with Lepu, under which we granted an exclusive license to Lepu to develop, manufacture and commercialize cretostimogene and/or DDM to treat and/or prevent cancer in the Lepu Territory. Lepu paid to us a one-time upfront payment of 4.5 million and is obligated to make regulatory milestone payments of up to 2.5 million and commercial milestone payments of up to 57.5 million. We are entitled to receive a high single-digit royalty on net sales of cretostimogene and/or DDM sold in the Lepu Territory, subject to a specified reduction. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, zero and less than 0.1 million in research and collaboration revenue was recorded related to the Lepu License Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 0.5 million and less than 0.1 million in research and collaboration revenue was recorded related to the Lepu License Agreement, respectively. 
 17 

CG ONCOLOGY, INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

 Kissei License Agreement 
 In March 2020, and as amended September 2022, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the Kissei License Agreement) with Kissei, under which we granted to Kissei an exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (the Kissei Territory), for Kissei to develop and commercialize, but not manufacture, cretostimogene in combination with DDM (the Licensed Product) for all uses in oncology. Kissei paid to us a one-time upfront payment of 10.0 million under the agreement. Kissei is obligated to pay development milestone payments of up to 33.0 million and commercial milestone payments of up to 67.0 million. We have also agreed to pay Kissei a royalty on net sales of Licensed Product outside the Kissei Territory and outside the Lepu Territory, including on any U.S. sales, in a low-single digit percentage, subject to certain capped reductions. We are entitled to receive a royalty on net sales of Licensed Product in the Kissei Territory in the mid-twenties percentage, subject to certain capped reductions and offset rights. We are obligated to supply and Kissei will exclusively purchase its clinical and commercial requirements of Licensed Product from us. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, all research and collaboration revenue recorded was related to the Kissei License Agreement, with no research and collaboration revenue related to the Kissei License Agreement recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 0.2 million and 0.2 million in research and collaboration revenue was recorded related to the Kissei License Agreement, respectively. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 From inception through September 30, 2024, we have recognized 25.7 million in research and collaboration revenue through our license and collaboration agreements. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of products, however, and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future, if at all. If our or our collaborators development efforts for cretostimogene and any future product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, payments from existing or potential future collaboration or license agreements with third parties, or any combination thereof. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development (R D) expenses consist primarily of external and internal costs incurred in performing clinical and preclinical development activities. 
 Our R D expenses consist of: 
 external costs incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturers, consultants and other third parties to conduct and support our clinical trials and preclinical studies; and 

internal costs, including R D personnel-related expenses such as salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, as well as allocated facilities costs and dues and subscriptions. 

We expense R D costs as incurred. We currently only have one product candidate, cretostimogene. Therefore, since our inception, substantially all of our R D costs were related to the development of cretostimogene. We track R D expenses on an aggregate basis and not on an indication-by-indication or treatment setting-by-treatment setting basis. 
 18 

CG ONCOLOGY, INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

 Although R D activities are central to our business model, the successful development of cretostimogene and any future product candidates is highly uncertain. There are numerous factors associated with the successful development of any product candidate such as cretostimogene, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future regulatory factors beyond our control may impact our clinical development programs. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect our R D expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned clinical and preclinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of cretostimogene and any future product candidates. Our future R D expenses may vary significantly based on a wide variety of factors such as: 
 the number and scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies of cretostimogene and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, including any modifications to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities; 

per patient trial costs; 

the number of trials required for approval; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 

the number of patients that participate in the trials; 

the number of doses that patients receive; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 

the potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; 

the cost and timing of manufacturing cretostimogene and any future product candidates; 

the costs, if any, of obtaining third-party drugs for use in our combination trials; 

the extent of changes in government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the efficacy and safety profile of cretostimogene and any future product candidates; 

the timing, receipt, and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; and 

the extent to which we establish additional collaboration, license, or other arrangements. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of cretostimogene or any future product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidate. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses such as salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, for our personnel in executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and professional fees paid for accounting, auditing, consulting and tax services, as well as facilities-related costs not otherwise included in R D expenses and other costs such as insurance costs and travel expenses. 
 19 

CG ONCOLOGY, INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

 We anticipate our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially in the future as we expand our operations, including increasing our headcount to support our continued R D activities and preparing for potential commercialization of cretostimogene. We also anticipate we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance, and investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net, consists of interest income related to interest earned on our invested cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and expenses related to our previously outstanding term debt. We expect our interest income will increase as we invest the cash received from the net proceeds from our IPO. 
 Other (Expense) Income 
 Other (expense) income consists of miscellaneous items, such as success fees and final payment amortization and other items not related to our core operations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses in the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of cretostimogene and any future product candidates. To date, we have primarily funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in our initial public offering, the sale of shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and previously outstanding term debt. Through September 30, 2024, we have received aggregate gross proceeds of 749.8 million from the sale of common stock in our IPO and sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock. In addition, through September 30, 2024, we have recognized 25.7 million in research and collaboration revenue through our license and collaboration agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 540.7 million. On January 29, 2024, we closed our initial public offering of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of 399.6 million, after deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for, and potentially commercialize cretostimogene and potentially seek to discover and develop additional product candidates, conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials and preclinical studies, continue our R D activities, utilize third parties to manufacture cretostimogene, hire additional personnel, expand and protect our intellectual property, and incur additional costs associated with being a public company. 
 Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses, and prepaid expenses. The timing and amount of our funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the initiation, type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies of cretostimogene and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, including the costs of modification to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities and any third-party products used as combination agents in our clinical trials 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory meetings and reviews of cretostimogene or any future product candidates, including requirements of regulatory authorities in any additional jurisdictions in which we may seek approval for cretostimogene and any future product candidates; 

the costs of obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and protecting our patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal control over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our business grows, including additional executive officers and clinical development, regulatory, CMC quality and commercial personnel; 

the timing and payment of milestone, royalty or other payments we must make pursuant to our existing and potential future license or collaboration agreements with third parties; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if cretostimogene or any future product candidate is approved; 

our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage, and adequate reimbursement from third- party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

our ability and strategic decision to develop future product candidates other than cretostimogene, and the timing of such development, if any; 

patients willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; and 

23 

CG ONCOLOGY, INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

 costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire. 

Based upon our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2027. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. In addition, we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 We have no other committed sources of capital. Until such time, if ever, we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including current or potential future collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, engaging in acquisition, merger or collaboration transactions, selling or licensing our assets, making capital expenditures, redeeming our stock, making certain investments or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or license agreements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, or even cease operations. 
 Material Cash Requirements for Known Contractual and Other Obligations 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business in the composition to the material contractual obligations or commitments discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Material Cash Requirements for Known Contractual and Other Obligations included in the 2023 Annual Report.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our condensed financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates included in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 R D Expenses and Related Prepaid and Accrued Expenses 
 As part of the process of preparing our condensed financial statements, we are required to estimate our R D expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. We make estimates of our R D expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. The significant estimates in our R D expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with services for which we have not yet been invoiced. We base our expenses related to R D activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct R D on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. 
 There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the R D expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future R D activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. 
 Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 A description of recently issued accounting standards that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows is included in Note 2 to our condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes surrounding our market risk, including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and inflation risk, from the discussion provided in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures. 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Lega l Proceedings. 
 On March 4, 2024, a complaint was filed against us in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware by ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. seeking a declaratory judgment that an assignment and technology transfer agreement between us and ANI, dated November 15, 2010, obligates us to pay ANI a royalty on certain "net sales" of cretostimogene. We dispute the allegations raised in the case and are vigorously defending the matter. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to other legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. There have been no material developments to the legal proceedings disclosed in Part II, Item 1, "Legal Proceedings" in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales o f Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 None. 
 Use of Proceeds 
 On January 24, 2024, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-276350) was declared effective by the SEC for our initial public offering. At the closing of our initial public offering on January 29, 2024, we sold 23,000,000 shares of common stock, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 3,000,000 additional shares, at an initial public offering price of 19.00 per share and received gross proceeds of 437.0 million, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately 399.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 30.6 million and offering-related transaction costs of approximately 6.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that we have used approximately 49.2 million of the proceeds from our initial public offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the research and development of cretostimogene, and manufacturing and pre-commercial activities. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from that described in the final prospectus for our initial public offering filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
