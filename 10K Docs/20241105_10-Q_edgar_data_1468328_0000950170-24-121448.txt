Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in the ASU require, among other things, disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to an entity s chief operating decision maker CODM and a description of other segment items (the difference between segment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss) by reportable segment, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Annual disclosures are required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim disclosures are required for periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is required, and is permitted. These requirements will result in expanded disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and allows for .

 million, payable in full in cash at the closing, subject to typical adjustments for working capital and other customary items (collectively, the Gentiva Acquisition ). The acquired business operates in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, and serves approximately patients. The Company expects to close this acquisition following completion of regulatory approvals and subject to customary closing conditions and fund it through the Company s existing revolving credit facility and a portion of the net proceeds from the Public Offering. Divestiture On May 21, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to sell all of the Company s New York operations for a purchase price of up to million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments for future operating requirements (the New York Asset Sale ). The Company entered into a consulting agreement with the purchaser on May 21, 2024, as the transfer of clients and caregivers and payment for assets pursuant to the New York Asset Sale is occurring over time as regulatory approvals are received, coordination of the transfer of clients and caregivers occurs, and the change of control takes place. In connection with this transaction, the Company will cease operations in New York. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded million and million in consulting fees, respectively, and received a million initial payment on the acquisition. The New York Asset Sale did not qualify as a discontinued operation because it did not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operation or financial results. As of May 21, 2024, the Company s New York personal care operations met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The carrying value does not exceed the fair market value and will result in a gain on divestiture once the transaction closes. See Note 14 to the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Subsequent Events , for additional details regarding the treatment of the New York Asset Sale.

Additionally, the law provided for a percentage point increase in federal matching funds for Medicaid home and community-based services HCBS from April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022, provided the state satisfied certain conditions. States are permitted to use the state funds equivalent to the additional federal funds through March 31, 2025. States must use the monies attributable to this matching fund increase to supplement, not supplant, their level of state spending for the implementation of activities enhanced under the Medicaid HCBS in effect as of April 1, 2021. HCBS spending plans for the additional matching funds vary by state, but common initiatives in which the Company is participating include those aimed at strengthening the provider workforce (e.g., efforts to recruit, retain, and train direct service providers). The Company is required to properly and fully document the use of such funds in reports to the state in which the funds originated. Funds may be subject to recoupment if not expended or if they are expended on non-approved uses.

The sequestration adjustment resumed with a reduction beginning April 1, 2022, and a reduction beginning July 1, 2022. These sequestration cuts have been extended through April 2032. The ARPA increased the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggers an additional statutorily mandated sequestration under the PAYGO Act.

Segment operating income consists of revenue generated by a segment, less the direct costs of service revenues and general and administrative expenses that are incurred directly by the segment. Unallocated general and administrative costs are those costs for functions performed in a centralized manner and therefore not attributable to a particular segment. These costs include accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, corporate office support and facility costs and overall corporate management.

 Overview 
 We are a home care services provider operating three segments: personal care, hospice and home health. Our services are principally provided in-home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our consumers are predominantly dual eligible, meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Managed care organizations accounted for 34.3 and 36.5 of our net service revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 35.1 and 36.6 of our net service revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, we provided our services in 22 states through 214 offices. We served approximately 80,000 and 62,000 discrete individuals, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities. 
 Acquisitions 
 In addition to our organic growth, we have grown through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets, with the goal of having all three levels of in-home care in our markets or facilitating our entry into new markets where in-home care has been moving to managed care organizations. 
 On January 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of CareStaff for approximately 1.0 million, with funding provided by available cash. With the purchase of CareStaff, the Company expanded its personal care services in Florida. 
 On August 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care for approximately 111.2 million, with funding primarily provided by drawing on the Company s revolving credit facility. With the purchase of Tennessee Quality Care, the Company expanded its services within its hospice and home health segments to Tennessee. 
 On March 9, 2024, we completed our acquisition of the operations of Upstate for 0.4 million, with funding provided by available cash. With the purchase of Upstate, the Company expanded its personal care services segment in South Carolina. 
 On June 8, 2024, we entered into the Gentiva Purchase Agreement to acquire the personal care operations of Gentiva, consisting of equity interests and certain assets and liabilities, for a purchase price of approximately 350.0 million, payable in full in cash at the closing, subject to typical adjustments for working capital and other customary items. The acquired business operates in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, and serves approximately 16,000 patients. The Company expects to close this acquisition following completion of regulatory approvals and subject to customary closing conditions and will fund this acquisition through the Company s existing revolving credit facility and a portion of the net proceeds from the Public Offering. 
 New York Asset Sale 
 On May 21, 2024, we entered into the New York Asset Sale. The Company entered into a consulting agreement as the transfer of clients and caregivers and payment for assets pursuant to the New York Asset Sale is occurring over time as regulatory approvals are received, coordination of the transfer of clients and caregivers occurs, and the change of control takes place. In connection with this transaction, the Company will cease operations in New York. See Note 14 to the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Subsequent Events , for additional details regarding the New York Asset Sale. 
 Recruiting 
 As the labor market continues to be tight and unemployment remains at low levels, the competition for new caregivers, including skilled healthcare staff, and support staff continues to be significant. In recent periods, the United States economy has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant inflationary pressures. To the extent that we continue to experience a shortage of caregivers, it may hinder our ability to fully meet the continuing demand for both our non-clinical and clinical services.

 Revenue by Payor and Significant States 
 Our payors are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which the agencies operate are subject to legislative and budgetary changes and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. We are experiencing a transition of business from government payors to managed care organizations, which we believe aligns with our emphasis on coordinated care and the reduction of the need for acute care. 
 Our revenue by payor and significant states by segment were as follows:

The personal care segment derives a significant amount of its net service revenues in Illinois, which represented 38.6 and 38.9 of our net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and accounted for 38.5 and 39.2 of our net service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 A significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from one payor, the Illinois Department on Aging, the largest payor program for our Illinois personal care operations, which accounted for 21.4 and 20.5 of our net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and accounted for 21.1 and 21.2 of the Company s net service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Changes in Reimbursement Rates 
 Illinois 
 The City of Chicago requires the Chicago minimum wage to be adjusted annually based on increases in the Consumer Price Index CPI ), subject to a cap and other requirements. On July 1, 2024, the rate was adjusted to 16.20 based on the increase in the CPI. 
 The Illinois fiscal year 2023 budget included an increase of hourly rates for in-home care services to 25.66, to be effective January 1, 2023. This increase offsets the 0.40 increase in Chicago minimum wage that occurred on July 1, 2022. In addition, CMS approved a waiver amendment proposal submitted by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services with regard to its Persons who are Elderly program, further increasing in-home care rates to 26.92, effective March 1, 2023. 
 The Illinois Medicaid omnibus legislation passed in June 2023 included an increase in hourly rates for in-home care services to 28.07, which took effect on January 1, 2024 and required a minimum wage rate of 17.00 per hour. CMS approved an amendment to the Illinois HCBS Waiver for Persons Who are Elderly, which included the rate increase for in-home care services to 28.07, effective January 1, 2024. 
 The Illinois fiscal year 2025 budget includes an increase in hourly rates for in-home care services to 29.63, to take effect January 1, 2025, subject to federal approval. This rate supports the required minimum wage of 18.00 per hour for direct service workers. 
 Our business will benefit from the rate increases noted above as planned for 2025, but there is no assurance that there will be additional rate increases in Illinois for fiscal years beyond fiscal year 2025 to offset increases to minimum wage, and our financial performance will be adversely impacted for any periods in which an additional offsetting reimbursement rate increase is not in effect.

 Impact of Changes in Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement 
 Hospice 
 Hospice services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid under the Medicare Hospice Prospective Payment System, under which CMS sets a daily rate for each day a patient is enrolled in the hospice benefit. CMS updates these rates each federal fiscal year. Effective October 1, 2024, CMS increased hospice payment rates by 2.9 . This reflects a 3.4 market basket increase and a negative 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. Hospices that do not satisfy quality reporting requirements are subject to a 4-percentage point reduction to the market basket update. 
 Overall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number are subject to an inpatient cap and an aggregate cap, which is set each federal fiscal year. The inpatient cap limits the number of days of inpatient care to no more than 20 of total patient care days. The aggregate cap, which limits the total Medicare reimbursement that a hospice may receive based on an annual per-beneficiary cap amount and the number of Medicare patients served, was updated to 34,465.34 for federal fiscal year 2025. If a hospice s Medicare payments exceed its inpatient or aggregate caps, it must repay Medicare the excess amount.

 Home health services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid under the Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment System HHPPS ), which uses national, standardized 30-day period payment rates for periods of care that meet a certain threshold of home health visits (periods of care that do not meet the visit threshold are paid a per-visit payment rate for providing care). Although payment is made for each 30-day period, the HHPPS permits continuous 60-day certification periods through which beneficiaries are verified as eligible for the home health benefit. The daily home health payment rate is adjusted for case-mix and area wage levels. CMS uses the Patient-Driven Groupings Model PDGM as the case-mix classification model to place periods of care into payment categories, classifying patients based on clinical characteristics and their resource needs. An outlier adjustment may be paid for periods of care where costs exceed a specific threshold amount. 
 CMS updates the HHPPS payment rates each calendar year. For calendar year 2024, CMS estimates that Medicare payments to home health agencies will increase by 0.8 . This is based on a home health payment update percentage of 3.0, which reflects a 3.3 market basket update reduced by a productivity adjustment of negative 0.3 percentage points, and an estimated 2.6 decrease associated with the transition to the PDGM, among other changes. Home health providers that do not comply with quality data reporting requirements are subject to a 2-percentage point reduction to their market basket update. In addition, Medicare requires home health agencies to submit a one-time Notice of Admission NOA for each patient that establishes that the beneficiary is under a Medicare home health period of care. Failure to submit the NOA within five calendar days from the start of care will result in a reduction to the 30-day period payment amount for each day from the start of care date until the date the NOA is submitted. 
 CMS began implementing a nationwide expansion of the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing HHVBP Model in 2022. Under the HHVBP Model, home health agencies receive increases or decreases to their Medicare fee-for-service payments of up to 5 based on performance against specific quality measures relative to the performance of other home health providers. Data collected in each performance year will impact Medicare payments two years later. Calendar year 2023 was the first performance year under the expanded HHVBP Model, which will affect payments in calendar year 2025. 
 In certain states, payment of claims may be impacted by the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services, a program intended to identify and prevent fraud, reduce the number of Medicare appeals and improve provider compliance with Medicare program requirements. The program currently applies to home health agencies in certain states, including Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Florida and Texas. Providers in states subject to the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services may initially select either pre-claim review or post-payment review. Previously, providers could also opt for minimal post-payment review with a 25 payment reduction, but CMS has removed this option. Providers that had selected the minimal post-payment review option transitioned to pre-claim or post-payment review in mid-July. Home health agencies that maintain high compliance levels are eligible for additional options that may be less burdensome. This program has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

 The IMPACT Act required the Department of Health and Human Services HHS ), together with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission MedPAC ), to consider and propose a unified payment system for post-acute care services provided by home health agencies, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, skilled nursing facilities and long-term care hospitals. A unified post-acute care payment system would pay post-acute care providers under a single framework according to a patient s characteristics, rather than based on the post-acute care setting where the patient receives treatment. As required under the statute, CMS and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation issued a report in July 2022 presenting a prototype for a unified post-acute care payment model, and MedPAC submitted a report to Congress in June 2023 evaluating a prototype design. Although both CMS and MedPAC concluded that designing a unified payment system is feasible, CMS noted that universal implementation of a unified payment system would require congressional action and MedPAC cautioned that implementation would be complex. Due to the agency resources required to implement a unified model, MedPAC noted that CMS may consider smaller-scale site-neutral policies to address some of the overlap in patients treated in different settings and highlighted that recent changes to various post-acute care payment systems address some of the concerns underlying the push for a unified model. 
 New York Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program CDPAP 
 The CDPAP is a self-directed care alternative program that allows eligible individuals who need help with activities of daily living or skilled nursing services to choose their caregivers. We provide support services as a CDPAP fiscal intermediary. The Company recognized approximately 9.3 million and 30.3 million in revenue from the program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and 10.2 million and 30.6 million in revenue from the program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The selection process for CDPAP fiscal intermediaries has changed significantly in recent years and the program continues to be an area of focus for New York governmental authorities. As a result of the changes and uncertainty in the state, the Company determined that its New York personal care operations no longer fit its growth strategy and reached an agreement to divest these operations. See Note 4 to the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisition and Divestiture, for additional details regarding our divestiture. 
 CMS Final Rule: Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services 
 On April 22, 2024, CMS announced a final rule intended to improve access to services and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries across fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems. The final rule includes significant provisions related to HCBS, including the 80/20 or payment adequacy requirement, which will require states to ensure that at least 80 of all Medicaid payments a provider receives for homemaker, home health aide, and personal care services, less certain excluded costs, under specified programs are spent on total compensation (including benefits) for direct care workers furnishing these services, rather than administrative overhead or profit, subject to limited exceptions. States are required to ensure compliance with the 80/20 requirement by mid-2030. The final rule made a number of technical changes to the definitions used in calculating compliance that clarified or narrowed the revenue covered by the calculation and clarified or expanded the payments to workers that are counted in satisfying the requirement, which combined to make compliance less onerous to providers. 
 The final rule includes several other measures intended to promote transparency and enhance quality and access to services, including a variety of reporting requirements for states. Given the very long implementation period and the likelihood of further changes as a result of litigation, administration changes, further rule-making and state changes in response to the final rule, it is premature to predict the ultimate impact of the final rule on our business. 
 Components of our Statements of Income 
 Net Service Revenues 
 We generate net service revenues by providing our services directly to consumers and primarily on an hourly basis in our personal care segment, on a daily basis in our hospice segment and on an episodic basis in our home health segment. We receive payment for providing such services from our private consumers and payors, including federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations and commercial insurers. 
 In our personal care segment, net service revenues are principally provided based on authorized hours, determined by the relevant agency, at an hourly rate, which is either contractual or fixed by legislation, and are recognized at the time services are rendered. In our hospice segment, net service revenues are provided based on daily rates for each of the levels of care and are recognized as services are provided. In our home health segment, net service revenues are based on an episodic basis at a stated rate and recognized based on the number of days elapsed during a period of care within the reporting period. We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record revenues.

Table of Contents 

 Cost of Service Revenues 
 We incur direct care wages, payroll taxes and benefit-related costs in connection with providing our services. We also provide workers compensation and general liability coverage for our employees. Employees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs in certain instances. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses include our costs for operating our network of local agencies and our administrative offices. Our agency expenses consist of costs for supervisory personnel, our community care supervisors and office administrative costs. Personnel costs include wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits. Facility costs include rents, utilities, and postage, telephone and office expenses. Our corporate and support center expenses include costs for accounting, information systems, human resources, billing and collections, contracting, marketing and executive leadership. These expenses consist of compensation, including stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, legal, accounting and other professional fees, travel, general insurance, rents, provision for doubtful accounts and related facility costs. Expenses related to streamlining our operations such as costs related to terminated employees, termination of professional services relationships, other contract termination costs and asset write-offs are also included in general and administrative expenses. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciable assets consist principally of furniture and equipment, network administration and telephone equipment and operating system software. Depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives or, if less and if applicable, their lease terms. We amortize our intangible assets with finite lives, consisting of customer and referral relationships, trade names, trademarks and non-competition agreements, using straight line or accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense is reported when incurred and principally consists of interest and unused credit line fees on the credit facility. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in the states in which we operate. The effective income tax rates were 26.1 and 23.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rates were 26.1 and 23.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between our federal statutory rate of 21 and our effective income tax rates is principally due to the inclusion of state taxes and non-deductible compensation, partially offset by the use of federal employment tax credits.

Net service revenues increased by 7.0 to 289.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 270.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue increased by 13.6 million in our personal care segment, 4.2 million in our hospice segment and 1.3 million in our home health segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in our personal care segment was mainly due to an increase in revenues per billable hour for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in our hospice and home health segments was primarily due to the acquisition of the operations of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023. 
 Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased to 31.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32.0 for the same period in 2023, due to slightly lower margins in our personal care and hospice segments as the result of increases to direct care wages. 
 General and administrative expenses increased to 62.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 60.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the Tennessee Quality Care acquisition that resulted in an increase in administrative employee wages, bonus, taxes and benefit costs of 2.5 million. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased to 21.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 22.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense decreased to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to decreased amounts held under our credit facility for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased 1.3 million due to an increase in cash investment into interest bearing accounts from the Public Offering. 
 All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. The effective income tax rate was 26.1 and 23.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our higher effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to a lower excess tax benefit as well as a lower benefit from the use of federal employment tax credits. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the excess tax benefit and federal employment tax credits were 3.1 and 5.0 , respectively.

Net service revenues increased by 9.6 to 857.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 782.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net service revenue increased by 46.0 million in our personal care segment, by 16.8 million in our hospice segment and by 12.3 million in our home health segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in our personal care segment net service revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues per billable hour, attributable to the rate increases discussed above, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net service revenues in our hospice and home health segments is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the operations of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023. 
 Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, increased to 31.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 31.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in net service revenues and gross profit in our personal care segment and higher margin in our hospice segment due to the acquisition of the operations of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses increased to 187.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 174.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the Tennessee Quality Care acquisitions that resulted in an increase in administrative employee wages, bonus, taxes and benefit costs of 8.4 million and an increase in acquisition-related expense of 2.8 million. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased to 21.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 22.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense decreased to 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to decreased amounts held under our credit facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased 1.8 million due to an increase in cash investment into interest bearing accounts from the Public Offering. 
 All of our income is from domestic sources. We incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate. The effective income tax rate was 26.1 and 23.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our higher effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally due to a lower excess tax benefit as well as a lower benefit from the use of federal employment tax credits. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the excess tax benefit and federal employment tax credits were 3.1 and 5.8 , respectively.

(1) Average billable census is the number of unique clients receiving a billable service during the year and is the total census divided by months in operation during the period. 

(2) Billable hours is the total number of hours served to clients during the period. Average billable hours per census per month is billable hours divided by average billable census. Billable hours per day is total billable hours divided by the number of business days in the period. Revenues per billable hour is revenue, attributed to billable bonus hours, divided by billable hours. 

(3) Same store growth reflects the change in year-over-year revenue for the same store base. We define the same store base to include those stores open for at least 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing stores, while excluding the impact of acquisitions, new store openings and closures and ARPA associated revenue from this calculation. 

Management deems these metrics to be key performance indicators. Management uses these metrics to monitor our performance, both in our existing operations and acquisitions. Many of these metrics serve as the basis of reported revenues and assessment of these provide direct correlation to the results of operations from period to period and facilitate comparison with the results of our peers. Historical trends established in these metrics can be used to evaluate current operating results, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources and assess the quality and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings. We believe they are useful to investors in evaluating and understanding our business but should not be used solely in assessing the Company s performance. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein to fully evaluate and understand the business as a whole. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled performance indicators used by other companies. 
 The personal care segment derives a significant amount of its net service revenues from operations in Illinois, which represented 38.6 and 38.9 of our net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and accounted for 38.5 and 39.2 of our net service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. One payor, the Illinois Department on Aging, accounted for 21.4 and 20.5 of net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and accounted for 21.1 and 21.2 of net service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 54.2 and 50.4 of personal care segment net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 43.3 and 46.4 of personal care segment net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with commercial insurance, private pay and other payors accounting for the remainder of personal care segment net service revenues. Net service revenues from state, local and other governmental programs accounted for 53.0 and 50.4 of net service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Managed care organizations accounted for 44.3 and 46.2 of personal care segment net service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with commercial insurance, private pay and other payors accounting for the remainder of net service revenues.

 Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, decreased to 27.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly attributed to increases in direct care wages, taxes and benefit costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 27.5 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The personal care segment s general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, were 8.1 and 8.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 7.8 and 8.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The hospice segment generates net service revenues by providing care to patients with a life expectancy of six months or less, as well as related services for their families. Hospice offers four levels of care, as defined by Medicare, to meet the varying needs of patients and their families. The four levels of hospice include routine home care, continuous home care, general inpatient care and respite care. Our hospice segment principally provides routine home care and continuous home care services, and with the JourneyCare acquisition, expanded into providing general inpatient care services. In our hospice segment, net service revenues from Medicare accounted for 91.5 and 89.1 of total hospice segment net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 91.1 and 90.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net service revenues from managed care organizations accounted for 3.2 and 3.4 of total hospice segment net service revenues for each the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3.3 and 3.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Hospice net service revenues increased by 4.2 million and 16.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributed to organic growth and the acquisitions of the operations of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023. 
 Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 46.8 and 47.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 47.3 and 46.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was relatively consistent with the prior period, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was mainly attributed to a decrease in direct care wages, taxes and benefit costs as a percentage of net service revenues. 
 The hospice segment s general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, were 24.6 and 24.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.2 and 25.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net service revenues was primarily due to more efficient operations for administrative employees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The home health segment generates net service revenues by providing home health services on a short-term, intermittent or episodic basis to individuals, generally to treat an illness or injury. Net service revenues from Medicare accounted for 70.6 and 72.1 , managed care organizations accounted for 24.7 and 21.9 and other accounted for 4.7 and 6.0 of total home health segment net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net service revenues from Medicare accounted for 69.6 and 73.9 , managed care organizations accounted for 25.6 and 20.8 and other accounted for 4.8 and 5.3 of total home health segment net service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Home health services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid under the Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment System, which uses national, standardized 30-day period payment rates for periods of care. CMS uses the PDGM as the case-mix classification model to place periods of care into payment categories, classifying patients based on clinical characteristics. An outlier adjustment may be paid for periods of care in which costs exceed a specific threshold amount. 
 Home health net service revenues increased by 1.3 million and 12.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total visits increased for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly attributed to the acquisition of Tennessee Quality Care on August 1, 2023. 
 Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, was 36.4 and 36.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 36.2 and 37.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was primarily due to an increase in direct care wages compared to net service revenues. 
 The home health segment s general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs, rent, information technology and office expenses. General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of net service revenues, were 25.5 and 26.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 25.9 and 24.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net service revenues was primarily due to increases in administrative employee wages, taxes and benefit costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash balances of 222.9 million and 64.8 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we had a 600.0 million revolving credit facility and a 125.0 million incremental loan facility, which may be for term loans or an increase to the revolving loan commitments. The maturity of this credit facility, as of September 30, 2024, was July 30, 2026. It was subsequently extended to July 30, 2028. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 0.4 million in cash to fund the Upstate acquisition and repaid 126.4 million under our revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had no revolving loans outstanding on our credit facility and after giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately 8.0 million of outstanding letters of credit and borrowing limits based on an advance multiple of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), we had 511.5 million of capacity and 503.5 million available for borrowing under our credit facility. At December 31, 2023, we had a total of 126.4 million revolving credit loans, with an interest rate of 7.21 , outstanding on our credit facility. 
 Our credit facility requires us to maintain a total net leverage ratio not exceeding 3.75:1.00. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. Although we believe our liquidity position remains strong, we can provide no assurance that we will remain in compliance with the covenants in our Credit Agreement, and in the future, it may prove necessary to seek an amendment with the bank lending group under our credit facility. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 See Note 9 to the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt , and Note 14 to the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Subsequent Events , for additional details of our long-term debt.

 Public Offering 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of an aggregate 1,725,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, including 225,000 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of 108.00 per share (the Public Offering ). The Company received net proceeds of approximately 175.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses of approximately 10.7 million. The Company used approximately 81.4 million from the net proceeds of the Public Offering for the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under its credit facility and may use any remaining net proceeds of the Public Offering for general corporate purposes, including the Company s previously announced planned acquisition of the personal care assets of Gentiva and any future acquisitions or investments. The Public Offering resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of approximately 175.6 million on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2024. 
 Current Macroeconomic Conditions and COVID-19 Relief Funding 
 Economic conditions in the United States continue to be challenging in various respects. For example, the United States economy continues to experience inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates and challenging labor market conditions. Any resulting economic downturn would pose a risk to states revenues, which in turn could affect our reimbursements and collections received for services rendered. Depending on the severity and length of any potential economic downturn as well as the extent of any federal support, states could face significant fiscal challenges and revise their revenue forecasts and adjust their budgets, and sales tax collections and income tax withholdings could be depressed. 
 ARPA Spending Plans 
 The ARPA provides for 350 billion in relief funding for eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to mitigate the fiscal effects of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Additionally, the law provided for a 10 percentage point increase in federal matching funds for Medicaid HCBS from April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022, provided the state satisfied certain conditions. States are permitted to use the state funds equivalent to the additional federal funds through March 31, 2025. States must use the monies attributable to this matching fund increase to supplement, not supplant, their level of state spending for the implementation of activities enhanced under the Medicaid HCBS in effect as of April 1, 2021. 
 
 HCBS spending plans for the additional matching funds vary by state, but common initiatives in which the Company is participating 
 include those aimed at strengthening the provider workforce (e.g., efforts to recruit, retain, and train direct service providers). The Company is required to properly and fully document the use of such funds in reports to the state in which the funds originated. Funds may be subject to recoupment if not expended or if they are expended on non-approved uses. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received additional state funding provided by the ARPA in an aggregate amount of 3.2 million and 15.4 million, respectively. Of the total state funding received by the Company pursuant to the ARPA through September 30, 2024, the Company utilized 2.6 million and 7.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily for caregivers and adding support to recruiting and retention efforts, included as a reduction of cost of service revenues in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of September 30, 2024, the deferred portion of ARPA funding of 13.7 million is included within Government stimulus advances on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Medicare sequester 
 The CARES Act and related laws temporarily lifted the Medicare sequester, which would have otherwise reduced payments to Medicare providers by 2 as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022. The sequestration payment adjustment was phased back in with a 1 reduction beginning April 1, 2022, and returned to 2 on July 1, 2022. These sequestration cuts have been extended through April 2032.

Table of Contents 

 However, the ARPA increased the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggers an additional statutorily mandated sequestration under the PAYGO Act. As a result, an additional Medicare payment reduction of up to 4 was required to take effect in January 2022. However, Congress has delayed implementation of this payment reduction until 2025. We cannot currently determine if, or to what extent, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted by mandated sequestration triggers under the PAYGO Act, or if or when the mandated sequestration will occur. Further, we anticipate that the federal deficit will continue to place pressure on government healthcare programs, and it is possible that future deficit reduction legislation will impose additional Medicare spending reductions. 
 Cash Flows

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our payors and the outflow of cash for payroll and payroll taxes, operating expenses, interest and taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities was 106.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 82.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to the timing of receipts on accounts receivable and the timing of government stimulus funds. The changes in accounts receivable were primarily related to the growth in revenue and a decrease in days sales outstanding DSO during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, as described below. The related receivables due from the Illinois Department on Aging represented 21.7 and 20.5 of the Company s net accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, as discussed below. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of 0.4 million of net cash used for the Upstate acquisition and 4.4 million for property and equipment purchases, which were primarily related to our ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure, offset by 4.6 million in proceeds received as a deposit on the sale of our New York business. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of 112.2 million of net cash used for the Tennessee Quality Care acquisition. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, property and equipment purchases, primarily related to our ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure, were 1.7 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to a 126.4 million payment on the revolver portion of our credit facility, offset by 175.6 million in net proceeds received from the Public Offering, and also included cash received from the exercise of stock options of 3.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to borrowings of 110.0 million on the revolver portion of our credit facility to fund, in part, the Tennessee Quality Care acquisition, partially offset by a 78.5 million payment on the revolver portion of our credit facility. 
 Outstanding Accounts Receivable 
 Gross accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were approximately 100.0 million and 117.8 million, respectively. Outstanding accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, decreased by 18.9 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. Accounts receivable for the Illinois Department on Aging decreased approximately 8.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our collection procedures include review of account aging and direct contact with our payors. We have historically not used collection agencies. An uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance account after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. 
 We calculate our DSO by taking the trade accounts receivable outstanding, net of allowance for credit losses for doubtful accounts, divided by the net service revenues for the last quarter, multiplied by the number of days in that quarter. Our DSOs were 32 days and 39 days at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The DSOs for our largest payor, the Illinois Department on Aging, were 33 days and 50 days at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 ITEM 3. 	 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt. As of September 30, 2024, however, we had no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. We do not currently have any derivative or hedging arrangements, or other known exposures, to changes in interest rates. 
 ITEM 4. 	 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. 	 Legal Proceedings 
 Legal Proceedings 
 As disclosed in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements (Unaudited), which is incorporated herein by reference, from time to time, we are subject to legal and/or administrative proceedings incidental to our business. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of pending legal and/or administrative proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Item 1A. 	 Ri sk Factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed under the caption Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 27, 2024. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 We may fail to complete the acquisition of Gentiva on a timely basis or at all and may not realize the benefits that are anticipated from the Gentiva Acquisition. 
 We have entered into the Gentiva Purchase Agreement to acquire the personal care business of Gentiva, for a purchase price of approximately 350.0 million, payable in full in cash at the closing, subject to customary adjustments for working capital and other items. The Gentiva Acquisition is expected to close upon the completion of regulatory approvals and subject to the satisfaction of other closing conditions. 
 We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate the Gentiva Acquisition as provided for under the Gentiva Purchase Agreement, or, if such acquisition is completed, we cannot predict the timing of such closing. In addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Gentiva Acquisition, and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Gentiva Acquisition is consummated. If we fail to consummate the Gentiva Acquisition or should the completion be significantly delayed, we could fail to realize all or a portion of the intended economic benefits of such acquisition. Any failure to complete the Gentiva Acquisition could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock. 
 The benefits that are expected to result from the Gentiva Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the growth opportunities we anticipate from the Gentiva Acquisition, which is contingent, in part, on successful integration and Gentiva performing in accordance with our expectations. Even a successful integration and meeting performance expectations may not result in the realization of the full benefits we currently expect, nor can we give assurances that these benefits will be achieved when expected or at all. Moreover, we expect to incur expenses in connection with the integration of Gentiva, and as such, the benefits may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses. Further, our due diligence review of Gentiva may not have successfully identified all potential issues. In addition, the integration of Gentiva may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, regulatory risks, and diversion of management s attention. 
 The pendency of the Gentiva Acquisition could cause disruptions and create uncertainty surrounding our business and affect our relationships with our customers and employees. We have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources to complete the Gentiva Acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage existing operations or pursue alternative strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Until the completion of the Gentiva Acquisition, holders of shares of our common stock will be exposed to the risks faced by our existing business without any of the potential benefits from the Gentiva Acquisition. As a result of investor perceptions about the terms, conditions, risks or benefits of the Gentiva Acquisition, the market price of shares of our common stock may decline.

 1) Each plan will expire on the date represented in the table or upon the earlier completion of all transactions contemplated by the arrangement. (2) This column indicates the total number of shares vesting in connection with equity awards, not the number of shares to be sold. The actual number of shares to be sold will be a smaller number based on whatever is required to satisfy payment of applicable withholding taxes under sell-to-cover arrangements. (3) Mr. Allison became CEO of the Company in early 2016 and, in connection with that appointment, received a grant of options with respect to shares on January 21, 2016, of which remain outstanding and unexercised. Those options have a term and are thus forfeited if not exercised by early 2026. Mr. Allison has established this plan in order to effectuate an orderly process for exercising and selling before the date of forfeiture. Each trading arrangement noted above is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense in Rule 10b5-1(c). other director or Section 16 officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements, as such terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, during the quarter ending September 30, 2024 .
