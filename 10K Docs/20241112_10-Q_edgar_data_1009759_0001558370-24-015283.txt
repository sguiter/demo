 million and a working capital deficit of million. The Company incurred a net loss of million during the six months ended September 30, 2024. On September 28, 2023, the Company filed for a prepackaged financial restructuring with its Senior Lender, Goldman Sachs under the U.S. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy laws. The Company emerged from bankruptcy on December 7, 2023 and effected a financial and organizational restructuring. However, given its current cash position, lack of liquidity, limits to accessing capital and debt funding options, and current economic and market risks, there is substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and its ability to meet its financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements as of, and for the period ended September 30, 2024.

The fair value of and per Preferred Unit at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively, below were determined through the use of an option-pricing method OPM that treats the common and preferred units as call options on the enterprise value of the Company with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the preferred units. The OPM incorporated multiple thresholds that represent future change of control sale prices where the payout structure would differ based on the rights and preferences of each share class. The OPM used was the Black-Scholes Merton BSM model to price the call option, which includes the below variables. The enterprise value utilized by the Company in the OPM represents the value agreed upon by the parties involved in the r estructuring as approved by the Bankruptcy Court: Dividend yield Volatility Risk-free interest rate Expected term years years At each reporting period, the Company remeasures the redemption value of the Preferred Units and adjusts the carrying value, if that value exceeds the initial fair value, to equal the maximum redemption value to retained earnings. The i nitial fair value was million. Subsequent remeasurements of fair value have not exceeded the initial fair value; therefore, no adjustments have been made prior to the current period. The remeasurement as of September 30, 2024 resulted in a fair value of million, which does not exceed the initial fair value; therefore, an adjustment to the carrying value was not recorded .

The assets are being amortized over a period through September 2033 using an effective royalty rate. A amortization period is the minimum expected life cycle of the current generation of products. The effective royalty rate is calculated as the prepaid royalty settlement divided by total projected C200 System units over the amortization period. On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a re-forecast of C200 System unit shipments to determine if an adjustment to the effective royalty rate is necessary and accordingly whether an impairment exists.

 . Factors that affect the Company s warranty obligation include product failure rates, anticipated hours of product operations and costs of repair or replacement in correcting product failures. These factors are estimates that may change based on new information that becomes available each period. Similarly, the Company also accrues the estimated costs to address reliability repairs on products no longer in warranty when, in the Company s judgment, and in accordance with a specific plan developed by the Company, it is prudent to provide such repairs. The Company assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjusts to the liability, as necessary. When the Company has sufficient evidence that product changes are altering the historical failure occurrence rates, the impact of such changes is then taken into account in estimating future warranty liabilities.

 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant for the measurement date of March 31, 2024, and covered the period through June 30, 2024. There can be no assurance that the Purchase and the Collateral Agent will waive any future defaults that may occur. If future defaults occur, the Purchaser and the Collateral Agent can exercise their rights and remedies under the Exit Note Purchase Agreement (and other security related documents), including a right to accelerate the maturity of the Company s repayment obligations under the Exit Notes. The Company has the right to cure an event of default for a breach of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant with a prepayment on the Exit Notes up to the amount that is required to achieve the minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant for the quarter. In the event the Company does not cure the breach, the requisite Purchaser may cause the Collateral Agent to enforce any and all liens and security interests created pursuant to the Collateral Documents and may enforce any and all rights and remedies available. The Company believes it is probable the consolidated liquidity and consolidated adjusted EBITDA financial covenants discussed below will be satisfied for all measurement dates in the upcoming 12 months. Accordingly, the Exit New Money Notes, net of discount were reclassified to a non-current liability on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants. On June 28, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the First Amendment to the Exit Note Purchase Agreement. The First Amendment provides for: (i) the amendment of the minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA financial covenant to (a) allow adjustment for costs related to the restatement of, or other adjustments to, the financial statements of the Company for the period beginning on the Closing Date (as defined in the Exit Note Purchase Agreement) and ending at the end of the 2025 Fiscal Year and (b) the minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA financial covenant to be first tested at the quarter ended September 30, 2024, (ii) the amendment of the minimum consolidated liquidity financial covenant to (a) reduce the minimum consolidated liquidity to from September 30, 2024 to March 30, 2025 and (b) defer the testing of the minimum consolidated liquidity financial covenant to September 30, 2024 and (iii) the extension of the deadline for the delivery of the Company s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (the fiscal 2024 financial statements to September 27, 2024 and the removal of the covenant that the fiscal 2024 financial statements be accompanied by a report and opinion of an independent certified public accountant which is not subject to any going concern or like qualification. The minimum consolidated liquidity covenant will be tested at all times from and after September 30, 2024, and requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a minimum average Consolidated Liquidity (as defined in the First Amendment) during any consecutive day period of no less than: (i) from September 30, 2024 to March 30, 2025, ; (ii) from March 31, 2025 to June 29, 2025, ; (iii) from June 30, 2025 to September 29, 2025, ; (iv) from September 30, 2025 to March 30, 2026, ; and (v) from March 31, 2026 to December 7, 2026, .

 FPP contract period with automatic renewals for , , , or under ASC 606. The related costs are accrued at the time a customer submits an order, and the order s compliance with the terms of the plan are confirmed, for a replacement part to reflect the Company s obligation. The accrual reflects the Company s best estimate of the probable liability under the replacement part obligation. The provision is periodically adjusted to reflect actual experience. FPP contracts typically go into effect once the standard warranty expires. Comprehensive factory protection plan service contracts require payment at the beginning of the contract period. Advance payments are not considered a significant financing component as they are typically received less than one year before the related performance obligations are satisfied. These payments are treated as a contract liability and are classified in deferred revenue in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once control transfers to the customer and the Company meets the revenue recognition criteria, the deferred revenue is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The deferred revenue relating to the annual maintenance service contracts is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the contract. Some FPPs offer labor reimbursement on the labor performed on a microturbine system. Due to the nature of the arrangement, labor reimbursements are accounted for under ASC 460. An Authorized Service Provider (ASP) must perform the labor. ASPs submit claims for labor reimbursements and are credited for the cost of labor if the repairs meet the Company s prescribed standards. The Company is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under these arrangements because the FPPs do not contain a limit on the number of labor reimbursements that may be submitted. However, given historical practice, the Company has priced the FPP to cover all costs incurred related to the labor reimbursement and is not exposed to significant losses over the FPP premium. The labor reimbursement is separate and distinct from the parts offering; therefore, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to the labor reimbursement based on SSP. The Company applies judgment in determining the SSP as the labor reimbursement is not sold separately. The Company will recognize a liability at the inception of the executed FPP agreement for the premium received in advance for the Labor offering. Income will be recognized on a net, straight-line basis with labor reimbursement costs recognized when incurred. Significant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations The Company enters into contracts with its customers that often include promises to transfer multiple products, parts, accessories, FPP and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment. Products, parts and accessories are distinct as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether FPP and service contracts are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each FPP and services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the services, the timing of when the services contract was signed in comparison to the product delivery date and the contractual dependence of the product on the customer s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the FPP and services contracts included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where systems and services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. The determination of SSP is made through approval by the Company s management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Company s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP. In certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices.

Other Commitments The Company has agreements with certain of its distributors requiring that, if the Company renders parts obsolete in inventories the distributors own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, then the Company is required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors. While the Company has never incurred costs or obligations for these types of replacements, it is possible that future changes in the Company s product technology could result in and yield costs to the Company if significant amounts of inventory are held at distributors. As of September 30, 2024, no significant inventories of this nature were held at distributors. Legal Matters Capstone Turbine Corporation v. Turbine International, LLC On February 3, 2020, Capstone Turbine Corporation filed suit against its former distributor, Turbine International, LLC Turbine Intl. ), in the Superior Court of California alleging breach of contract relating to the parties prior distributor relationship (which terminated at the end of March 2018) and Turbine Intl. s failure to satisfy its payment obligations under certain financial agreements; namely an accounts receivable agreement and promissory note in favor of Capstone. The Company is seeking approximately M in compensatory damages, along with injunctive relief and attorney s fees, interest, and costs. A trial date has been set for December 2, 2024. In 2020, the parties made a number of court filings, including answers, cross-claims, and a First Amended Complaint. Turbine Intl. s filings were against Capstone, and individually against Mr. James Crouse, Capstone s Former Chief Revenue Officer. Capstone s subsequent filings were against Turbine Intl., as well as its guarantors, including a related entity Hispania Petroleum SA Hispania and the principals of both entities. Currently, the defendants are without counsel. As legal entities cannot appear without counsel, the Court issued a default judgment against Turbine Intl. and struck its counterclaim. As part of the Reorganization, the Company became the party to the litigation. The Company has not recorded a liability as of September 30, 2024, as the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss. SEC Investigation In June 2023, prior to the issuance of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Audit Committee of the Company s Board commenced an Investigation into certain accounting and internal control matters of the Company, principally focused on certain revenue recognition matters (the Revenue Recognition Investigation ), and self-reported its findings to the Division of Enforcement of the SEC. Following the self-report, the SEC Enforcement Division commenced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the restatement of the Company s quarterly and annual financial statements (the SEC Investigation ). The Audit Committee further self-reported its findings pursuant to an investigation into FPP related practices to the SEC. The Company is cooperating with

 million in damages and alleging that the Company breached the Distributor Agreement between the parties and committed fraud in allowing another company, Capstone Engineered Solutions, to sell, rent and service turbines in Cal Microturbine s exclusive territory under the Distribution Agreement. On August 18, 2024, Cal Microturbine amended its complaint and reduced its damage claims to million. On September 9, 2024, the Company filed a counterclaim against Cal Microturbine for million, alleging various violations of the Distributor Agreement. On September 27, 2024, Cal Microturbine provided the second amendment to its complaint to increase its claims and damages to million. The parties have completed selection of a three person arbitration panel which has provided a hearing date in June 2025, with a backup date in September 2025. The parties are pursuing mediation to potentially accelerate the conclusion of this matter. Discovery is also scheduled to being in November 2024. The Company has not recorded a liability as of September 30, 2024, as it is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss. Spitzer v. Flexon, Jamison, Juric, Robinson, and Hencken On October 13, 2023, a putative securities class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Spitzer v. Flexon, et al., Case No. 2:23-cv-08659, naming certain of the Company s current and former directors and officers as defendants. The suit alleges various claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 based on allegedly false and misleading statements and allegedly inadequate disclosure regarding the Company s business, operations and prospects and the circumstances leading up to the restatement of the Company s quarterly and annual financial statements. The suit is purportedly brought on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s securities between June 14, 2021 and September 22, 2023, and seeks to recover unspecified compensatory damages and other relief, including attorney s fees. The Company is not a named respondent in this matter and has not engaged legal counsel. In August 2024, Petitioners made an unprompted settlement demand. The action has been stayed since September 6, 2024 to allow the parties to explore settlement, the outcome of which such cannot be assured or reasonably estimated. The Company may incur significant legal expenses in defending the matters described above and in connection with any other potential legal matters, including expenses for the potential reimbursement of legal fees of officers and directors under Company indemnification obligations. At this point, the Company anticipates that such legal fees will not exceed the insurance deductible of million as the defendants legal costs are covered under the Company s D O insurance coverage. The Company has not recorded a liability as of September 30, 2024, as a loss that could exceed the D O coverage is not expected. The Company incurred legal fees against the insurance deductible of million as of September 30, 2024. Mark Estrada and Ricardo Montalvo, vs. Capstone Green Energy LLC and Erick Kim In August 2024, two filings were made by the Bibiyan Law Group against Capstone and an individual supervisory employee at Capstone (in order to retain state court jurisdiction) on behalf of current and former non-exempt California Capstone employees. Both filings allege various pay violations including failure to pay overtime wages, failure to provide meal periods and breaks, and failure to issue accurate pay statements. The first filing, which was made with the Superior Court of the State of California, requests that the Court certify the non-exempt employees as a Class. The Court has not ruled on that request. Capstone, in consultation with its legal counsel, believes that the arbitration agreements that it has in place with such current and former employees, which agreements include a class action waiver, is enforceable and will move to compel arbitration. The second filing was made with the Labor Development Workforce Agency Agency ). The that the Agency had to accept the claim expired last week. Accordingly, plaintiffs are now able to pursue the claim privately under the Private Attorney General Act PAGA ). However, the recent PAGA reform creates uncertainty in two areas; First, under the reform statute, a defendant can now cap its potential penalties if it conducts an audit into the alleged violations and proposes remedial action. Capstone did conduct such an audit but was unable to find any violations based on its review of the plaintiffs letter, its pay records, and its existing policies and procedures. However, Capstone

 of any such recovery. Notwithstanding, law firms pursue PAGA because courts have ruled that mandatory arbitration provisions are not effective against the Agency. The Company has not recorded a liability as of September 30, 2024, as the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss. The Company intends to fight the claims vigorously. DV Energy, LLC vs Capstone Green Energy Holdings, Inc, Capstone Turbine Corporation, Capstone Green Energy Corporation, and Capstone Green Energy, LLC. On August 26, 2024, DV Energy, LLC DV Energy ), a Capstone distributor in Russia, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles to recover a million parts deposit, along with interest and legal fees. DV Energy is claiming breach of contract, restitution, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, account stated, money had and received, open book account, unfair business practices, accounting, and conversion. The complaint relates to a deposit for a product order that Capstone was restricted from delivering due to changes in U.S. sanctions laws following Russia s invasion of Ukraine. Capstone is disputing DV Energy s claim on the basis that the distributor agreement clearly states that deposits are non-refundable and the Company intends to fill the order when U.S. Sanctions permits. The Company s Distributor Agreement defines deposits as non-refundable. The value of the DV Energy deposit is recorded in the Company s financial statements as a current liability as of September 30, 2024. with an , which may impact the lease term. Monthly rental payments are fixed; however, the leases may include variable payments for fuel, excess labor, additional equipment, or technician labor and engineering support. As further described below, the Company rents certain microturbine equipment back from customers and subleases this equipment to end users as a part of its Energy-as-a-Service business. (remainder of fiscal year) 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total minimum rental revenue Lessee The Company leases facilities and equipment under various non-cancelable operating and finance leases expiring at various times through Fiscal 2037. All of the leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and property taxes. The lease agreements for primary office and manufacturing facilities provide for rent escalation over the lease term and for periods. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which may include extension periods. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not enter into any rental agreements to rent used microturbine equipment from customers where that equipment was not currently in use. The existing rental agreements provide the Company an option to extend the lease, however, the Company is not likely to exercise these options and therefore not included in the determination of the lease term.

Overview We are the market leader in microturbine energy systems based on the number of microturbines sold annually and total installed base. Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies in simple cycle mode. Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids. However, when considering and including the waste heat from our microturbine (CHP and CCHP) the economic benefit improves significantly. Further, our highly efficient, low emission, resilient technology can produce thermal energy at a lower carbon footprint. These benefits can be especially realized when fuel costs are low, where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications or new grid services need to be provided), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices. Our microturbines are an inverter-based technology and can be interconnected to other distributed energy resources to form microgrids (also called distribution networks located within a specific geographic area and provide power to a group of buildings. Because our microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they help solve the Energy Trilemma of resiliency, sustainability and affordability. Management also believes our products and services offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines. We are currently exploring energy conversion options for the smaller end of the power spectrum. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss decreased by 5.5 million, or 93 , to 0.4 million and our basic and diluted loss per share decreased by 93 to (0.02), compared to a 5.9 million net loss and (0.32) net loss per share during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease to net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the 1.7 million improvement in gross profit, lower operating expenses of 2.8 million, lower interest expense of 0.8 million and an increase in other income, net of 0.6 million, partially offset by reorganization items, net of 0.5 million. In the energy efficiency market, we continue to expand our market presence in hotels, office buildings, hospitals, retail, and industrial applications globally. The renewable energy market is fueled by landfill gas, biodiesel, and biogas from sources such as food processing, agricultural waste and livestock manure. Our product sales in the oil and gas and other natural resources market is driven by our microturbines reliability, emissions profile and ease of installation. Given the volatility of the oil and gas market, our business strategy is to ensure diversification by also targeting projects within the energy efficiency and renewable energy markets. We continue to focus on improving our products based on customer input, building brand awareness and new channels to market by developing a diversified network of strategic distribution partners. Our focus is on products and solutions that provide near term opportunities to drive repeatable business rather than discrete projects for niche markets. In addition, management closely monitors operating expenses and strives to improve manufacturing efficiencies while simultaneously lowering direct material costs and increasing average selling prices. The key drivers to our success 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 are revenue growth, higher average selling prices, lower direct material costs, positive new order flow, reduced cash usage and expansion of the Energy-as-a-Service EaaS business. An overview of our direction, targets and key initiatives are as follows: 1. Our Energy Conversion Products business line is driven by our industry-leading, highly efficient, low-emission, resilient microturbine energy systems offering scalable solutions in addition to a broad range of customer-tailored solutions. We target specific market verticals for these products. 
 Focus on Vertical Markets Within the distributed generation markets that we serve, we focus on vertical markets that we identify as having the greatest near-term potential. In our primary products and applications (energy efficiency, natural resources, renewable energy, critical power supply, microgrid and transportation products), we identify specific targeted vertical market segments. Within each of these segments, we identify what we believe to be the critical factors to success and base our plans on those factors. Given the volatility of the oil and gas market, we have refocused our business strategy to principally target projects within the energy efficiency and renewable energy markets. The following table summarizes our percentage or product revenues by vertical markets for which we had product revenues for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Energy efficiency 59 40 51 43 Natural resources 36 51 36 48 Renewable energy 5 9 13 9 Energy Efficiency CHP/CCHP Energy efficiency refers to the proper utilization of both electrical and thermal energies in the power production process. In such applications, our microturbines are able to maximize the availability of usable energy to provide a significant economic advantage to our customers while reducing their on-site emissions. CHP and CCHP can improve site economics by capturing the waste heat created from a single combustion process to increase the efficiency of the total system, from approximately 30 to approximately 85 for hot water and chilled water to as much as 90 or more for some steam and direct drying applications. Compared with more traditional, independent generation sources, the increase in operational efficiency also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through the displacement of other separate systems, which can also reduce operating costs and industrial waste. Natural Resources Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Shale Gas Mining Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market for use in both onshore and offshore applications, including oil and gas exploration, production, and at compression and transmission sites as a highly efficient and reliable source of power. In some cases, these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on power generated on-site. There are numerous locations, on a global scale, where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which are traditionally burned or released into the atmosphere. Our microturbines can turn these fuel byproducts, such as flare gas, or associated gas, into useable fuel to provide prime power to these sites. Renewable Energy There is a growing transition to renewable energy sources and technologies on a global scale. Our microturbines run efficiently on renewable fuels such as methane and other biogases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and renewable natural gas. They also run efficiently on other small biogas applications like food processing plants, livestock farms and agricultural green waste operations. Microturbines can burn these renewable fuels with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this free renewable fuel source for use at the site or in the surrounding areas. Our microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these smaller applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur, as the sulfur can contaminate combustion engines lube oil, leading to equipment breakdowns and higher lifecycle costs.

 Microgrid Microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that acts as a single controllable energy entity with respect to the grid. Distributed energy resources typically include other dual-mode microturbines, reciprocating engines, solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines, fuel cells and battery storage. Microgrids can be connected to larger electricity grids; however, in the event of a widespread outage, the microgrid will disconnect from the main grid and continue to operate independently to maintain the electricity supply to the homes and businesses that are connected to the microgrid s electricity network. Our microturbines have the ability to meet the needs of microgrid end-users by lowering their overall cost to operate and by providing versatile dispatchable technology that is fuel flexible and scalable enough to fit a wide variety of applications. Transportation Our technology can also be used to support Electric Vehicle EV market by providing power solutions to charge vehicles. Our products can fill a void in the EV market for vehicle charging capacity and charging convenience. Our customers have applied our products in EV applications for fleets and remote location charging stations. We are continuing to pursue global EV charging opportunities to fill the demand for power in this market segment. Backlog Net product orders were approximately 9.2 million and 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Ending backlog was approximately 10.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 14.2 million at March 31, 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.8:1 and 0.4:1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of new orders we received to units shipped and billed during a period. A portion of our backlog is concentrated in the oil and gas market, which may impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue. The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers. However, based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months. Additionally, the timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue. As a result, management believes the book-to-bill ratio demonstrates the current demand for our products in the given period. 2. Sales and Distribution Channels We seek out distributors that have business experience and capabilities to support our growth plans in our targeted markets. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to distributors that resell our products to end users. We have a total of 54 distributors, Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs and national accounts. In the United States and Canada, we currently have 8 distributors, OEMs and national accounts. Outside of the United States and Canada, we currently have 46 distributors, OEMs and national accounts. We continue to refine our distribution channels to address our specific targeted markets. 3. Service As part of our EaaS business line, we provide service primarily through our global distribution network. Together with our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive factory protection plan for a fixed fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed. We provide factory and on-site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines. Factory protection plans FPPs are generally paid quarterly in advance. We offer new and remanufactured parts through our global distribution network. Service revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 23 and 19 of total revenue, respectively. Service revenue during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 25 and 20 of total revenue, respectively. 4. Product Robustness and Life Cycle Maintenance Costs We continue to invest in enhancements that relate to high performance and high reliability. An important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is 

 27 

Table of Contents 
 to focus on the engineering of our product hardware and electronics to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved microturbine performance, reliability and low maintenance costs to our customers. 5. New Product Development Our new product development is targeted specifically to meet the needs of our selected vertical markets. We expect that our existing product platforms, the C65, C200, C600, C800 and C1000S Series microturbines, will be our foundational product lines for the foreseeable future. Our research and development project portfolio is centered on enhancing the features of these base products. 
 We have continued to develop our new hydrogen products. In March 2022, we released a commercially available hydrogen-based combined heat and power product, which can safely run on a 30 hydrogen-70 natural gas mix. In continuing these efforts, we are testing a 100 hydrogen gas combustion system through our research and development partnership with Argonne National Laboratory. 6. Cost and Core Competencies We believe that the core competencies of our products are our recuperator design, air-bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra-low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems. Our core intellectual property is contained within our air-bearing technology. We continue to review avenues for cost reduction by sourcing from the best value supply chain option. In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, we are focused on continuous improvements in manufacturing processes. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement, product design, advanced manufacturing technology, supply management and logistics. Management expects to be able to leverage our costs as product volumes increase. 
 Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high- volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years. Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications and require longer lead times. We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time; however, it may be more challenging to transition to another supplier from single source suppliers with long lead times. We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our future needs. We believe that effective execution in each of these key areas will be necessary to leverage our promising technology and early market leadership into achieving positive cash flow with growing market presence and improving financial performance. We currently occupy warehouse and office space in Van Nuys, California with a production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to those related to inventories, credit losses and redeemable noncontrolling interests valuations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 describe the significant accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our revenue by geographic markets (in millions): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 United States and Canada 15.9 17.4 Europe 1.5 4.4 Latin America 4.4 4.9 Asia and Australia 0.6 1.4 Middle East and Africa 0.3 0.3 Total Revenue 22.7 28.4 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 5.7 million to 22.7 million from 28.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 5.7 million decrease was primarily driven by decreases in revenue of 2.9 million in Europe, 1.5 million in the United States and Canada, 0.8 million in Asia and Australia and 0.5 million in Latin America. The decreases in Europe, United States and Canada, Asia and Australia and Latin America were primarily due to decreases in product deliveries for projects in those regions during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Parts and services revenue was impacted by order timing and parts availability. The following table summarizes our revenue (revenue amounts in millions): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Revenue Megawatts Units Revenue Megawatts Units Microturbine Product 10.9 6.8 29 14.5 12.2 63 Accessories 0.4 0.6 Total Product and Accessories 11.3 15.1 Parts and services 7.9 9.7 Rentals 3.5 3.6 Total Revenue 22.7 28.4 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from microturbine products and accessories decreased 3.8 million, or 25 , to 11.3 million from 15.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 3.8 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in 5.4 megawatts shipped from 12.2 to 6.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Product demand was adversely affected by the restructuring as customers assessed the long-term viability of the Company. Average revenue per megawatt shipped was approximately 1.6 million and 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was the result of previously announced product price increases. The timing of shipments is variable and based on several factors (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and delivery schedule changes), most of which are not within our control and can affect the timing of revenue recognition. Parts, service and rentals revenue (which are part of our EaaS business line and includes revenue from our parts shipments, factory protection plan FPP contracts, rentals, Distributor Support Subscription DSS fees and other service revenue) decreased 1.9 million, or 14 , to 11.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.9 million decrease was primarily due to decreases in our spare parts revenue of 1.3 million and 0.6 million in DSS fees as, following the Reorganization, the DSS service fees are reported as Other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies Related Party Transactions, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the DSS fees in connection with the Reorganization during Fiscal 2024. Sales to E -Finity Distributed Generation E-Finity ), Arctic Energy Inc. Arctic and Lone Star Power Solutions, LLC Lone Star , three of our domestic distributors, and GET/CWS Limited, one of our international customers, accounted for 21 , 14 , 10 and 11 of revenue for the three months ended September 30,

 2024, respectively. Sales to E-Finity and Cal Microturbine accounted for 21 and 11 of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Gross Profit Cost of goods sold includes direct material costs, production and service center labor and overhead, inventory charges and provision for estimated product warranty expenses. Gross profit was 7.0 million, or 31 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gross profit of 5.3 million, or 19 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in product pricing, resulting in an increase of average revenue per megawatt shipped, lower warranty charges and decreases in production and service center labor and overhead expenses. Effective March 2024, we increased our sales prices and are negotiating with vendors to reduce material costs. The following table summarizes our gross profit (in millions except percentages): 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Gross Profit Product and accessories 0.7 (0.2) As a percentage of product and accessories revenue 6 (1) Parts, services and rentals 6.3 5.5 As a percentage of parts, services and rentals revenue 55 41 Total gross profit 7.0 5.3 As a percentage of total revenue 31 19 The improvement of 0.9 million in product and accessories gross profit was primarily due to higher product pricing and changes in product mix during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Product and accessories gross margin as a percentage of product and accessories revenue increased to 6 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from (1) during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher product pricing in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Parts, services and rentals gross margin as a percentage of parts and service revenue increased to 55 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 41 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in parts prices and lower overhead costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Research and Development R D Expenses R D expenses were 0.6 million and 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, General, and Administrative SG A Expenses SG A expenses decreased 2.8 million, or 30 , to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to unusually high legal fees incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 for reorganization and restatement activities, resulting in a decrease of 3.3 million and lower marketing expenses of 0.4 million, partially offset by an increase of 0.9 million in accounting expenses. Interest Expense Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.0 million and 1.8 million, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower average debt balance during the second quarter of Fiscal 2025 due to our Reorganization, compared to 51.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under the pre-petition notes during Fiscal 2024.

The 13.9 million decrease was primarily driven by decreases in revenue of 6.3 million in Europe, 4.6 million in the United States and Canada, 2.3 million in Asia and Australia and 0.9 million in Latin America, partially offset by an increase of 0.2 million in the Middle East and Africa. The decreases in Europe, the United States and Canada, Asia and Australia and Latin America were primarily due to decreases in product deliveries for projects in those regions during the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the Middle East and Africa was primarily due to an increase in our revenue from our parts shipments to the region, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023.

The 11.7 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of 13.4 in megawatts shipped of 10.8 from 24.2 during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. Product demand was adversely affected by the restructuring as customers assess the long-term viability of the Company.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Our cash requirements depend on many factors, including the execution of our business strategy and plan. Our cash increased 0.6 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by cash used in investing and financing activities. Operating Activities During the six months ended September 30, 2024, 0.9 million in cash was provided by our operating activities, which consisted of a net loss for the period of 4.4 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1.5 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments (primarily representing depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expenses and paid-in-kind PIK interest) of 6.7 million. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we used 9.4 million in cash for our operating activities, which consisted of a net loss for the period of 11.6 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.0 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments (primarily representing depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, non-cash reorganization items, net, stock-based compensation, inventory and warranty provision) of 4.2 million. The following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (in thousands): 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net loss (4,360) (11,566) Non-cash operating activities(1) 6,731 4,222 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (2,870) (1,942) Inventories 2,831 7,656 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 2,896 2,329 Operating lease liability, net (1,973) (1,551) Prepaid expenses, other current assets and other assets 1,452 168 Factory protection plan liability (1,693) (133) Other changes in operating assets and liabilities (2,116) (8,536) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 898 (9,353) 
 (1) Represents changes in depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expenses, PIK interest, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash reorganization items, net, and inventory, warranty and credit loss provisions. 
 The change in non-cash operating activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in PIK interest of 1.7 million related to the issuance of the Exit Notes during Fiscal 2024 and a decrease in non-cash reorganization expenses of 0.5 million that was not incurred during the six months ended September 30, 2024. The 2.8 million of cash provided from inventory during the six months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of improved supply chain management and reduced lead times for parts, compared to the 7.7 million of cash provided from inventory during the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the reduction in finished goods inventory levels. The change in accounts receivable was primarily the result of delayed collections during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in payments to vendors during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The change in other operating assets and liabilities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the decreases in deferred revenue attributable to customer deposits and the removal of the DSS service fees. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of 0.2 million and 3.9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was primarily due to investments in operating and rental fleet assets, respectively. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was used for repayment of finance lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of net cash of 3.0 million received from the issuance of additional pre-petition senior secured notes.

Lease Commitments Refer to Note 14 Leases in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to our leases. Going Concern In connection with preparing the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended September 30, 2024, management evaluated whether there were conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raised substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they became due for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of our financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2.7 million, and a working capital deficit of 7.8 million. We incurred a net loss of 4.4 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024. On September 28, 2023, we filed for a prepackaged financial restructuring with our Senior Lender, Goldman Sachs under the U.S. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy laws. We emerged from bankruptcy on December 7, 2023 and effected a financial and organizational restructuring. However, given our current cash position, lack of liquidity, limits to accessing capital and debt funding options, and current economic and market risks, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern and our ability to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements as of, and for the period ended September 30, 2024. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 3 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding new accounting standards. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Material Weakness Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual and interim financial statements will not be detected or prevented on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses were identified: There was an inappropriate tone at the top established by certain former senior executives. For example, certain former senior executives delayed shipments of parts under the FPP service contracts, which because of our incorrect accounting for our FPP program resulted in delayed recording of the associated expense and liabilities on the Company s financial statements. These business practices were also not properly communicated to our Board, Audit Committee, or independent registered public accounting firm. We lacked sufficient qualified professionals with an appropriate level of accounting and internal control knowledge, training and experience to (i) appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately and (ii) design and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. We did not perform a sufficient review of accounting policies to ensure ongoing adherence with U.S. GAAP. We did not design and maintain effective controls over financial reporting for systems, products, parts, and accessories sales subject to bill and hold arrangements with customers. We did not design and maintain effective controls over financial reporting related to the proper accounting, presentation and disclosure for FPP service contracts, including the cost recognition of parts and labor associated with FPP service contracts. 
 Management s Remediation Plan Management, with the direction and oversight of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, is engaged in remediation actions to address the material weaknesses described above. The Company s remediation actions include, but are not limited to the following: The Company has reinforced and will continue to reinforce its tone at the top through enhanced communication of the Company s values and expected business conduct to their personnel directly from the Company s senior leadership. Management is enhancing our quarterly disclosure committee meetings to require additional communication of business activities to the appropriate finance and accounting personnel and to our Board and Audit Committee as required. The Company has hired and continues to hire additional accounting and compliance personnel as is necessary to maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Management will continue to assess the composition of its resource needs, both internal and external, which may include hiring additional accounting and compliance resources, including engaging in third-party advisors when necessary. Management is implementing a formal process to periodically review and update accounting policies. Management has reviewed and refined the Company s current accounting memorandums related to product, parts, and accessories sales and FPP service contracts to address the proper financial reporting considerations. Additionally, management is enhancing the design of and implementing controls over financial reporting for (i) systems, products, parts, and accessories sales subject to bill and hold arrangements with customers and (ii) FPP service contracts, including the cost recognition of parts and labor associated with FPP service contracts. 
 We believe these measures will remediate the material weaknesses, but management is assessing the need for any additional steps to remediate the underlying causes that gave rise to these weaknesses. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. There is no assurance that additional remediation steps will not be necessary. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules

 13d-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. PART II OTHER INFORMATIO N Item 1. Legal Proceeding s Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved. The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company and certain of its former and current directors and officers are a party to several material legal proceedings. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were to be resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations, the Company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factor s In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, together with the cautionary statement under the caption Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The risks described are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Item 5. Other Information Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of or any .
