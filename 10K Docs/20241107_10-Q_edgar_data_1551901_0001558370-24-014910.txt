 Revenue Recognition We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent such interest is deemed collectible. Payment-in-kind PIK interest represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity. We will not accrue any form of interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we then accrete or amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fee is recorded as interest

 To maintain our treatment as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid to stockholders in the form of distributions, even if we have not collected any cash. Management considers portfolio company specific circumstances as well as other economic factors in determining collectability of interest income. As of September 30, 2024, we had loans to portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately of our loan portfolio at cost and at fair value.

Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of and , respectively, was mostly related to excise and franchise taxes. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken while preparing its tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the applicable period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had not recorded a liability for any unrecognized tax positions. Management s evaluation of uncertain tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income taxes, if applicable, in general and administrative expenses. Any expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were de minimis. The Taxable Subsidiaries are direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company that have elected to be taxable entities. The Taxable Subsidiaries permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies that are pass through entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the source-of-income requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Taxable Subsidiaries use the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. Taxable income generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded deferred income tax benefit of and , respectively, related to the Taxable Subsidiaries.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an expense for base management fees of and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an expense for base management fees of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and of such management fess, respectively, were payable to Stellus Capital. The incentive fee has two components, the investment income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee, as follows: Investment Income Incentive Fee The investment income component Income Incentive Fee is calculated, and payable to the Advisor, quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a cumulative total return requirement and to deferral of non-cash amounts. The pre-incentive fee net investment income, which is expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets attributable to the Company s common stock, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, will have a (which is annualized) hurdle rate (also referred to as the Hurdle ). Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Advisor receives incentive fee for any calendar quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle. Subject to the cumulative total return requirement described below, the Advisor receives of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the pre-incentive net investment income for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle but is less than (which is annualized) of net assets (also referred to as the Catch-up and of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter, if any, greater than annualized) of net assets. The foregoing Income Incentive Fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income is payable except to the extent of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any Income Incentive Fee that is payable in a calendar quarter is limited to the lesser of (i) of the amount by which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the hurdle, subject to the Catch-up, and (ii) (x) of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters. For the foregoing purpose, the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the amount, if positive, of the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the Advisor is not paid the portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest until the Company actually receives such interest in cash. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred and of Income Incentive Fees, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred and of Income Incentive Fees, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, of such Income

 and , respectively, were currently payable (as explained below). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, of Income Incentive Fees incurred but not paid by the Company were generated from deferred interest (i.e. PIK, certain discount accretion and deferred interest) and are not payable until such amounts are received by the Company in cash. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and of Income Incentive Fees accrued but not paid by the Company were permanently written off due to the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return limitation. Capital Gains Incentive Fee The Company also pays the Advisor an incentive fee based on capital gains (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee ). The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement, as of the termination date). The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is equal to of the Company s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from Inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and cumulative aggregate unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year. The aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gain Incentive Fees is subtracted from such Capital Gain Incentive Fees calculated. U.S. GAAP requires that the Capital Gains Incentive Fee accrual considers the cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation of investments and other financial instruments in the calculation, as an incentive fee would be payable if such realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation were realized, even though such realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the Capital Gains Incentive Fee actually payable under the investment advisory agreement. There can be no assurance that unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly, such fees, as calculated and accrued, may not necessarily be payable under the investment advisory agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of incentive fees in subsequent periods. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t incur any Capital Gains Incentive Fee. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did t incur any Capital Gains Incentive Fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reversed related to the Capital Gains Incentive Fee. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Capital Gains Incentive Fees were accrued. The following tables summarize the components of the incentive fees discussed above: Capital gains incentive fees reversed ) Income incentive fee waiver ) Incentive fees expense

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 38.6 million and 26.1 million, respectively. Investment Activity During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made an aggregate of 112.6 million of investments in 12 new portfolio companies and 18 existing portfolio companies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received an aggregate of 87.3 million in proceeds from repayments of our investments.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made an aggregate of 139.7 million of investments in 17 new portfolio companies and 18 existing portfolio companies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received an aggregate of 79.1 million in proceeds from repayments of our investments. Our level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Asset Quality In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Stellus Capital uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category: Investment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. Investment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2. Investment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants. Investment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected. Investment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.

 Loans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status We will not accrue interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. As of September 30, 2024, we had loans to six portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 6.9 of our loan portfolio at cost and 4.7 at fair value. As of December 31, 2023, we had loans to four portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 4.2 of our loan portfolio at cost and 1.3 at fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 5.1 million and 7.5 million of income from investments on non-accrual had not been accrued, respectively.

 Results of Operations An important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses, including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Revenues We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest primarily at floating rates. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind, or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees. The following shows the breakdown of investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions).

 (1) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.4 million and 1.8 million, respectively, of non-recurring income related to early repayments and amendments to specific loan positions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 0.7 million and 1.4 million, respectively, of non-recurring income related to early repayments and amendments to specific loan positions. 
 The decrease in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in our principal debt outstanding. The increase in investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to growth in the overall investment portfolio. Expenses Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to Stellus Capital under the investment advisory agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, which may include: organization and offering costs; valuing our assets and calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);

For the three months ended For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Operating Expenses Management fees 3.9 3.9 11.7 11.5 Valuation fees 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Administrative services expenses 0.5 0.5 1.5 1.4 Income incentive fees 2.6 2.7 7.6 7.4 Capital gains incentive fee reversal (0.6) Professional fees 0.3 0.3 0.8 0.9 Directors fees 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Insurance expense 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.4 Interest expense and other fees 8.0 8.0 23.9 24.0 Income tax expense 0.4 0.3 1.3 1.1 Other general and administrative expenses 0.2 0.2 0.9 0.8 Total Operating Expenses 16.2 16.3 48.7 47.5 Income incentive fee waiver (1.9) Total Operating Expenses, net of fee waivers 16.2 16.3 46.8 47.5 The decrease in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the income incentive fee waiver, offset by the capital gains incentive fee reversal . Net Investment Income For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 10.3 million, or 0.39 per common share (based on 26,326,426 weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net investment income was 10.8 million, or 0.47 per common share (based on 22,824,221 weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2023). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net investment income was 32.3 million, or 1.29 per common share (based on 25,066,626 weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net investment income was 30.3 million, or 1.42 per common share (based on 21,289,880 weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). The decrease in net investment income over the respective three month periods was due to lower non-recurring investment income and higher non-accrual investments. The increase in net investment income over the respective nine month periods was due to higher investment income as a result of a larger investment portfolio, offset by the decrease in expenses as explained in the Expenses section above. Net Realized Gains and Losses We measure net realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment, sale or other disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 15.5 million and net realized losses totaled 3.3) million.

Table of Contents 
 Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 34.8 million and net realized gains totaled 0.6 million. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 87.3 million and net realized losses totaled 21.7) million. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 79.1 million and net realized losses totaled 0.3) million. Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and cash equivalents for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 8.5 million and 13.8) million, respectively. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 26.4 million and 24.3) million, respectively. The change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) over the respective periods was due to reversals of previous write-downs that were realized and company-specific investment write-downs, offset by company-specific write-ups. Benefit (Provision) for Taxes on Unrealized Investments We have direct wholly owned subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities (the Taxable Subsidiaries ). The Taxable Subsidiaries permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies, which are pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and continue to comply with the source income requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with us for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate U.S. federal income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The U.S. federal income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a benefit (provision) for income tax on unrealized investments of 0.2 million and 0.1) million for the Taxable Subsidiaries, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 0.0 million and 0.2 million of deferred tax liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, respectively. Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled 15.5 million, or 0.59 per common share (based on 26,326,426 weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2024). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net decrease in net assets resulting from operations totaled 2.4) million, or 0.11) per common share (based on 22,824,221 weighted average shares outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2023). The net increase in net assets between the respective periods was due to higher unrealized appreciation, offset by higher realized losses in the current year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled 37.2 million, or 1.48 per common share (based on 25,066,626 weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled 6.0 million, or 0.28 per common share (based on 21,289,880 weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2023). The net increase in net assets between the respective periods was due to higher unrealized appreciation, offset by increased net realized losses in the current year.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Operating and Financing Activities Our operating activities provided net cash of 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily in connection with the net increase in net assets resulting from operations and sales and repayments of portfolio investments, offset by the purchase of portfolio investments. Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 provided cash of 9.4 million primarily from proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset by net paydowns on our Credit Facility and shareholder distibutions. Our operating activities used net cash of 42.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily in connection with the purchase of portfolio investments, offset by sales and repayments of portfolio investments. Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 provided cash of 13.6 million primarily from proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset by net paydowns on our Credit Facility. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity and capital resources are derived from the Credit Facility, Notes Payable, SBA-guaranteed debentures and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, the ATM Program (as defined below), and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and other operating expenses we incur, as well as the payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock. We used, and expect to continue to use, these capital resources as well as proceeds from turnover within our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment activities . Although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future public and private equity offerings and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, our plans to raise capital may not be successful. In this regard, if our common stock trades at a price below our then-current net asset value per share, we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital given that we cannot sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our Board makes certain determinations in connection therewith. A proposal, approved by our stockholders at our 2024 annual stockholders meeting, authorizes us to sell up to 25 of our outstanding common shares at a price equal to or below the then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings. This authorization will expire on the earlier of June 20, 2025 the one-year anniversary of our 2024 annual stockholders meeting or the date of our 2025 annual stockholder meeting. We would need similar future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval. In addition, we intend to distribute between 90 and 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value. Also, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet an asset coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, over the aggregate amount of the senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 150 effective June 29, 2018 (at least 200 prior to June 29, 2018). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of the Stellus Capital SBIC, LP (the SBIC subsidiary and Stellus Capital SBIC II, LP (the SBIC II subsidiary (collectively, the SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. We were in compliance with the asset coverage ratios at all times. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 242 and 223 , respectively. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 38.6 million and 26.1 million, respectively.

 Credit Facility On October 11, 2017, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement, as amended, dated as of October 10, 2017, that was amended and restated on December 21, 2021, February 28, 2022, May 13, 2022 and November 21, 2023, with Zions Bancorporation, N.A., dba Amegy Bank and various other lenders (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of 260.0 million on a committed basis with an accordion feature that allows us to increase the aggregate commitments up to 350.0 million, subject to new or existing lenders agreeing to participate in the increase and other customary conditions. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility will bear interest, subject to our election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) term SOFR plus 2.50 (or 2.75 during certain periods in which our asset coverage ratio is equal to or below 1.90 to 1.00) plus a SOFR credit spread adjustment (0.10 for one-month term SOFR and 0.15 for three-month term SOFR), with a 0.25 SOFR floor, or (ii) 1.50 (or 1.75 during certain periods in which the our asset coverage ratio is equal to or below 1.90 to 1.00) plus an alternate base rate based on the highest of the prime rate (subject to a 3 floor), Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 and one-month term SOFR plus 1.00 . We pay unused commitment fees of 0.50 per annum on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. Interest is payable monthly or quarterly in arrears. The commitment to fund the revolver expires on November 21, 2027, after which we may no longer borrow under the Credit Facility and must begin repaying principal equal to 1/12 of the aggregate amount outstanding under the Credit Facility each month. Any amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on November 21, 2028. Our obligations to the lenders are secured by a first priority security interest in our portfolio of securities and cash not held at the SBIC subsidiaries, but excluding short term investments. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including but not limited to: (i) maintaining a minimum liquidity test of at least 10.0 million, including cash, liquid investments and undrawn availability, (ii) maintaining an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.67 to 1.0, (iii) maintaining a minimum stockholder s equity, and (iv) maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 157.4 million and 160.1 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Credit Facility. The carrying amount of the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility approximates its fair value. The fair values of the Credit Facility is determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ), which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Credit Facility is estimated based upon market interest rates for our own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. We incurred costs of 6.7 million in connection with the current Credit Facility, which are being amortized over the life of the facility. Additionally, 0.3 million of costs from a prior credit facility will continue to be amortized over the remaining life of the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 2.8 million and 3.5 million of such prepaid loan structure fees and administration fees had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability. Interest is paid quarterly in arrears. The following table summarizes the interest expense and amortized loan fees on the Credit Facility for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):

 SBA-Guaranteed Debentures Due to the SBIC subsidiaries status as Small Business Investment Companies SBICs ), we have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates SBA-guaranteed debentures ). Under the regulations applicable to SBICs, a single licensee can have outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to a regulatory leverage limit, up to two times the amount of regulatory capital. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SBIC subsidiary had 75.0 million in regulatory capital , as such term is defined by the SBA, and 150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SBIC II subsidiary had 87.5 million in regulatory capital. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SBIC II subsidiary had 175.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. On August 12, 2014, we obtained exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of the SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from our 150 asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the 150 asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to 325.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. On a stand-alone basis, the SBIC subsidiaries held 498.7 million and 485.2 million in assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which accounted for approximately 52.7 and 53.4 of our total consolidated assets, respectively. SBA-guaranteed debentures have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing 10-year U.S. Treasury Note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre-paid at any time with no prepayment penalty. SBA-guaranteed debentures drawn before October 1, 2019 incur upfront fees of 3.425 , which consists of a 1.00 commitment fee and a 2.425 issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures drawn after October 1, 2019 incur upfront fees of 3.435 , which consists of a 1.00 commitment fee and a 2.435 issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures. Once pooled, which occurs in March and September of each applicable year, the SBA-guaranteed debentures bear interest at a fixed rate that is set to the current 10-year treasury rate plus a spread at each pooling date. The fair values of the SBA-guaranteed debentures are determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the SBA-guaranteed debentures is estimated based upon market interest rates for our own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SBA-guaranteed debentures would be deemed to be Level 3, as defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, we have incurred 11.1 million in financing costs related to the SBA-guaranteed debentures since the SBIC subsidiaries received their licenses, which were recorded as prepaid loan fees. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 3.9 million and 4.7 million of prepaid financing costs had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability.

 Notes Offering On January 14, 2021, we issued 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875 fixed-rate notes due 2026 (the Notes Payable ). The Notes Payable will mature on March 30, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after December 31, 2025 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the outstanding principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest is payable semi-annually beginning September 30, 2021. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of the Notes Payable were approximately 100.0 million. The Notes Payable are institutional, non-traded notes. In connection with the issuance of the Notes Payable, we have incurred 2.3 million of fees, which are being amortized over the term of the Notes Payable, of which 0.7 million and 1.0 million remains to be amortized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These financing costs are presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability. The following table summarizes the interest expense and deferred financing costs on the Notes Payable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions): 

For the three months ended For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Interest expense 1.2 1.2 3.7 3.7 Deferred financing costs 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Total interest and financing expenses 1.3 1.3 4.0 4.0 Weighted average interest rate 4.8 4.8 4.9 4.9 Effective interest rate (including fee amortization) 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 Average debt outstanding 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cash paid for interest 2.4 2.4 4.9 4.9 ATM Program On August 11, 2023, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement with Keefe Bruyette Woods, Inc. and Raymond James Associates, Inc., as sales agents and/or principal thereunder. Under the Equity Distribution Agreement, we may issue and sell, from time to time, up to 100,000,000 in aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, with the intention to use the net proceeds from this at-the-market sales program to repay certain outstanding indebtedness and make investments in portfolio companies in accordance with its investment objective and strategies. We refer to our issuance and sale of shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement as the ATM Program. We issued 1,058,366 and 2,913,722 shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 under the ATM Program, respectively, for gross proceeds of 14.6 million and 40.4 million and underwriting fees and other expenses of 0.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively. The average per share offering price of shares issued in the ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.79 and 13.86, respectively. The Advisor agreed to reimburse us for underwriting fees and expenses to the extent the per share price of the shares to the public, less underwriting fees, was less then net asset value per share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Advisor was not required to reimburse underwriting fees as all shares were issued at a premium to net asset value. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024, we had 38.3 million in unfunded debt commitments and 0.3 million in unfunded equity commitments to 58 existing portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2023, we had 36.7 million in unfunded debt commitments and 0.3 million in unfunded equity commitments to 57 existing portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024, we had sufficient liquidity (through cash on hand and available borrowings under the Credit Facility) to fund such unfunded loan commitments should the need arise .

 Regulated Investment Company Status and Dividends We have elected, have qualified, and intend to qualify annually to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. So long as we maintain our qualification as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to stockholders as dividends on a timely basis. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Distributions declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year. Distributions also may include returns of capital. To qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any). If we maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must also satisfy certain distribution requirements each calendar year in order to avoid a federal excise tax on our undistributed earnings of a RIC. As of December 31, 2023, we had 37.0 million of undistributed taxable income that will be carried forward toward distributions paid during the year ending December 31, 2024. We intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90 and 100 of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, the covenants contained in the Credit Facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year, a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in Credit Facility. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. In accordance with certain applicable U.S. Treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20 of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20 of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these U.S. Treasury regulations or private letter rulings. However, we continue to monitor the Company s liquidity position and the overall economy and will continue to assess whether it would be in our and our shareholders best interest to take advantage of the IRS rulings.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. In September 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Federal Reserve") reduced interest rates for the first time since March 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing the target for the federal funds rate down to 4.75 - 5.00 from 5.25 - 5.50 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 95 and 98 of the loans in our portfolio bore interest at a floating rate, respectively. These floating rate loans typically bear interest in reference to SOFR, which is indexed to 30-day or 90-day SOFR rates, subject to an interest rate floor. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate floor on our floating rate loans was 1.44 and 1.26 , respectively. Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of changes in interest rates: 

in millions) Interest Interest Net Interest Change in Basis Points (2) Income Expense (3) Income (1) Up 200 basis points 15.6 (3.1) 12.5 Up 150 basis points 11.7 (2.4) 9.3 Up 100 basis points 7.8 (1.6) 6.2 Up 50 basis points 3.9 (0.8) 3.1 Down 50 basis points (3.9) 0.8 (3.1) Down 100 basis points (7.8) 1.6 (6.2) Down 150 basis points (11.7) 2.4 (9.3) Down 200 basis points (15.6) 3.1 (12.5) 

 (1) Excludes the impact of incentive fees based on pre-incentive fee net investment income. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more information on the incentive fee. (2) At September 30, 2024, the three-month SOFR rate was 459 basis points. This table assumes floating rates would not fall below zero. (3) Includes the impact of the 25 bps SOFR floor in place on the Credit Facility. 
 Although we believe that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contacts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not engage in hedging activities. Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of various members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management did not identify any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
