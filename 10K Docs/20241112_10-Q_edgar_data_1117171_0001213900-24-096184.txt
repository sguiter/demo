Notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023 and 2024 

(Unaudited) 

(In US except for number of shares) 

7 

shares of common stock for gross proceeds of . In conjunction with this financing,
Mr. Xiangqian Li, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company Mr. Li until March 1, 2016, agreed to place
 shares of the Company s common stock owned by him into an escrow account pursuant to an Escrow Agreement dated January
20, 2005 (the Escrow Agreement ). 

Under accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America US GAAP ), escrow agreements such as the one established by Mr. Li generally constitute
compensation if, following attainment of a performance threshold, shares are returned to a company officer. The Company determined that
without consideration of the compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended September 30, 2005 would be achieved.
However, after consideration of a related compensation charge, the Company determined that such thresholds would not have been achieved.
The Company also determined that, even without consideration of a compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended
September 30, 2006 would not be achieved. 

While the escrow shares relating to the
2005 performance threshold were previously released to Mr. Li, Mr. Li executed a further undertaking on August 21, 2006 to return those
shares to the escrow agent for the distribution to the relevant investors. However, such shares were not returned to the escrow agent,
but, pursuant to a Delivery of Make Good Shares, Settlement and Release Agreement between the Company, BAK International and Mr. Li entered
into on October 22, 2007 (the Li Settlement Agreement ), such shares were ultimately delivered to the Company as described
below. Because the Company failed to satisfy the performance threshold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the remaining 
escrow shares relating to the fiscal year 2006 performance threshold were released to the relevant investors. As Mr. Li has not retained
any of the shares placed into escrow, and as the investors party to the Escrow Agreement are only shareholders of the Company and do
not have and are not expected to have any other relationship to the Company, the Company has not recorded a compensation charge for the
years ended September 30, 2005 and 2006. 

At the time the escrow shares relating to the
2006 performance threshold were transferred to the investors in fiscal year 2007, the Company should have recognized a credit to donated
shares and a debit to additional paid-in capital, both of which are elements of shareholders equity. This entry is not material
because total ordinary shares issued and outstanding, total shareholders equity and total assets do not change; nor is there any
impact on income or earnings per share. Therefore, previously filed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September
30, 2007 will not be restated. This share transfer has been reflected in these financial statements by reclassifying the balances of
certain items as of October 1, 2007. The balances of donated shares and additional paid-in capital as of October 1, 2007 were credited
and debited by respectively, as set out in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity. 

In November 2007, Mr. Li delivered the 
shares related to the 2005 performance threshold to BAK International pursuant to the Li Settlement Agreement; BAK International in turn
delivered the shares to the Company. Such shares (other than those issued to investors pursuant to the 2008 Settlement Agreements, as
described below) are now held by the Company. Upon receipt of these shares, the Company and BAK International released all claims and
causes of action against Mr. Li regarding the shares, and Mr. Li released all claims and causes of action against the Company and BAK
International regarding the shares. Under the terms of the Li Settlement Agreement, the Company commenced negotiations with the investors
who participated in the Company s January 2005 private placement in order to achieve a complete settlement of BAK International s
obligations (and the Company s obligations to the extent it has any) under the applicable agreements with such investors. 

8 

of the number of the
escrow shares related to the 2005 performance threshold these investors had claimed; aggregate settlement payments as of June 30, 2015amounted
to shares. Share payments to date have been made in reliance upon the exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(2) and/or
other applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In accordance with the 2008 Settlement Agreements, the Company
filed a registration statement covering the resale of such shares which was declared effective by the SEC on June 26, 2008. 

Pursuant to the Li Settlement Agreement, the
2008 Settlement Agreements and upon the release of the escrow shares relating to the fiscal year 2006 performance threshold to
the relevant investors, neither Mr. Li or the Company have any obligations to the investors who participated in the Company s January
2005 private placement relating to the escrow shares. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not
received any claim from the other investors who have not been covered by the 2008 Settlement Agreements in the January
2005 private placement. 

As the Company has transferred the shares
related to the 2006 performance threshold to the relevant investors in fiscal year 2007 and the Company also have transferred 
shares relating to the 2005 performance threshold to the investors who had entered the 2008 Settlement Agreements with
us in fiscal year 2008, pursuant to Li Settlement Agreement and 2008 Settlement Agreements , neither Mr. Li
nor the Company had any remaining obligations to those related investors who participated in the Company s January 2005 private
placement relating to the escrow shares.

The transaction resulted in a purchase price
allocation of to goodwill, representing the financial, strategic and operational value of the transaction to the Company.
Goodwill is attributed to the premium that the Company paid to obtain the value of the business of Hitrans and the synergies expected
from the combined operations of Hitrans and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in provision of raw
materials used in manufacturing of lithium batteries. The total amount of the goodwill acquired is not deductible for tax purposes.

at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the asset
might be impaired. Goodwill was fully impaired as of December 31, 2022. 

The Company performed goodwill impairment test
at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the asset
might be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, the Company performed testing on reporting unit of NCM precursor and cathode materials products Hitrans Reporting unit 

The Company first assessed qualitative factors
to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For those reporting
units where it is determined that it is more likely than not that their fair values are less than the units carrying amounts,
the Company will perform the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. After performing the assessment, if the
carrying amounts of the reporting units are higher than their fair values, the Company will perform the second step of the two-step quantitative
goodwill impairment test. 

The Company performed qualitative assessments
for Hitrans reporting unit. Based on the requirements of ASC 350-20-35-3C through ASC 350-20-35-3G, the Company evaluated all relevant
factors, weighed all factors in their totality. For the year ended December 31, 2022, as the financial performance of Hitrans reporting
unit was below original expectations, fair value of this reporting unit was indicated to be lower than its carrying value. For this reporting
unit, where it was determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was less than the units carrying amount after
performing the qualitative assessment, as a result, the Company performed the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for these
two reporting units. 

For the two-step goodwill impairment test, the
Company estimated the fair value with either income approach or asset approach for specific reporting unit components. With the income
approach, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are
based on the best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected expansion, pricing, market share,
and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing
revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Asset based approach
is used in evaluating the fair value of some specific components which is deemed as the most prudent approach due to the unpredictability
of future cash flows.

for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impairment
loss of goodwill was primarily attributable to the impairment related to Hitrans reporting unit as the financial performance of the reporting
unit of Hitrans continued to fall below the Company s original expectations.

Overview 

We are a manufacturer of new energy high power
lithium batteries that are mainly used in light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage such as residential
energy supply uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications, and other high-power applications. Our primary product offerings
consist of new energy high power lithium batteries and sodium batteries. In addition, after completing the acquisition of 81.56 of registered
equity interests (representing 75.57 of paid-up capital) of Hitrans in November 2021, we entered the business of developing and manufacturing
NCM precursor and cathode materials. Hitrans is a leading developer and manufacturer of ternary precursor and cathode materials in China,
whose products have a wide range of applications including electric vehicles, electric tools, high-end digital products and storage,
among others. 

We acquired our operating assets, including customers,
employees, patents and technologies from our former subsidiary BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd. We acquired these assets in exchange
for a reduction in accounts receivable from our former subsidiaries that were disposed of in June 2014. 

As of September 30, 2024, we report financial
and operational information in two segments: (i) production of high-power lithium and sodium battery cells and (ii) manufacture and sales
of materials used in high power lithium battery cells. 

We currently conduct our business primarily through
(i) CBAK Power, (ii) Nanjing CBAK, (iii) CBAK Shangqiu, (iv) Nanjing BFD, and (v) Hitrans. 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024 and other reports filed with the SEC, we started construction of
our Nanjing facilities to expand our lithium battery manufacturing capabilities in 2020. The project comprises two phases. Phase I, encompassing
an area of approximately 27,173 square meters, was put into operation in the second half of 2021. Since then, we have been steadily increasing
Phase I s production capacity, which currently stands at 2 GWh. Construction of the Phase II began in 2022 and includes three major
manufacturing plants. The construction of the ceiling stage for the first of these three plants in Phase II was completed in 2023, and
we anticipate it will commence operations in 2025. Once fully operational, the Nanjing facilities are projected to provide a total capacity
of 20 GWh to support our customers growing demand. In 2023, our client demand for batteries soared, prompting us to rent additional
manufacturing space in Shangqiu, Henan, PRC. Our Shangqiu facility has a capacity of 0.5 GWh per year. We have two production lines at
this leased facility, and the renovation costs were covered by the owner. We have been expanding our business by developing new products,
fostering new partnerships and strategic acquisition of companies that complement and augment our business. 

51 

The clean energy industry is of strategic importance
in China and many other countries. With the global emphasis on the new energy industry, we anticipate securing more potential orders
from our clients. The Chinese government has been providing support for the development of new energy facilities and vehicles for several
years. Considering our major operations are in China, the policy support to the new energy industry is crucial to our business. With
the growing demand for high-power lithium-ion and sodium-ion products, we are optimistic about our future prospects.

Financial Statement Presentation 

Net revenues. The Company recognizes
revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects
to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09:

price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we
satisfy the performance obligation. 

Revenues from product sales are recognized when
the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental
costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred it the expected amortization period of the asset that it would have recognized is
on year or less or the amount is immaterial. 

Revenue from product sales is recorded net of
reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers. 

Product revenue reserves, which are classified
as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the categories: discounts and returns. These reserves are based on
estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable as the
amount is payable to the Company s customer. 

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
consists primarily of material costs, employee remuneration for staff engaged in production activity, share-based compensation, depreciation
and related expenses that are directly attributable to the production of products. Cost of revenues also includes write-downs of inventory
to lower of cost and net realizable value.

Net revenues from sales of batteries for
electric vehicles were 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.4 million in the same period of
2023. 

Net revenues from sales of batteries for light electric vehicles were
 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.1 million in the same period of 2023, marking an increase
of 3.8 million, or 341 .The light electric vehicle market experienced growth starting from second quarter of 2024. We strive to continue
to penetrate the market for batteries used in light electric vehicles, especially the international market such as India. 

Net revenues from sales of batteries for residential energy supply
 uninterruptable power supplies were 28.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 42.8 million in
the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 14.6 million, or 34 . The decrease in sales of batteries for residential energy supply
 uninterruptable supplies in the third quarter of 2024 was largely attributed to the fact that one-month suspension of production
at our Dalian factory. For the first eight months of 2024, our Dalian factory operated at full capacity without any breaks, which led
to a significant increase in energy costs. To mitigate these costs and enable upgrades, we paused operations for a month. During this
period, we optimized energy usage and upgraded one production line to support the production of our new tabless model 26650. 

Net revenues from sales of materials used in
manufacturing of lithium batteries were 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 19.1 million for
the same period of 2023. This primarily resulted from a continued decrease in raw material prices during 2024, which led to significant
downward pressure on the pricing of our battery material products. 

Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
decreased to 37.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 51.2 million for the same period in 2023, a
decrease of 13.5 million, or 26 . The cost of revenues includes written down of obsolete inventories of 1.4 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to write down of obsolete inventories of 0.5 million for the same period in 2023. We write down
the inventory value whenever there is an indication that it is impaired. 

Gross profit . Gross profit for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.0 million, or 15.6 of net revenues as compared to gross profit of 12.2 million, or 19.3 
of net revenues, for the same period in 2023. 

54 

Research and development expenses .
 Research and development expenses were 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 aa compared to 2.6 million for
the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 2.3 million in salaries, social insurance and share-based
compensation, compared to 1.4 million for the same period in 2023, representing an increase of 0.9 million or 39 due to a growing
number of employees at Nanjing CBAK and new operation in Shangqiu. 

Sales and marketing expenses . Sales
and marketing expenses slightly decreased to approximately 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to
approximately 1.1 million for the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses were 2.3 and 1.8 
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses
decreased to 2.8 million, or 6.2 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.2 million, or 5.1 of
revenues, for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of 0.4 million, or 14 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we incurred less professional fees as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Provision for doubtful accounts.

ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We determine the allowance based on historical
write-off experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions. 

Operating income (loss) . As a result
of the above, our operating loss was 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an operating income of
 5.3 million for the same period in 2023, representing a 6.1 million decrease or 116 . 

Finance expenses, net. Finance expense,
net was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.4 million for the same period in 2023, representing
a decrease of 0.3 million in expenses. The finance expense decrease mainly resulted from a decrease of our average loan balance and capitalization
of interest from bank borrowings. We capitalized interest on bank borrowings of 0.2 million and 0.2 million to the cost of construction
in progress for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Other income (expenses) , net. Other
income was 0.5 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Changes in fair value of warrants liability.
 We issued warrants in the financings we consummated in December 2020 and February 2021. We determined that these warrants should
be accounted for as derivative liabilities, as the warrants are dominated in a currency (U.S. dollar) other than our functional currency.
The change in fair value of warrants liability is mainly due to the share price fluctuations. 

Income tax credit (expenses). Income
tax expenses were 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income tax credit of 0.3 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2023.

we had a net income of 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.6 million for the same period in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had financed our liquidity requirements from
a variety of sources, including short-term bank loans, other short-term loans and bills payable under bank credit agreements, advance
from our related and unrelated parties, investors and issuance of capital stock and other equity-linked securities. 

We generated a net income of 16.3 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 47.9 million. Our total current
assets were 130.5 million and our total current liabilities were 154.2 million as of September 30, 2024, resulting in a net working
capital deficit of 23.7 million.

deficit of 118.1 million. We had an accumulated deficit from recurring net losses incurred for the prior years and significant short-term
debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubts about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023
included an explanatory paragraph in respect of the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. 

These condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We currently are expanding our product lines
and manufacturing capacity in our Dalian, Nanjing and Zhejiang facilities, which requires additional funding to finance the expansion.
We may also require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions
we may decide to pursue. We plan to renew these loans upon maturity, if required, and plan to raise additional funds through bank borrowings
and equity financing in the future to meet our daily cash demands, if required. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in obtaining this financing. If our existing cash and bank borrowing are insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell equity
securities, debt securities or borrow from lending institutions. We can make no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts
we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The sale of equity securities, including convertible debt securities, would dilute the
interests of our current shareholders. The incurrence of debt would divert cash for working capital and capital expenditures to service
debt obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends
to our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, our business operations and prospects
may suffer. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our condensed consolidated financial information
has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported
amounts of our assets and liabilities, (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each fiscal period and
(3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each fiscal period. We continually evaluate these estimates based on our own
historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, our expectations regarding the future based
on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results
could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application. 

There were no material changes to the critical
accounting policies previously disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included
in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 15, 2024. 

Changes in Accounting Standards 

Please refer to Note 1 to our condensed consolidated

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2024. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in
evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 

Management conducted its evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon, and as of the
date of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective as of September 30, 2024. 

As we disclosed in our Annual Report on Form
10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, during our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

We did not have appropriate
 policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements. 

We do not have sufficient
 and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. 

In order to cure the foregoing material weaknesses,
we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures: 

We are in the process of
 hiring a permanent chief financial officer with significant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience. Ms. Xiangyu Pei was appointed
 by the Board of Directors of the Company as the Interim Chief Financial Officer on August 23, 2019. Ms. Xiangyu Pei resigned as our
 Interim Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023 but has continued to serve in the Company s finance department and on the
 board of director. Mr. Jiewei Li was appointed as the Company s Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023. 

We have regularly offered
 our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. We have regularly provided trainings to our financial
 personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. We plan to continue to provide trainings to our financial team and our other relevant
 personnel on the U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to our financial reporting requirements. 

We intend to complete the remediation of the
material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and
implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes
in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system
that adequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address
the material weakness that we have identified. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the matters described above, there were no changes in our
internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
