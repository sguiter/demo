Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by improved and unimproved real estate, the value of which is dependent upon the real estate market. Risk characteristics of the major components of the Bank s loan portfolio are discussed below: Construction and land development loans The risk of loss is largely dependent on the initial estimate of whether the property s value at completion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction and the availability of take-out financing. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or cost overruns. If the estimate is inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan, sale of the property, or by seizure of collateral. Single-family residential loans Declining home sales volumes, decreased real estate values and higher than normal levels of unemployment could contribute to losses on these loans. Commercial real estate loans Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. These loans also involve greater risk because they are generally not fully amortizing over the loan period, but rather have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property. Commercial loans Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business. In addition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, be illiquid, or fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Multifamily and farmland loans Decreased real estate values and higher than normal levels of unemployment could contribute to losses on these loans. 14 Table of Contents Single-family residential Commercial Multifamily and farmland Total real estate loans Loans not secured by real estate: Commercial Farm Consumer All other Total loans - December 31, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Loans 30-89 Days Past Due Nonaccrual Loans Total Past Due Loans Total Current Loans Total Loans Accruing Loans 90 or More Days Past Due Real estate loans: Construction and land development Single-family residential Commercial Multifamily and farmland Total real estate loans Loans not secured by real estate: Commercial Farm Consumer All other Total loans - 15 Table of Contents Single-family residential Multifamily and farmland Total real estate loans Loans not secured by real estate: Commercial Consumer Total December 31, 2023 Nonaccrual Loans Nonaccrual Loans Total With No With Nonaccrual (Dollars in thousands) Allowance Allowance Loans Real estate loans: Construction and land development Single-family residential Multifamily and farmland Total real estate loans Loans not secured by real estate: Commercial Consumer Total No interest income was recognized on non-accrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. A change to the allowance for credit losses is evaluated based on the nature of the modification. Occasionally, the Bank modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. In some cases, the Bank may modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. The following tables show the amortized cost basis at September 30, 2024 and 2023 of the loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, disaggregated by loan class and type of concession granted. One 30,000 loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty was modified during the three months ended September 30, 2024. No loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were modified during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Modifications during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not presented in tables due to immateriality. 16 Table of Contents Interest rate reduction and term extension Commercial not secured by real estate Term extension Total (Dollars in thousands) Amortized Cost Basis at September 30, 2023 of Loan Class Modification Type Financial Effect Loan class: Single-family residential Term extension Commercial real estate Term extension Total No loans modified in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that were made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty had been written off at September 30, 2024 and 2023.

There were no collateral dependent loans individually evaluated at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bank utilizes several credit quality indicators to manage credit risk in an ongoing manner. The Bank uses an internal risk grade system that categorizes loans into pass, watch or substandard categories. The Bank uses the following credit quality indicators: Pass Includes loans ranging from excellent quality with a minimal amount of credit risk to loans with higher risk and servicing needs but still are considered to be acceptable. The higher risk loans in this category are not problem credits presently, but may be in the future if the borrower is unable to change its present course. Watch These loans are currently performing satisfactorily, but there has been some recent past due history on repayment and there are potential weaknesses that may, if not corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Bank s position at some future date. Substandard A Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged (if there is any). There is a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. There is a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful Loans classified Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified Substandard, plus the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable. Loss Loans classified Loss are considered uncollectable and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this worthless loan even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. 19 Table of Contents Watch Substandard Total Construction and land development Single family Pass Watch Substandard Total single family Commercial Pass Watch Substandard Total commercial Multifamily and farmland Pass Watch Substandard Total multifamily and farmland Total real estate loans Loans not secured by real estate Commercial Pass Watch Substandard Total Commercial Farm Pass Watch Substandard Total farm Consumer Pass Watch Substandard Total consumer All other Pass Watch Substandard Total all other Total loans not secured by real estate Total loans The following table presents by credit quality indicator, loan class and year of origination, gross loan charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Bank maintains operating leases on land and buildings for some of the Bank s branch facilities and loan production offices. Most leases include one option to renew, with renewal terms extending up to years. The exercise of renewal options is based on the judgment of management as to whether or not the renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised. Factors in determining whether an option is reasonably certain of exercise include, but are not limited to, the value of leasehold improvements, the value of renewal rates compared to market rates, and the presence of factors that would cause a significant economic penalty to the Bank if the option is not exercised. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and instead are recognized in lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The following table presents lease cost and other lease information as of September 30, 2024 and 2023.

These borrowings were collateralized with government-sponsored enterprise securities with a market value of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We monitor collateral levels on a continuous basis and maintain records of each transaction specifically describing the applicable security and the counterparty s fractional interest in that security, and we segregate the security from its general assets in accordance with regulations governing custodial holdings of securities. The primary risk with repurchase agreements is market risk associated with the securities securing the transactions, as we may be required to provide additional collateral based on fair value changes of the underlying securities. Standby letters of credit Commitments to extend credit are conditional agreements to lend to a customer. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and because they may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount of million does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to pay a third party on behalf of a customer. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to businesses in the Bank s delineated market area. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds real estate, equipment, automobiles and customer deposits as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit, commitments to extend future credit, when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancelable. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding activity and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments of million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is separately classified on the balance sheet within Other Liabilities. 23 Table of Contents Cummulative effect of change in accounting principle Recovery of credit losses Ending balance 1,159 2,131 24 Table of Contents U.S. Government sponsored enterprises GSE - Mortgage-backed securities Private label mortgage-backed securities State and political subdivisions (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2023 Fair Value Level 1 Valuation Level 2 Valuation Level 3 Valuation U.S. Treasuries U.S. Government sponsored enterprises GSE - Mortgage-backed securities Private label mortgage-backed securities State and political subdivisions The fair value measurements for individually evaluated loans on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented below.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of the financial position and results of operations of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report of Form 10-K and the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto on pages A-20 through A-62 of the Company s 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders which is Appendix A to the Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Introduction Management s discussion and analysis of earnings and related data are presented to assist in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The Company is the parent company of the Bank and a registered bank holding company operating under the supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ). The Bank is a North Carolina-chartered bank, with offices in Catawba, Lincoln, Alexander, Mecklenburg, Iredell, Wake, Rowan and Forsyth counties, operating under the banking laws of North Carolina and the rules and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ). Overview Our business consists principally of attracting deposits from the general public and investing these funds in commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans and consumer loans. Our profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the income we receive on our loan and investment securities portfolios and our cost of funds, which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income also is affected by the relative amounts of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, a positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. Our profitability is also affected by the level of other income and operating expenses. Other income consists primarily of miscellaneous fees related to our loans and deposits, mortgage banking income and commissions from sales of annuities and mutual funds. Operating expenses consist of compensation and benefits, occupancy related expenses, federal deposit and other insurance premiums, data processing, advertising and other expenses. Our operations are influenced significantly by local economic conditions and by policies of financial institution regulatory authorities. The earnings on our assets are influenced by the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, inflation, interest rates, market and monetary fluctuations. Lending activities are affected by the demand for commercial and other types of loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered. Our cost of funds is influenced by interest rates on competing investments and by rates offered on similar investments by competing financial institutions in our market area, as well as general market interest rates. These factors can cause fluctuations in our net interest income and other income. In addition, local economic conditions can impact the credit risk of our loan portfolio, in that (1) local employers may be required to eliminate employment positions of individual borrowers, and (2) small businesses and commercial borrowers may experience a downturn in their operating performance and become unable to make timely payments on their loans. Management evaluates these factors in estimating the allowance for credit losses ACL , allowance for credit losses , or allowance and changes in these economic factors could result in increases or decreases to the provision for loan losses. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic conditions, while not as robust as the period from 2004 to 2007, had stabilized such that businesses in our market area were growing and investing again. The uncertainty expressed in the local, national and international markets through the primary economic indicators of activity were previously sufficiently stable to allow for reasonable economic growth in our markets. Subsequently, continuing supply-chain disruption and rising inflation has caused the Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee FOMC to increase the target federal funds rate 500 basis points between March 2022 and July 2023 before being reduced to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 in September 2024. Although we are unable to control the external factors that influence our business, by maintaining high levels of balance sheet liquidity, managing our interest rate exposures and by actively monitoring asset quality, we seek to minimize the potentially adverse risks of unforeseen and unfavorable economic trends. Because the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature (payable in fixed, determinable amounts), the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation. Interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases, but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same. The effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plants and inventories. During periods of high inflation there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans, and deposits. Also, general increases in the price of goods and services can be expected to result in increased operating expenses. 28 Table of Contents Our business emphasis has been and continues to be to operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community-oriented financial institution dedicated to providing quality customer service. We are committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which we operate. We expect growth to be achieved in our local markets and through expansion opportunities in contiguous or nearby markets. While we would be willing to consider growth by acquisition in certain circumstances, we do not consider the acquisition of another company to be necessary for our continued ability to provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. We believe that we can be more effective in serving our customers than many of our non-local competitors because of our ability to quickly and effectively provide senior management responses to customer needs and inquiries. Our ability to provide these services is enhanced by the stability and experience of our Bank officers and managers. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The Company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. Many of the Company s accounting policies require significant judgment regarding valuation of assets and liabilities and/or significant interpretation of specific accounting guidance. A complete description of the Company s significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders which is Appendix A to the Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. There have been no significant changes to the application of significant accounting policies since December 31, 2023. Results of Operations Summary. Net earnings were 4.0 million or 0.74 per share and 0.72 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.1 million or 0.76 per share and 0.74 per diluted share for the prior year period. The decrease in third quarter net earnings is primarily the result of a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, which were partially offset by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, compared to the prior year period, as discussed below. Net earnings were 12.8 million or 2.41 per share and 2.33 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.1 million or 2.22 per share and 2.15 per diluted share for the prior year period. The increase in year-to-date net earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in non-interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, compared to the prior year period, as discussed below. The annualized return on average assets was 0.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.02 for the same period one year ago, and annualized return on average shareholders equity was 13.59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.97 for the same period one year ago. Net Interest Income. Net interest income, the major component of the Company s net income, is the amount by which interest and fees generated by interest-earning assets exceed the total cost of funds used to carry them. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned and rates paid. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average interest-earning assets, and represents the Company s net yield on its interest-earning assets. Net interest income was 13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income is due to a 2.2 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a 2.0 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income is primarily due to a 2.0 million increase in interest income and fees on loans and a 206,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve through July 2023. The increase in interest income on investment securities is primarily due to increases in yields on variable rate securities and higher yields on securities purchased since September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income after the provision for credit losses was 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 297,000, compared to 562,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding with approximately 12.0 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This reduction of provision of 152,000 due to change in loan mix was offset by a 669,000 additional qualitative reserve established during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene, which heavily impacted western North Carolina in late September 2024. 29 Table of Contents Interest income was 20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income is primarily due to a 2.0 million increase in interest income and fees on loans and a 206,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve through July 2023. The increase in interest income on investment securities is primarily due to increases in yields on variable rate securities and higher yields on securities purchased since September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average loans were 1.12 billion, an increase of 56.4 million from average loans of 1.06 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average investment securities available for sale were 440.5 million, a decrease of 7.5 million from average investment securities available for sale of 448.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.72 and 5.27 , respectively. The average yield on investment securities available for sale was 3.38 and 3.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average yield on earning assets was 5.06 and 4.65 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense was 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-bearing non-maturity deposits were 725.0 million, an increase of 72.3 million from average interest-bearing non-maturity deposits of 652.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average certificates of deposit were 342.8 million, an increase of 74.1 million from average certificates of deposit of 268.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate paid on interest-bearing checking and savings accounts was 1.59 and 1.06 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit was 4.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.71 for the same period one year ago. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.51 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.92 for the same period one year ago. The following table sets forth for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amounts outstanding, the interest incurred on such amounts and the average rate earned or incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The table also sets forth the average rate earned on total interest-earning assets, the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities, and the net yield on total average interest-earning assets for the same periods. Yield information does not give effect to changes in fair value of available for sale investment securities that are reflected as a component of shareholders equity. Yields and interest income on tax-exempt investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using an effective tax rate of 22.98 for securities that are both federal and state tax exempt and an effective tax rate of 20.48 for federal tax-exempt securities. Non-accrual loans and the interest income that was recorded on non-accrual loans, if any, are included in the yield calculations for loans in all periods reported. The Company believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis provides comparability of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability within the industry. Although the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented below. 30 Table of Contents Three months ended Three months ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Interest Yield / Rate Average Balance Interest Yield / Rate Interest-earning assets: Loans receivable 1,120,545 16,098 5.72 1,064,135 14,145 5.27 Investments - taxable 304,083 3,039 3.98 305,405 2,767 3.59 Investments - nontaxable 139,665 727 2.07 145,820 794 2.16 Due from banks 45,434 608 5.32 45,938 606 5.23 Total interest-earning assets 1,609,727 20,472 5.06 1,561,298 18,312 4.65 Non-interest earning assets: Cash and due from banks 29,235 34,105 Allowance for credit losses (10,023 (9,731 Other assets 24,263 17,127 Total assets 1,653,202 1,602,799 Interest-bearing liabilities: Interest-bearing demand, MMDA savings deposits 725,045 2,892 1.59 652,739 1,752 1.06 Time deposits 342,757 3,611 4.19 268,670 2,512 3.71 Junior subordinated debentures 15,464 283 7.28 15,464 284 7.29 Other 14,114 132 3.72 87,117 418 1.90 Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,097,380 6,918 2.51 1,023,990 4,966 1.92 Non-interest bearing liabilities and shareholders' equity: Demand deposits 412,317 451,842 Other liabilities 16,040 15,440 Shareholders' equity 127,465 111,527 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity 1,653,202 1,602,799 Net interest spread 13,554 2.55 13,346 2.73 Net yield on interest-earning assets 3.35 3.39 Taxable equivalent adjustment Investment securities 5 6 Net interest income 13,549 13,340 Includes U.S. Government agency securities that are non-taxable for state income tax purposes of 9.9 million in 2024 and 11.6 million in 2023. A tax rate of 2.50 was used to calculate the tax equivalent yield on these securities. Year to date net interest income was 40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 41.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income is due to a 8.8 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a 7.6 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest income reflects a 6.1 million increase in interest income and fees on loans, a 734,000 increase in interest income on balances due from banks and a 795,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve through July 2023. The increase in interest income on balances due from banks is also due to an increase in average balances outstanding and Federal Reserve rate increases. The increase in interest income on investment securities is primarily due to increases in yields on variable rate securities and higher yields on securities purchased since September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income after the provision for credit losses was 40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a recovery of 80,000, compared to an expense of 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding with approximately 34.3 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This reduction of provision of 948,000 due to change in loan mix was partially offset by a 669,000 additional qualitative reserve established during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene, which heavily impacted western North Carolina in late September 2024. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 956,000, compared to 297,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to commercial and industrial loan charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30 2024, which were previously reflected in reserves on individually evaluated loans. 31 Table of Contents Interest income was 60.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income reflects a 6.1 million increase in interest income and fees on loans, a 734,000 increase in interest income on balances due from banks and a 795,000 increase in interest income on investment securities. The increase in interest income and fees on loans is primarily due to an increase in total loans and rate increases by the Federal Reserve through July 2023.

The average yield on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.65 and 5.17 , respectively. The average yield on investment securities available for sale was 3.37 and 3.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average yield on earning assets was 5.01 and 4.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense was 20.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in time deposits and an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-bearing non-maturity deposits were 686.2 million, a decrease of 23.8 million from average interest-bearing non-maturity deposits of 710.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The changes in net interest income due to both volume and rate changes have been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each. 33 Table of Contents Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Changes in average volume Changes in average rates Total Increase (Decrease) Changes in average volume Changes in average rates Total Increase (Decrease) Interest income: Loans: Net of unearned income 780 1,173 1,953 2,218 3,894 6,112 Investments - taxable (13 285 272 (361 1,214 853 Investments - nontaxable (33 (34 (67 (31 (73 (104 Due from banks (7 9 2 603 131 734 Total interest income 727 1,433 2,160 2,429 5,166 7,595 Interest expense: Interest-bearing demand, MMDA savings deposits 241 899 1,140 (210 2,712 2,502 Time deposits 737 362 1,099 4,115 2,139 6,254 Junior subordinated debentures - (1 (1 - 59 59 Other (517 231 (286 (369 375 6 Total interest expense 461 1,491 1,952 3,536 5,285 8,821 Net interest income 266 (58 208 (1,107 (119 (1,226 Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 297,000, compared to 562,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding composed mostly of approximately 12.0 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This reduction of reserves due to change in loan mix was partially offset by a 669,000 additional qualitative reserve established during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene, which heavily impacted western North Carolina in late September 2024. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a recovery of 80,000, compared to an expense of 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses is primarily attributable to a reduction in reserves on construction loans, which was primarily due to a decrease in construction loan balances outstanding with approximately 34.3 million in loans being paid off or transitioning to permanent financing in loan categories within the portfolio with lower loss rates than the construction pool during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This reduction of reserves due to change in loan mix was partially offset by 669,000 additional qualitative reserve during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene, which heavily impacted western North Carolina in late September 2024. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 956,000, compared to 297,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily due to commercial and industrial loan charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30 2024, which were previously reflected in reserves on individually evaluated loans. Additional individual reserves for commercial loans of 432,000, increased the percentage of reserves this category represented of total reserves. During the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the individual reserves amount were charged off, lowering the reserve levels needed for commercial loans at September 30, 2024. No other commercial loans have been identified for individual analysis which would require additional reserves for the commercial category. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income was 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a 288,000 increase in appraisal management fee income due to an increase in appraisal volume. Non-interest income was 20.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a 2.5 million net loss on the sales of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to a 5,000 net gain on the sales of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a 1.2 million increase in appraisal management fee income due to an increase in appraisal volume. 34 Table of Contents Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributable to a 458,000 increase in occupancy expense primarily due to a 362,000 write-off of leasehold improvements for the Bank s branch in Cary, North Carolina, which was closed in June 2024, a 254,000 increase in appraisal management fee expense due to an increase in appraisal volume and a 184,000 increase in professional fees primarily due to an increase in consulting fees. Increases noted above were partially offset by a 120,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily due to a decrease in medical insurance expense. Non-interest expense was 44.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 41.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily attributable to a 901,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits expense primarily due to annual salary increases and an increase in medical insurance expenses, a 679,000 increase in occupancy expense primarily due to a 362,000 write-off of leasehold improvements for the Bank s branch in Cary, North Carolina, which was closed in June 2024, a 362,000 increase in professional fees primarily due to an increase in consulting fees and a 982,000 increase in appraisal management fee expense due to an increase in appraisal volume. Income Taxes. Income tax expense was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 25.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax asset during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to upcoming reductions in the North Carolina corporate income tax rate, which will be decreased to zero over a five year period starting in 2025. Income tax expense was 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 21.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Analysis of Financial Condition Investment Securities. Available for sale securities were 398.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 391.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Average investment securities available for sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 443.0 million, compared to 454.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Loans. Total loans were 1.12 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.09 billion at December 31, 2023. Average loans represented 69 of average earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. The Bank had 1.2 million and 686,000 in mortgage loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, which is dependent upon the real estate market. Real estate mortgage loans include both commercial and residential mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 120.9 million in residential mortgage loans, 109.5 million in home equity loans and 680.4 million in commercial mortgage loans, which include 532.8 million secured by commercial property and 147.6 million secured by residential property. At December 31, 2023, the Bank had 112.8 million in residential mortgage loans, 107.7 million in home equity loans and 639.9 million in commercial mortgage loans, which include 488.9 million secured by commercial property and 151.0 million secured by residential property. All residential mortgage loans are originated as fully amortizing loans, with no negative amortization Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL). The allowance for credit losses reflects management s assessment and estimate of the risks associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. The Bank periodically analyzes the loan portfolio in an effort to review asset quality and to establish an allowance that management believes will be adequate in light of anticipated risks and loan losses. In assessing the adequacy of the allowance, size, quality and risk of loans in the portfolio are reviewed. The allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in loans as of September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses is estimated by management using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company measures expected credit losses for loans on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company calculates the allowance for credit losses using a Weighted Average Remaining Maturity WARM methodology. 35 Table of Contents The allowance for credit losses on loans was 10.6 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 11.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans is primarily due to a 471,000 decrease in allowance for other construction loans, all land development, and other land loans as a result of loan balance decreases in this category during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 360,000 decrease in allowance for commercial and industrial loans primarily due to a 432,000 decrease in reserves on individually evaluated loans in this category at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 due to charge offs during the first quarter of 2024. No other commercial loans have been identified for individual analysis which would require additional reserves for the commercial loans category. These decreases were partially offset by a 669,000 additional qualitative reserve for expected losses associated with established Hurricane Helene during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses calculation includes subjective adjustments for qualitative risk factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience. These qualitative adjustments may increase or reduce reserve levels and include adjustments for: local, state and national economic outlook; levels and trends of delinquencies; trends in volume, mix and size of loans; seasoning of the loan portfolio; experience of staff; concentrations of credit; and interest rate risk. The portion of the ACL balance attributable to qualitative factors was 5.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The risk factors are weighted as follows: Local, State and National Economic Outlook 30 , Concentrations of Credit 5 , Interest Rate Risk 5 , Trends in Terms of Volume, Mix and Size of Loans 15 , Seasoning of the Loan Portfolio 10 , Experience of Staff 10 , and Levels and Trends of Delinquencies 25 . No changes to the risk status of any of the risk factors was made during the third quarter of 2024. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that foreclosure is probable and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of collateral at the reporting date adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. There were no loans individually evaluated as of September 30, 2024, and two loans totaling 432,000 were individually evaluated as of December 31, 2023, which were fully reserved for at December 31, 2023. Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit issued to meet customer financing needs. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for off-balance sheet loan commitments represents the contractual amount of those instruments. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. The Company records an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, unless the commitments to extend credit are unconditionally cancelable. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date under the current expected credit loss model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur as well as any third-party guarantees. The allowance for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was 1.2 million and 1.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was primarily due to a 506,000 decrease in the allowance balance for other construction loans and all land development and other land loans resulting from a 16.3 million decrease in unfunded commitments in this category during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management uses several measures to assess and monitor the credit risks in the loan portfolio, including a loan grading system that begins upon loan origination and continues until the loan is collected or collectability becomes doubtful. Upon loan origination, the Bank s originating loan officer evaluates the quality of the loan and assigns one of eight risk grades. The loan officer monitors the loan s performance and credit quality and makes changes to the credit grade as conditions warrant. When originated or renewed, all loans over a certain dollar amount receive in-depth reviews and risk assessments by the Bank s Credit Administration. Before making any changes in these risk grades, management considers assessments as determined by the third-party credit review firm (as described below), regulatory examiners and the Bank s Credit Administration. Any issues regarding the risk assessments are addressed by the Bank s senior credit administrators and factored into management s decision to originate or renew the loan. The board of directors of the Bank the Bank Board reviews, on a monthly basis, an analysis of the Bank s reserves relative to the range of reserves estimated by the Bank s Credit Administration. As an additional measure, the Bank engages an independent third party to review the underwriting, documentation and risk grading analyses. This independent third party reviews and evaluates loan relationships greater than or equal to 1.5 million as well as a periodic sample of commercial relationships with exposures below 1.5 million, excluding loans in default, and loans in process of litigation or liquidation. The third party s evaluation and report is shared with management and the Bank Board. 36 Table of Contents Management considers certain commercial loans with weak credit risk grades to be individually impaired and measures such impairment based upon available cash flows and the value of the collateral. Allowance or reserve levels are estimated for all other graded loans in the portfolio based on their assigned credit risk grade, type of loan and other matters related to credit risk. Management uses the information developed from the procedures described above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio. This continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in estimating the allowance. The provision for credit losses charged or credited to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level appropriate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The amount each quarter is dependent upon many factors, including growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-offs, delinquencies, management s assessment of loan portfolio quality, the value of collateral, and other macro-economic factors and trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed quarterly by management through an analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance. Since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2023, the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses for the remaining estimated life of the Bank s financial assets, including loan receivables and some off-balance sheet credit exposures. Estimating the amount of the allowance for credit losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to historical experience, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the value of collateral on collateral-dependent loans. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet. Credit losses are charged against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for credit losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors. There are many factors affecting the allowance for credit losses; some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. Although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and is susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect our earnings or financial position in future periods. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance. Such agencies may require adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Management believes it has established the allowance for credit losses pursuant to CECL, and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment. Management considers the allowance adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the Bank s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. Although management uses the best information available to make evaluations, significant future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions, thus adversely affecting the operating results of the Company. Non-performing Assets. Non-performing assets were 3.9 million or 0.24 of total assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Non-accrual loans were 3.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As a percentage of total loans outstanding, non-accrual loans were 0.35 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.36 at December 31, 2023. Non-accrual loans over 250,000 are individually evaluated for specific reserves. Non-performing assets include 3.7 million in residential mortgage loans and 266,000 in other loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.4 million in residential mortgage loans and 464,000 in other loans at December 31, 2023. The Bank had no loans 90 days past due and still accruing at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bank had no other real estate owned at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Deposits. Deposits were 1.48 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.39 billion as of December 31, 2023. Core deposits, a non-GAAP measure, which include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, NOW, MMDA, savings and non-brokered certificates of deposit of denominations of 250,000 or less, were 1.34 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.24 billion at December 31, 2023. Management believes it is useful to calculate and present core deposits because of the positive impact this low cost funding source provides to the Bank s overall cost of funds and profitability. Certificates of deposit in amounts of more than 250,000 totaled 143.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 148.9 million December 31, 2023. Estimated uninsured deposits totaled 398.3 million, or 26.91 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024, compared to 382.1 million, or 27.45 of total deposits, at December 31, 2023. Uninsured amounts are estimated based on the portion of account balances in excess of FDIC insurance limits. The Bank did not have any significant deposit concentrations at September 30, 2024. Borrowed Funds. There were no FHLB borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Repurchase agreements were 8.4 million at September 30, 2023, compared to 86.7 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in repurchase agreements is primarily due to customers transferring funds from repurchase agreements to deposits via the IntraFi network s Insured Cash Sweep ICS during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 37 Table of Contents Junior Subordinated Debentures (related to Trust Preferred Securities). Junior subordinated debentures were 15.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Management. The objective of the Company s Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk strategies is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates and to minimize the interest rate risk between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at various maturities. This is done in conjunction with the need to maintain adequate liquidity and the overall goal of maximizing net interest income. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the Asset/Liability Committee ALCO of the Bank. The ALCO meets quarterly and has the responsibility for approving asset/liability management policies, formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and/or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the Company. ALCO seeks to minimize interest rate risk between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by attempting to minimize wide fluctuations in net interest income due to interest rate movements. The ability to control these fluctuations has a direct impact on the profitability of the Company. Management monitors this activity on a regular basis through analysis of its portfolios to determine the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. The Company s rate sensitive assets are those earning interest at variable rates and those with contractual maturities within one year. Rate sensitive assets therefore include both loans and available for sale securities. Rate sensitive liabilities include interest-bearing checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, time deposits and borrowed funds. Average rate sensitive assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1.61 billion, exceeding average rate sensitive liabilities of 1.09 billion by 517.1 million. The Company has an overall interest rate risk management strategy that may incorporate the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair-value gain in the derivative. The Company minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by the Company. The Company did not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Included in the rate sensitive assets are 185.6 million in variable rate loans indexed to prime rate subject to immediate repricing upon changes by the FOMC. Certain variable rate loans are structured to establish floors on interest rates charged to protect against downward movements in the prime rate. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 125.0 million in loans with interest rate floors. No floors were in effect on loans with floors on interest rates charged at September 30, 2024. Liquidity. The objectives of the Company s liquidity policy are to provide for the availability of adequate funds to meet the needs of loan demand, deposit withdrawals, maturing liabilities and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Both deposit and loan customer cash needs can fluctuate significantly depending upon business cycles, economic conditions and yields and returns available from alternative investment opportunities. In addition, the Company s liquidity is affected by off-balance sheet commitments to lend in the form of unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, such unfunded commitments to extend credit were 355.4 million, while commitments in the form of standby letters of credit totaled 3.8 million. As of December 31, 2023, such unfunded commitments to extend credit were 367.5 million, while commitments in the form of standby letters of credit totaled 3.7 million. The Bank uses several sources to meet its liquidity requirements. The primary source is core deposits, which includes demand deposits, savings accounts and non-brokered certificates of deposit of denominations less than 250,000. The Bank considers these to be a stable portion of the Bank s liability mix and the result of on-going consumer and commercial banking relationships. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s core deposits, a non-GAAP measure, totaled 1.34 billion, or 90 of total deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank s core deposits totaled 1.24 billion, or 89 of total deposits. The other sources of funding for the Bank are through large denomination certificates of deposit, including brokered deposits, federal funds purchased, securities under agreements to repurchase and FHLB borrowings. The Bank is also able to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank FRB on a short-term basis. The Bank s policies include the ability to access wholesale funding of up to 40 of total assets. The Bank s wholesale funding includes FHLB borrowings, FRB borrowings, brokered deposits, internet certificates of deposit and certificates of deposit issued to the State of North Carolina. The Bank had no wholesale funding at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.1 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank s ratio of wholesale funding to total assets was zero and 0.50 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 38 Table of Contents The Bank has a line of credit with the FHLB equal to 20 of the Bank s total assets. There were no FHLB borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of loans pledged as collateral to the FHLB totaled 218.6 million compared to 214.1 million at December 31, 2023. The remaining availability under the line of credit with the FHLB was 125.2 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 122.2 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank had no borrowings from the FRB at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. FRB borrowings are collateralized by a blanket assignment on all qualifying loans that the Bank owns which are not pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of loans pledged as collateral to the FRB totaled 633.5 million compared to 611.2 million at December 31, 2023. Availability under the line of credit with the FRB was 508.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 445.1 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank also had the ability to borrow up to 110.5 million for the purchase of overnight federal funds from five correspondent financial institutions as of September 30, 2024. The liquidity ratio for the Bank, which is defined as net cash, interest-bearing deposits, federal funds sold and certain investment securities, as a percentage of net deposits and short-term liabilities was 29.26 at September 30, 2024 and 25.39 at December 31, 2023. The minimum required liquidity ratio as defined in the Bank s Asset/Liability and Interest Rate Risk Management Policy was 10 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company s contractual obligations include junior subordinated debentures, as well as certain payments under current lease agreements. Other commitments include commitments to extend credit. Capital Resources. Shareholders equity was 136.3 million, or 8.20 of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared to 121.0 million, or 7.40 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Annualized return on average equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.59 , compared to 13.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total cash dividends paid on common stock were 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, whereby up to 2.0 million was allocated to repurchase the Company s common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 2.0 million to be allocated to repurchase the Company s common stock, which increased the total amount authorized in 2023 to 4.0 million. The Company repurchased approximately 4.0 million, or 181,022 shares of its common stock, under this stock repurchase program through March 31, 2024, when the program expired. In June of 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, whereby up to 2.0 million may be allocated to repurchase the Company s common stock. Any purchases under the Company s stock repurchase program may be made periodically as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements in the open market or in privately-negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any repurchase of shares will be determined by the Company s management, based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended at any time or from time-to-time without prior notice. The Company had not repurchased any shares of its common stock under this stock repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. In 2013, the FRB approved its final rule on the Basel III capital standards, which implement changes to the regulatory capital framework for banking organizations. The Basel III capital standards, which became effective January 1, 2015, include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were phased in from 2015 to 2019. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the final rules are as follows: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 (increased from 4 ); (iii) a total risk based capital ratio of 8 (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 (unchanged from previous rules). An additional capital conservation buffer was added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes beginning on January 1, 2016 and was phased in through 2019 (increasing by 0.625 on January 1, 2016 and each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5 on January 1, 2019). This resulted in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 , (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 , and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5 . Under the final rules, institutions would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained earnings that could be utilized for such actions. 39 Table of Contents Under the regulatory capital guidelines, financial institutions are currently required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 or greater, as required by the Basel III capital standards referenced above. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as shareholders equity and trust preferred securities less all intangible assets and goodwill. Tier 1 capital includes 15.0 million in trust preferred securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company s Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.35 and 13.94 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total risk-based capital is defined as Tier 1 capital plus supplementary capital. Supplementary capital, or Tier 2 capital, consists of the Company s allowance for credit losses, not exceeding 1.25 of the Company s risk-weighted assets. Total risk-based capital ratio is therefore defined as the ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. The Company s total risk-based capital ratio was 15.28 and 14.96 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s common equity Tier 1 capital consists of common stock and retained earnings. The Company s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.17 and 12.75 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Financial institutions are also required to maintain a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets of 4.0 or greater. The Company s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.78 and 10.51 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 14.23 and 13.83 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The total risk-based capital ratio for the Bank was 15.16 and 14.85 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.23 and 13.83 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.61 and 10.35 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A bank is considered to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5 or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater. Based upon these guidelines, the Bank was considered to be well capitalized at September 30, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in allowing timely decisions regarding disclosure to be made about material information required to be included in our periodic reports with the SEC.

OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In the opinion of management, the Company is not involved in any material pending legal proceedings other than routine proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business. Item 1A. Risk Factors For information regarding the risk factors that could affect the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, see the information under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. The following risk factor represent an update and addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. Damage resulting from Hurricane Helene and similar future events could have a negative impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Many communities in western North Carolina suffered significant damage resulting from Hurricane Helene. At this time, it is unclear to what extent our customers have been affected by uninsured business interruption, property destruction and other related losses, and how those events may affect each customer's ability to meet its debt service obligations. Similar future events could potentially cause widespread property damage, require the relocation of an unprecedented number of residents and business operations, and severely disrupt normal economic activity in our market areas, which may have an adverse effect on our operations, loan originations and deposit base. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have increased the allowance for credit losses by 669,000 as an estimate of expected losses associated with Hurricane Helene, additional reserve could be needed as we continue to assess the impact of Hurricane Helene on our customers. 41 Table of Contents Item 2.
