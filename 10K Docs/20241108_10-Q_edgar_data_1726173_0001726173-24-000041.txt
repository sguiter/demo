 Impairments prior to 2024 ) Impairment during the first nine months of 2024 ) Change in foreign exchange rates during the first nine months of 2024 Goodwill at September 30, 2024 

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss. There was impairment recorded by Steak n Shake for goodwill during the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, we performed our annual assessment of our recoverability of goodwill related to Western Sizzlin and an impairment to goodwill of was recorded. Western Sizzlin did record an impairment for goodwill during the first nine months of 2023. There was impairment recorded for intangible assets during the first nine months of 2024 and a impairment was recorded in the first nine months of 2023.

 of sales as well as of profits. We are therefore fully affected by the operating results of the business, unlike in a traditional franchising arrangement, where the franchisor obtains a royalty fee based on sales only. We generate most of our revenue from our share of the franchise partners profits. An initial franchise fee of thousand dollars is recognized when the operator becomes a franchise partner. The Company recognizes franchise partner fees monthly as underlying restaurant sales occur. 
 The Company leases or subleases property and equipment to franchise partners under lease arrangements. Both real estate and equipment rental payments are charged to franchise partners and are recognized in accordance with ASC 842, Leases . During the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, restaurant operations recognized and , respectively, in franchise partner fees related to rental income. During the first nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, restaurant operations recognized and , respectively, in franchise partner fees related to rental income. 
 Franchise Royalties and Fees 
 Franchise royalties and fees from Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin franchisees are based upon a percentage of sales of the franchise restaurant and are recognized as earned. Franchise royalties are billed on a monthly basis. Initial franchise fees when a new restaurant opens or at the start of a new franchise term are recorded as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the term of the franchise agreement. 
 Other Revenue 
 Restaurant operations sell gift cards to customers which can be redeemed for retail food sales within our stores. Gift cards are recorded as deferred revenue when issued and are subsequently recorded as net sales upon redemption. Restaurant operations estimate breakage related to gift cards when the likelihood of redemption is remote. This estimate utilizes historical trends based on the vintage of the gift card. Breakage on gift cards is recorded as other revenue in proportion to the rate of gift card redemptions by vintage.

 Cost of food, labor costs, and occupancy and other costs are expressed as a percentage of net sales. 
 General and administrative, marketing, other expenses, impairments, and depreciation are expressed as a percentage of total revenue. 
 
 Net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 39,660 and 119,210, respectively, representing an increase of 465 or 1.2 and 3,597 or 3.1 , compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in Steak n Shake s same-store sales of 5.4 during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 For company-operated units, sales to the end customer are recorded as revenue generated by the Company, but for franchise partner units, only our share of the restaurant s profits, along with certain fees, are recorded as revenue. Because we derive most of our revenue from our share of the profits, revenue will decline as we transition from company-operated units to franchise partner units.

 Our franchise partner fees were 17,157 during the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 17,622 during the third quarter of 2023. Franchise partner fees were 53,064 and 54,604 during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were 177 and 181 franchise partner units, respectively. Included in franchise partner fees were 5,780 and 5,692 of rental income during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 17,265 and 17,030 during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Franchise partners rent buildings and equipment from Steak n Shake. Our share of franchise partner fees was lower primarily because our franchise partners food and labor expenses were higher during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 The franchise royalties and fees generated by the traditional franchising business were 3,442 during the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 4,073 during the third quarter of 2023. Franchise royalties and fees during the first nine months of 2024 were 10,534 as compared to 12,456 during the first nine months of 2023. There were 116 Steak n Shake traditional units open on September 30, 2024, as compared to 134 units open on September 30, 2023. The decrease in franchise royalties and fees was primarily due to fewer traditional units open during 2024. 
 The cost of food at company-operated units during the third quarter of 2024 was 12,218 or 30.8 of net sales, as compared to 11,888 or 30.3 of net sales during the third quarter of 2023. The cost of food at company-operated units during the first nine months of 2024 was 35,549 or 29.8 of net sales, as compared to 34,038 or 29.4 of net sales during the first nine months of 2023. Cost of food expressed as a percentage of net sales remained relatively consistent. 
 
 Labor costs at company-operated restaurants during the third quarter of 2024 were 13,158 or 33.2 of net sales, as compared to 12,192 or 31.1 of net sales in the third quarter of 2023. Labor costs at company-operated restaurants during the first nine months of 2024 were 38,694 or 32.5 of net sales, as compared to 36,077 or 31.2 of net sales in 2023. Labor costs expressed as a percentage of net sales increased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in store level managers in Steak n Shake company-operated restaurants. 
 General and administrative expenses during the third quarter of 2024 were 10,355 or 16.6 of total revenue, as compared to 10,720 or 17.3 of total revenue in the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expenses during the first nine months of 2024 were 35,101 or 18.6 of total revenue, as compared to 31,973 or 17.1 of total revenue in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs at Steak n Shake. 
 The Company recorded no impairment charges in the third quarter of 2024 and 752 of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2023. The Company recorded impairment charges of 107 and 2,381 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to underperforming stores. 
 Interest on obligations under leases was 4,016 during 2024 versus 3,870 during 2023. 
 Other income was 4,420 during 2024 versus 5,126 during 2023. During 2024, Western Sizzlin received a settlement of 450. During 2024, Steak n Shake sold five properties for a gain of 4,383 and sold six properties for a gain of 5,253 during 2023.

 To better convey the performance of the franchise partnership model, the table below shows the underlying sales, cost of food, labor costs, and other restaurant costs of the franchise partners. We believe the franchise partner information is useful to readers, as they have a direct effect on Steak n Shake s profitability.

 The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include data in the table above. Figures are shown for information purposes only. 
 
 Insurance 
 We view our insurance businesses as possessing two activities: underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, whereas investing decisions are the responsibility of our Chairman and CEO, Sardar Biglari. Our business units are operated under separate local management. Biglari Holdings insurance operations consist of Biglari Reinsurance, First Guard, and Southern Pioneer. 
 Underwriting results of our insurance operations are summarized below. 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 2024 2023 Underwriting gain attributable to: First Guard 1,366 2,362 3,497 7,379 Southern Pioneer 912 (166) 186 (728) Pre-tax underwriting gain 2,278 2,196 3,683 6,651 Income tax expense 478 461 773 1,397 Net underwriting gain 1,800 1,735 2,910 5,254

 First Guard 
 
 First Guard is a direct underwriter of commercial truck insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking liability insurance to truckers. First Guard s insurance products are marketed primarily through direct response methods via the Internet or by telephone. First Guard s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods enable it to be a low-cost insurer. A summary of First Guard s underwriting results follows. 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount Amount Amount Amount Premiums written 9,394 9,351 28,198 27,465 Premiums earned 9,394 100.0 9,351 100.0 28,198 100.0 27,465 100.0 Insurance losses 6,003 63.9 5,268 56.3 18,939 67.2 14,766 53.8 Underwriting expenses 2,025 21.6 1,721 18.4 5,762 20.4 5,320 19.4 Total losses and expenses 8,028 85.5 6,989 74.7 24,701 87.6 20,086 73.2 Pre-tax underwriting gain 1,366 2,362 3,497 7,379 
 
 First Guard produced an underwriting gain in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Its underwriting profitability declined in 2024 as compared to 2023 because of a higher ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned. Our periodic underwriting earnings are subject to considerable volatility from significant weather-related loss events. It is the nature of the insurance business to experience volatility in underwriting performance.

 Premiums written increased 1,817 (9.0 in 2024 compared to 2023. Southern Pioneer s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 47.9 during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 60.5 during the third quarter of 2023 and 59.9 during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 59.6 during the first nine months of 2023. 
 A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows.

 Oil and Gas 
 A summary of revenues and earnings of our oil and gas operations follows. 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 2024 2023 Oil and gas revenues 9,574 12,159 27,755 35,123 Oil and gas production costs 4,425 3,771 13,206 12,754 Depreciation, depletion and accretion 3,402 2,404 8,072 8,155 Gain on sale of properties (54) (13,563) (16,700) (13,563) General and administrative expenses 1,089 594 3,648 3,831 Earnings before income taxes 712 18,953 19,529 23,946 Income tax expense (benefit) 113 4,322 4,412 5,495 Contribution to net earnings 599 14,631 15,117 18,451 
 Our oil and gas business is highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices. The lower natural gas prices and lower production during 2024 caused decreases in revenues. Production decreases were primarily because several gas wells were shut-in along with the natural depletion of oil and gas reserves. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, Abraxas Petroleum recorded a gain of 16,700 as a result of selling undeveloped reserves to an unaffiliated party whose aim is to conduct development activities; however, Abraxas Petroleum will not be required to fund any exploration expenditures on its undeveloped properties. During the third quarter of 2023, Abraxas Petroleum entered into a similar royalty-based arrangement on its undeveloped properties, which began producing in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Abraxas Petroleum 
 Abraxas Petroleum operates oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Earnings for Abraxas Petroleum are summarized below.

 Licensing revenue was lower during 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to fewer licensing events in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Investment Gains and Investment Partnership Gains 
 Investment gains net of tax for the third quarter of 2024 were 3,706 as compared to investment losses net of tax for the third quarter of 2023 of 3,710. Investment gains net of tax for the first nine months of 2024 were 2,879 as compared to investment losses net of tax for the first nine months of 2023 of 569. Dividends earned on investments are reported as investment income by our insurance companies. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. 
 Earnings (loss) from our investments in partnerships are summarized below. 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 2024 2023 Investment partnership gains (losses) 35,314 (89,599) (22,591) (24,507) Tax expense (benefit) 8,867 (21,222) (5,438) (6,660) Contribution to net earnings (loss) 26,447 (68,377) (17,153) (17,847) 
 Investment partnership gains include gains/losses from changes in market values of underlying investments and dividends earned by the partnerships. Dividend income has a lower effective tax rate than income from capital gains. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 The investment partnerships hold the Company s common stock as investments. The Company s pro-rata share of its common stock held by the investment partnerships is recorded as treasury stock even though these shares are legally outstanding. Gains and losses on Company common stock included in the earnings of the partnerships are eliminated in the Company s consolidated financial results. 
 Investment gains and losses in 2024 and 2023 were mainly derived from our investments in equity securities and included unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are generally meaningless for analytical purposes in understanding our quarterly and annual results. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 The Company s interest expense is summarized below. 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest expense on notes payable 275 262 317 469 Tax benefit 65 60 75 107 Interest expense net of tax 210 202 242 362 
 
 Biglari Holdings line of credit dated September 13, 2022 was amended on September 13, 2024 and the available line of credit was increased to an aggregate principal amount of up to 35,000. The balance of the line of credit was 9,000 on September 30, 2024. There was no balance on the line of credit on December 31, 2023. 
 
 Corporate and Other 
 Corporate expenses exclude the activities of the restaurant, insurance, brand licensing, and oil and gas businesses. Corporate and other net losses during the third quarter of 2024 increased as compared to the same period in 2023 because of higher legal and professional expenses. Corporate and other net losses during the first nine months of 2024 decreased as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower incentive fees accrued. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 11,201 compared to income tax benefit of 17,502 for the third quarter of 2023. Income tax expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 3,292 compared to income tax expense of 3,254 for the first nine months of 2023. The variance in income taxes between 2024 and 2023 is attributable to taxes on income generated by the investment partnerships. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Consolidated cash and investments are summarized below. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 29,891 28,066 Investments 102,902 91,879 Fair value of interest in investment partnerships 491,589 472,772 Total cash and investments 624,382 592,717 Less: portion of Company stock held by investment partnerships (289,998) (273,669) Carrying value of cash and investments on balance sheet 334,384 319,048

 Cash from operating activities decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily because of lower net earnings in restaurants and oil and gas of 3,583 and 3,334, respectively. 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased during 2024 by 21,310 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease in investments. 
 Cash from financing activities during 2024 was relatively consistent with 2023. 
 Biglari Holdings Line of Credit 
 Biglari Holdings line of credit dated September 13, 2022 was amended on September 13, 2024 and the available line of credit was increased to 35,000. The line of credit matures on September 13, 2026. The line of credit includes customary covenants, as well as financial maintenance covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. The balance of the line of credit was 9,000 on September 30, 2024. There was no balance on the line of credit on December 31, 2023. Our interest rate was 7.71 and 8.06 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is based on the 30-day Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 2.75 and 2.73 , respectively. 
 Western Sizzlin Revolver 
 Western Sizzlin s available line of credit is 500. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Western Sizzlin had no debt outstanding under its revolver. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. There have been no material changes to critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
