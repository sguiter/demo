SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Hayward Holdings, Inc. (the Company, we or us contains certain forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relating to us are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our strategies, plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, expenditures and assumptions and other statements contained in or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts. When used in this document, words such as may, will, should, could, intend, potential, continue, anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, plan, target, predict, project, seek and similar expressions as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our shareholders, and we therefore make forward-looking statements in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Act. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control, and actual results may differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. 
 Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding: our financial position; business plans and objectives; general economic and industry trends; business prospects; future product development and acquisition strategies; future channel stocking levels; growth and expansion opportunities; operating results; and working capital and liquidity. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We may not achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place significant reliance on our forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of forward-looking statements taken from third-party industry and market reports. 
 Important factors that could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements include the following: 
 our relationships with and the performance of distributors, builders, buying groups, retailers and servicers who sell our products to pool owners; 
 impacts on our business from the sensitivity of our business to seasonality and unfavorable economic and business conditions; 
 competition from national and global companies, as well as lower cost manufacturers; 
 our ability to develop, manufacture and effectively and profitably market and sell our new planned and future products; 
 our ability to execute on our growth strategies and expansion opportunities; 
 our exposure to credit risk on our accounts receivable; 
 impacts on our business from political, regulatory, economic, trade and other risks associated with operating foreign businesses, including risks associated with geopolitical conflict; 
 our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manage disruptions to our global supply chain and the availability of raw materials; 
 our ability to identify emerging technological and other trends in our target end markets; 
 failure of markets to accept new product introductions and enhancements; 
 the ability to successfully identify, finance, complete and integrate acquisitions; 
 our reliance on information technology systems and susceptibility to threats to those systems, including cybersecurity threats, and risks arising from our collection and use of personal information data; 
 regulatory changes and developments affecting our current and future products; 
 volatility in currency exchange rates and interest rates; 
 our ability to service our existing indebtedness and obtain additional capital to finance operations and our growth opportunities; 

our ability to establish, maintain and effectively enforce intellectual property protection for our products, as well as our ability to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others; 
 the impact of material cost and other inflation; 
 our ability to attract and retain senior management and other qualified personnel; 
 the impact of changes in laws, regulations and administrative policy, including those that limit U.S. tax benefits, impact trade agreements and tariffs, or address the impacts of climate change; 
 the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings; 
 the impact of product manufacturing disruptions, including as a result of catastrophic and other events beyond our businesses; 
 uncertainties related to distribution channel inventory practices and the impact on net sales volumes; 
 our ability to realize cost savings from restructuring activities; and 
 other factors set forth in the respective Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Many of these factors are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements may vary materially from those described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, planned or projected. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date of this report. Unless required by United States federal securities laws, we neither intend nor assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.

and ) , respectively, after discrete items. The change in the Company s effective tax rate was primarily due to the exercise of stock options, the release of the valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carryovers and return-to-provision adjustments in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was and , respectively. The change in the Company s effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefit from stock compensation and the release of the valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carryovers in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset with a change to the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion for one jurisdiction in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if the Company s assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term tax position refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. There were no uncertain tax positions at September 28, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Management evaluates the need for valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets according to the provisions of ASC 740,

Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amount of these instruments approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. 
 The Company s interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are measured in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values of these instruments are estimated using industry standard valuation models using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves. These instruments are customary, over-the-counter contracts with various bank counterparties. Accordingly, the fair value measurements of the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are categorized as Level 2. 
 The Company s investment plan assets as part of the nonqualified Hayward Industries Supplemental Retirement Plan (the Supplemental Retirement Plan are presented in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis and are based on quoted market prices in active markets.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical financial information, this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those set forth in the section Special Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent periods or the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 

Our Company 
 The Company is a leading global designer and manufacturer of pool and outdoor living technology. With the pool as the centerpiece of the growing outdoor living space, the pool industry has attractive market characteristics, including significant aftermarket requirements (such as the ongoing repair, replacement, remodeling and upgrading of equipment for existing pools), innovation-led growth opportunities, and a favorable industry structure. We are a leader in this market with a highly-recognized brand, one of the largest installed bases of pool equipment in the world, decades-long relationships with our key channel partners and trade customers and a history of technological innovation. Our engineered products, which include various energy efficient and more environmentally sustainable offerings, enhance the pool owner s outdoor living lifestyle while also delivering high quality water, pleasant ambiance and ease of use for the ultimate backyard experience. Aftermarket replacements and upgrades to higher value Internet of Things and energy efficient models are a primary growth driver for our business. 
 We have an estimated North American residential pool market share of approximately 34 . We believe that we are well-positioned for future growth. On average, we have 20+ year relationships with our top 20 customers. We estimate that historically aftermarket sales have represented approximately 80 of net sales and are generally recurring in nature since these products are critical to the ongoing operation of pools given requirements for water quality and sanitization. Our product replacement cycle of approximately 8 to 11 years drives multiple replacement opportunities over the typical life of a pool, creating opportunities to generate aftermarket product sales as pool owners repair, remodel and upgrade their pools. We estimate aftermarket sales based upon feedback from certain representative customers and management s interpretation of available industry and government data, and not upon our GAAP net sales results. 
 The Company has seven manufacturing facilities worldwide, which are located in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Rhode Island, Spain (two) and China, and other facilities in the United States, Canada, France and Australia. 

Segments 
 Our business is organized into two reportable segments: North America NAM and Europe Rest of World E RW ). The Company determined its reportable segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM reviews the Company s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. 
 The NAM segment manufactures and sells a complete line of residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and manufactures and sells flow control products. 
 The E RW segment manufactures and sells residential and commercial swimming pool equipment and supplies in Europe, Central and South America, the Middle East, Australia and other Asia Pacific countries. 
 NAM accounted for 86 and 84 of total net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and E RW accounted for 14 and 16 of total net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 NAM accounted for 84 and 82 of total net sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and E RW accounted for 16 and 18 of total net sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations 
 Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been affected by the following, among other events, which must be understood to assess the comparability of our period-to-period financial performance and condition. 
 Our fiscal quarters end on the Saturday closest to the calendar quarter end, with the exception of year end which ends on December 31 of each fiscal year. The interim closing date for the first, second and third quarters of 2024 are March 30, June 29, and September 28, compared to the respective April 1, July 1, and September 30, 2023 date. This resulted in no difference in working days for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the respective 2023 periods. Throughout this discussion we may refer to the three months ended September 28, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023 as the Third Quarter and Comparable Quarter, respectively. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is seasonal, with sales typically higher in the second and fourth quarters. During the second quarter, sales are higher in anticipation of the start of the summer pool season, and in the fourth quarter, we incentivize trade customers to buy and stock in preparation for next year s pool season under an Early Buy program, which features a price discount and extended payment terms. Shipments for the 2024 Early Buy program began in the late third quarter and will continue through approximately the first quarter of 2025. The favorable payment terms extended as part of the Early Buy program generally do not exceed 180 days. We aim to keep our manufacturing plants running at a constant level throughout the year and consequently we typically build inventory in the first and third quarters, and inventory is sold-down in the second and fourth quarters. Our accounts receivable balance increases from September to April as a result of the Early Buy extended terms. Also, because the majority of our sales are to distributors whose inventory of our products may vary, including due to reasons beyond our control, such as end-user demand, supply chain lead times and macroeconomic factors, our revenue may fluctuate from period to period. 
 Geopolitical Events 
 Geopolitical conflicts around the world have created substantial uncertainty in the global economy, including as a result of sanctions and penalties imposed in response to these conflicts. In particular, armed conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine and Russia have adversely affected market demand in the Middle East and Asia, which has negatively impacted our results in our E RW segment. See Segment Europe Rest of World E RW ), below. Given the nature of our business and global operations, if these or other geopolitical conflicts continue or worsen, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

Key Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Business 
 We consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business. The key GAAP measures we use are net sales, gross profit and gross profit margin, selling, general, and administrative expense SG A ), research, development, and engineering expense RD E ), operating income and operating income margin. The key non-GAAP measures we use are EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted segment income, and adjusted segment income margin. 
 
 For information about our use of Non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these metrics to the most relevant GAAP measure see Non-GAAP Reconciliation.

 Consolidated 
 The following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated. We derived the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The following table summarizes our results of operations:

Net sales 
 Net sales increased to 227.6 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 220.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.3 million, or 3.3 . See the segment discussion below for further information. 
 
 Net sales increased to 724.5 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 714.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 10.5 million, or 1.5 . See the segment discussion below for further information. 
 
 The year-over-year net sales increase was driven by the following: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 28, 2024 Volume (4.7) (2.0) Price, net of discounts and allowances 5.6 2.8 Acquisitions 2.5 0.8 Currency and other (0.1) (0.1) Total 3.3 1.5 
 The net sales increase for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 was driven by an increase in net price and the favorable impact from acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in volume. 
 23 

The net sales increase for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was driven by positive net price including normalized allowances and discounts and the positive impact from acquisitions, partially offset by reduced volumes. The decrease in volume resulted from market declines in the Middle East and Asia and lower new construction and remodel activity in the U.S.. 
 The net sales increase for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was driven by positive net price and the positive impact from acquisitions, partially offset by reduced volumes. The decrease in volume resulted from market declines in the Middle East and Asia and lower new construction and remodel activity in the U.S. 
 
 Gross profit and gross profit margin 
 Gross profit increased to 113.1 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 105.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.7 million, or 7.3 . 
 Gross profit margin increased to 49.7 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 47.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 190 basis points, driven by operational efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities and net price increases including normalized allowances and discounts, partially offset by a non-cash increase to cost of goods sold resulting from the fair value inventory step-up adjustment recognized as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of ChlorKing HoldCo, LLC and related entities ("ChlorKing") and a discrete inventory adjustment in Europe. 
 
 Gross profit increased to 362.8 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 339.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 23.0 million, or 6.8 . 
 Gross profit margin increased to 50.1 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 47.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 250 basis points, primarily due to operational efficiencies, net price increases and management of our manufacturing costs. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG A) increased to 64.5 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 59.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 5.0 million, or 8.5 , primarily due to higher salary costs driven by wage inflation and investments in our customer care and selling teams, discrete legal expenses, and increased professional service costs. 
 As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased to 28.3 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 27.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 130 basis points, driven by the factors discussed above. 
 
 SG A increased to 187.7 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 172.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 15.6 million, or 9.1 , driven by higher incentive compensation, higher salary costs driven by wage inflation and investments in our customer care and selling teams, discrete legal expenses, partially offset by decreased warranty costs. 
 As a percentage of net sales, SG A increased to 25.9 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to 24.1 for nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 180 basis points, due to the factors discussed above. 
 
 Research, development, and engineering expense 
 Research, development, and engineering expense (RD E) increased to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of timing of projects compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. RD E spend continues to be focused on new product development. 
 As a percentage of net sales, RD E was 2.8 for the three months ended September 28, 2024, which was unchanged compared to 2.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 RD E remained relatively consistent at 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared with 19.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, RD E was 2.6 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 2.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 10 basis points. 
 
 Acquisition and restructuring related expense 
 For the three months ended September 28, 2024, we incurred 1.1 million of acquisition and restructuring related expense as compared to 3.3 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The expense in the Third Quarter was primarily driven by costs associated with the acquisition of the ChlorKing business, compared to the Comparable Quarter 
 24 

which was primarily related to severance and retention costs associated with the centralization and consolidation of operations in Europe, along with the relocation of the corporate headquarters from New Jersey to North Carolina. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we incurred 2.5 million of acquisition and restructuring related expense as compared to 6.2 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 28, 2024 primarily included costs associated with the centralization and consolidation of operations in Europe and costs related to the acquisition of the ChlorKing business. The acquisition and restructuring related expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included severance and employee benefit costs as part of the corporate headquarters relocation and costs associated with the centralization and consolidation of operations in Europe. 
 See Note 16. Acquisitions and Restructuring. 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets 
 For the three months ended September 28, 2024, amortization of intangible assets increased by 0.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of ChlorKing. 
 For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, amortization of intangible assets decreased 1.4 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the amortization pattern of certain intangible asset classes based on the declining balance method. 
 
 Operating income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, operating income increased 4.5 million and 12.6 million, respectively, due to the aggregated effect of the items described above. 
 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net, decreased to 13.2 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net, for the three months ended September 28, 2024 consisted of 15.9 million of interest expense on the outstanding debt and 1.0 million of amortization of deferred financing fees, partially offset by 3.7 million of interest income on cash deposits. The effective interest rate on our borrowings, including the impact of an interest rate hedge, was 6.78 for the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Interest expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 19.2 million of interest expense on the outstanding debt and 1.2 million of amortization of deferred financing fees, partially offset by 3.0 million of interest income on cash deposits. The effective interest rate on our borrowings, including the impact of an interest rate hedge, was 7.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net, decreased by 4.2 million for the Third Quarter compared to the Comparable Quarter, primarily due to the repayment of the Incremental Term Loan B principal balance in April 2024 and higher interest income on cash investment balances. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, interest expense, net, decreased to 48.6 million from 55.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 consisted of 52.3 million of interest on the outstanding debt and 3.2 million of amortization of deferred financing fees, partially offset by 6.9 million of interest income. The effective interest rate on our borrowings, including the impact of an interest rate hedge, was 7.00 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Interest expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 56.5 million of interest on the outstanding debt and 3.5 million of amortization of deferred financing fees, partially offset by 4.1 million of interest income. The effective interest rate on our borrowings, including the impact of an interest rate hedge, was 7.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net, decreased by 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the repayment of the Incremental Term Loan B principal balance and interest income on cash investment balances. 
 25 

Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 The 4.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was incurred as a result of the voluntary repayment of the Incremental Term Loan B principal balance in April 2024. There was no loss on extinguishment of debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 We incurred income tax expense of 4.4 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.7 million, or 295.3 . 
 The increase in the Company s effective tax rate from (23.7) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 21.1 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to the exercise of stock options, the release of the valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carryovers and return-to-provision adjustments during the Comparable Quarter. 
 
 We incurred income tax expense of 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.5 million, or 36.4 . 
 The increase in the Company s effective tax rate from 19.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.9 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefit from stock compensation and the release of the valuation allowance against foreign tax credit carryovers in the prior year period, partially offset with the change to the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion for one jurisdiction in the prior-year period. 
 
 Net income and net income margin 
 As a result of the foregoing, net income increased 4.7 million and 14.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively. 
 Net income margin increased to 7.3 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 5.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 190 basis points. 
 
 Net income margin increased to 8.8 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 7.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 180 basis points. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased to 51.1 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 47.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.9 million, or 8.2 , driven primarily by increased net sales and higher gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG A expense. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 22.5 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 21.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 110 basis points. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased to 178.7 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 171.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.1 million or 4.2 , driven primarily by increased net sales and higher gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG A expense. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 24.7 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 24.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 70 basis points, due to the factors described above. 
 See Non-GAAP Reconciliation for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP metric. 

26 

Segment 
 The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company s reportable segments consist of NAM and E RW. We evaluate performance based on net sales, gross profit, segment income and adjusted segment income, and we use gross profit margin, segment income margin and adjusted segment income margin as comparable performance measures for our reporting segments. 
 Segment income represents segment net sales less cost of sales, segment SG A and RD E, excluding acquisition and restructuring related expense as well as amortization of intangible assets. A reconciliation of segment income to our operating income is detailed below. Adjusted segment income represents segment income adjusted for the impact of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets recorded within cost of sales, stock-based compensation and certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items that are included in segment income that we do not consider indicative of the ongoing segment operating performance.

 Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
 The Company uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. These metrics are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, when considered alongside other GAAP measures. 
 EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest (including amortization of debt costs), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of restructuring related income or expenses, stock-based compensation, currency exchange items, and certain non-cash, nonrecurring, or other items that are included in net income and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted segment income is defined as segment income adjusted for the impact of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets recorded within cost of sales, stock-based compensation and certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items that are included in segment income that we do not consider indicative of the ongoing segment operating performance. Adjusted segment income margin is defined as adjusted segment income divided by segment net sales. 
 EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin are not recognized measures of financial performance under GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide analysts, investors and other interested parties with additional insight into the underlying trends of our business and assist these parties in analyzing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, which allows for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to understand and compare operating results across reporting periods for various purposes including internal budgeting and forecasting, short and long-term operating planning, employee incentive compensation, and debt compliance. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. 
 EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, and accordingly, are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted segment income should not be construed as indicators of a company s operating performance in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income (loss) and segment income which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have presented EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted segment income and adjusted segment income margin solely as supplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations. In the future we may incur expenses such as those added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted segment income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility ABL Facility ). 
 Primary working capital requirements are for raw materials, component and certain finished goods inventories and supplies, payroll, manufacturing, freight and distribution, facility, and other operating expenses. Cash flow from operations and working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, driven primarily by the seasonal demand for our products, an Early Buy program, the timing of inventory purchases and receipt of customer payments, and as such, the utilization of the ABL Facility fluctuates during the year. 
 Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 274.2 million as of September 28, 2024 , which is an increase of 96.1 million from 178.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 32 

We focus on increasing cash flow, solidifying the liquidity position through working capital initiatives, and paying our debt obligations, while continuing to fund business growth initiatives and return of capital to shareholders. We believe that net cash provided by operating activities and availability under the ABL Facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, inclusive of capital expenditures, and debt service over the next 12 months. 
 Accounts Receivable Sales 
 On July 3, 2024, we entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement under which we may offer to sell eligible accounts receivable. The agreement is uncommitted and t he eligible accounts receivable to be sold under the agreement consist of up to 125 million in accounts receivable generated by sales to specified customers of the Company. The Company will be paid a discounted purchase price for each receivable sold. The discount rate used to determine the purchase price for the subject receivables is based upon an annual interest rate equal to the forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate for the period of time between payment to the Company and the due date for the receivable plus a buffer period specific to the obligor, plus a margin applicable to the specified obligor. 
 Transactions under this agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, and the receivables sold are removed from the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at the time of the sales transaction. For ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the receivables sold and remits those payments to the purchaser. Proceeds received from the sales of accounts receivable are classified as operating cash flows and collections of previously sold accounts receivable not yet submitted to the financial institution are classified as financing cash flows in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We record the discount in the Other expense, net line in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended September 28, 2024 , there were immaterial proceeds from the sale of receivables under the Receivables Purchase Agreement. 
 Credit Facilities 
 The First Lien Term Facility and ABL Facility (collectively Credit Facilities contain various restrictions, covenants and collateral requirements. Refer to Note 7. Long-Term Debt of notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the terms of the Credit Facilities. We also have a revolving credit facility for our Spain subsidiary in the amount of 0.5 million as a local source of liquidity.

ABL Facility 
 The ABL Facility provides for an aggregate amount of borrowings up to 425.0 million, with a peak season commitment of 475.0 million, subject to a borrowing base calculation based on available eligible receivables, eligible inventory, and qualified cash in North America. Accounts receivable for customers whose receivables are eligible for purchase under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, regardless of whether any amount of outstanding accounts receivable with those specific customers have been sold under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, are not eligible accounts receivable under the ABL Facility. An amount of up to 30 (or up to 40 with agent consent) of the then-outstanding commitments under the ABL Facility is available to our Canada and Spain subsidiaries. A portion of the ABL Facility not to exceed 50 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit in U.S. Dollars, of which 20.0 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit in Canadian dollars. The ABL Facility also includes a 50.0 million swingline loan facility and a 21.9 million First-In, Last-Out Sublimit FILO Sublimit ). The maturity of the facility is June 1, 2026. 
 On June 26, 2024, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to its existing ABL Revolving Credit Facility (the ABL Facility to replace the Canadian reference rate from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate CDOR to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA ). 
 The borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate Term SOFR plus a 0.10 credit spread adjustment and a margin of between 1.25 to 1.75 , or at a base rate plus a margin of 0.25 to 0.75 with no credit spread adjustment, while the FILO Sublimit borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR or a base rate plus a margin of between 2.25 to 2.75 or 1.25 to 1.75 , respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 28, 2024, the average borrowing base under the ABL Facility was 109.2 million and the average loan balance outstanding was zero. As of September 28, 2024, the loan balance was zero with a borrowing availability of 113.7 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the average borrowing base under the ABL Facility was 237.4 million and the average loan balance outstanding was zero. 
 First Lien Term Facilities 
 On May 22, 2023, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Company's First Lien Credit Agreement (the First Lien Term Facility and, together with the ABL Facility, the Credit Facilities to replace the LIBOR based reference rate with an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The First Lien Term Facility bears interest at a rate equal to a base rate or SOFR, plus, in either case, an applicable margin. In the case of SOFR tranches, the applicable margin is 2.75 per annum with a 0.50 floor, with a stepdown to 2.50 per annum with a 0.50 floor when net secured leverage as defined by the First Lien Credit Agreement is less than 2.5x. The loan under the First Lien Term Facility amortizes quarterly at a rate of 0.25 of the original principal amount and requires a 2.5 million repayment of principal on the last business day of each March, June, September and December. For a portion of the Comparable Quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the borrowings under the First Lien Term Facility bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 per annum with a 0.50 floor, with a stepdown to 2.50 per annum with a 0.50 floor when net secured leverage ratio is less than 2.5x. 
 The First Lien Term Facility also included an incremental term loan in an aggregate original principal amount of 125 million (the Incremental Term Loan B ). The Incremental Term Loan B bore interest at an annual floating rate based on a forward-looking rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (with a 0.50 floor) plus 3.25 and a 0.10 credit spread adjustment. In April 2024, t he Company used 123.1 million of cash on hand to fund voluntary principal prepayments of the Incremental Term Loan B. As a result of these prepayments, the Company had zero aggregate principal outstanding on the Incremental Term Loan B as of September 28, 2024. 
 Under the agreement governing the First Lien Credit Facility (the First Lien Credit Agreement ), the Company must make an annual mandatory prepayment of principal for between 0 and 50 of the excess cash and subject to permitted deductions, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, generated in the prior calendar year. The amount due varies with the First Lien Leverage Ratio as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, from zero if the First Lien Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 2.5x, to fifty percent if the First Lien Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.0x, in each case as of December 31 of the prior year. The First Lien Term Facility matures on May 28, 2028. 
 As of September 28, 2024, the balance outstanding under the First Lien Term Facility was 970.0 million . 
 For the three months ended September 28, 2024, t he effective interest rate on borrowings under the First Lien Term Facility, including the impact of an interest rate hedge, was 6.51 . The effective interest rate is comprised of 8.01 for interest and 0.29 for financing costs, partially offset by 1.78 for interest income on the interest rate swaps. 
 34 

For the nine months ended September 28, 2024 , the effective interest rate on borrowings under the First Lien Term Facility, including the impact of an interest rate hedge, was 6.76 . The effective interest rate is comprised of 8.10 for interest and 0.34 for financing costs, partially offset by 1.68 for interest income on the interest rate swaps. 
 Covenant Compliance 
 The Credit Facilities contain various restrictions, covenants and collateral requirements. As of September 28, 2024 , we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: 
 (Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 275,762 216,937 Net cash used in investing activities (53,877) (22,610) Net cash used in financing activities (125,848) (5,198) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 50 (1,061) Change in cash and cash equivalents 96,087 188,068 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased to 275.8 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 216.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 58.9 million, or 27.1 . The increase in cash provided was primarily driven by greater cash generated by working capital compared to the prior-year period and due to an increase in net income. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 53.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 22.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a change of 31.3 million, or 138.3 . The increase in cash used in investing activities is driven by the acquisition of the ChlorKing business, partially offset by the proceeds of certificates of deposit investments. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 125.8 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a change of 120.6 million, or 2321.1 . The increase in cash used was primarily driven by the prepayment of the Incremental Term Loan B. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We had 4.3 million of outstanding letters of credit on our ABL Revolving Credit Facility as of each of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in Part II, Item 7, under the heading Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our Annual Report on Form 10-K ), which section is incorporated herein by reference, and remain unchanged through the first nine months of 2024. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies of notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 35 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. Periodically, we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. 
 There have been no material changes in the interest rate risk during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from what we reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 For a discussion of our Legal Proceedings, refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies of notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which discussion is incorporated by reference herein. 
 In addition to the matters discussed in this report and in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, other litigation and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings could relate to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers, customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures, intellectual property matters, product liability, the use or installation of our products, consumer matters, employment and labor matters, and environmental, safety and health matters, including claims based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing product components. We believe that the outcome of such other litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 On August 2, 2023, a securities class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain of its current directors and officers (Kevin Holleran and Eifion Jones) and MSD Partners and CCMP Capital Advisors, LP on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who acquired shares of our common stock between March 2, 2022 and July 27, 2022. That action is captioned City of Southfield Fire and Police Retirement System vs. Hayward Holdings, Inc., et al. , 2:23-cv-04146-WJM-ESK (D.N.J.) City of Southfield ). On September 28, 2023, a second, related securities class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain of its current directors and officers (Kevin Holleran and Eifion Jones) and MSD Partners and CCMP Capital Advisors, LP on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who acquired shares of our common stock between October 27, 2021 and July 28, 2022. That action is captioned Erie County Employees Retirement System vs. Hayward Holdings, Inc., et al. , 2:23-cv-04146-WJM-ESK (D.N.J.) Erie County ). On December 19, 2023, the Court issued a ruling consolidating the two securities class actions (City of Southfield and Erie County) under the City of Southfield docket (the Securities Class Action and appointing a lead plaintiff. In a consolidated class action complaint filed March 4, 2024, the Securities Class Action alleged on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who acquired shares of our common stock between October 27, 2021 and July 28, 2022, among other things, that the Company and certain of its current directors and officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, making materially false or misleading statements regarding inventory, growth, and demand trends and the Company s financial projections for 2022. The Securities Class Action seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative classes and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees. On October 2, 2024, the Court issued an Opinion and Order dismissing the consolidated class action complaint and granted the lead plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint within 30 days. 
 On November 27, 2023, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against current and past officers and directors of the Company captioned Heicklen v. Holleran , et al., 2:23-cv-22649 (D.N.J.) (the Derivative Action ). The Derivative Action alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Company stockholders, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, corporate waste, and violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the claims in the Securities Class Action. The Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws and pre-existing agreements between the Company and these current and former directors provide for the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless any action, suit or proceeding any person, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director of the Company, against all liability and loss suffered. The Derivative Action seeks recovery of unspecified damages and attorney s fees and costs, as well as improvements to the Company s corporate governance and internal procedures. The Derivative Action has been stayed pending final decision on a motion to dismiss being filed in the Securities Class Action. 
 We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing in the Securities Class Action and the Derivative Action and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. In view of the complexity and ongoing and uncertain nature of the outstanding proceedings and inquiries, at this time we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible financial loss or range of financial loss, if any, that we may incur to resolve or settle the Securities Class Action and the Derivative Action.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in our common stock involves risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business please refer to the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We rely on information technology systems to support our business operations. A significant disturbance or breach of our technological infrastructure, or those of our vendors or others with which we do business, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, failure to maintain the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation. 
 We rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties, whose products, services and systems are beyond our control. We expect our reliance on information technology systems to increase as we continue to develop IoT-enabled products, such as our Omni mobile app, and implement new technologies to facilitate our operations, such as our ERP system and human resources information system, which are in the process of being implemented. As a result, our ability to operate effectively on a day-to-day basis and accurately report our results depends on a reliable technological infrastructure, which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats, including malicious code embedded in open-source software, or misconfigurations, bugs or other vulnerabilities in commercial software that is integrated into our (or our suppliers or service providers information technology systems and networks, products or services. We are vulnerable to interruption and breakdown by system downtime or failure, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunication failures, internet failures, security breaches and other catastrophic events. 
 We are subject to known and unknown vulnerabilities in our software and systems and those of third parties. We and certain of our third-party service providers have in the past experienced, and we expect in the future will continue to experience, cybersecurity attacks and other incidents that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information technology systems and networks and confidential information, including personal information, that we or third parties collect, maintain and/or process. We periodically evaluate and test the adequacy of our systems, measures, controls and procedures and perform third-party risk assessments. However, such threats have increased in frequency, scope, and potential impact in recent years. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until after they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We prioritize the remediation of identified security vulnerabilities based on known and anticipated risks, and we aim to patch vulnerabilities within reasonable timeframes. However, we are unable to comprehensively identify all vulnerabilities (particularly as related to third-party software and systems), apply patches or confirm that mitigating measures are in place, or ensure that any patches will be applied by us or third parties before exploitation by a threat actor. If attackers are able to exploit vulnerabilities before patches are installed or mitigating measures are implemented, significant compromises could impact our systems and data. 
 The development of artificial intelligence technologies may exacerbate these cybersecurity risks and pose new or unknown cybersecurity risks and challenges. As a result, we may be unable to detect, investigate, remediate or recover from future attacks or incidents, or to avoid a material adverse impact to our information technology systems and networks, confidential information or business. The accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of our vendors and/or others with which we do business, or the existence of computer viruses, such as ransomware or other malware, in our or their data or software, and/or any other failure of our or their information technology systems could expose us to a risk of information loss, the misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, work stoppages, reputational damage, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, regulatory fines or penalties, litigation by affected parties, possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of this information and/or the defective manufacture or defective design of our products, which could expose us to liability, and/or significant incident response, system restoration or remediation and future compliance costs. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cybersecurity incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation that may result from an incident. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our information technology systems and confidential information. 
 38 

Establishing and maintaining systems and processes to address these threats may increase our costs and may be mandated by regulation. For example, the California Internet of Things Security Law, which became effective in 2020, requires us to implement reasonable security measures for IoT devices, and failure to do so could expose us to penalties. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 The Company had no repurchases of its common stock, par value 0.001 per share, in the quarter ended September 28, 2024. On July 26, 2022, the Board of Directors renewed the initial authorization of its share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program such that the Company is authorized, commencing at that time, to repurchase from time to time up to an aggregate of 450.0 million of its common stock with such authority expiring on July 26, 2025. 
 Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company may purchase shares of its common stock on a discretionary basis from time to time and may be conducted through privately negotiated transactions, including with our significant stockholders, as well as through open market repurchases or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1(c) trading plans or through the use of other techniques such as accelerated share repurchases. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing and other investing activities. 
 As of September 28, 2024, 400.0 million remained available under the current authorization for additional share repurchases. The Company did not make purchases of its common stock under the Share Repurchase Program for the three months ended September 28, 2024.
