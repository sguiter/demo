 Overview 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on Alamo Group s current expectations. Actual results in future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed below and in the Forward-Looking Information section. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the "Company", "we", "our" and "us" means Alamo Group Inc. 
 
 We experienced strong demand for industrial equipment during the first nine months of 2024 while demand for forestry, tree care, and agricultural mowing products has weakened as was reflected in our sales growth. Gross profit margins declined slightly due to weaker Vegetation Management Division sales that slowed our production cadence and adversely impacted production efficiency. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, the Company's net sales decreased by 2 and net income decreased by 16 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by weakened product demand in the Vegetation Management Division. Additionally, the sale of Herschel Parts on August 16, 2024 had a negative impact to year-on-year sales, albeit immaterial on a year-to-date basis. These challenges were nearly offset by strong sales growth in the Industrial Equipment Division. The decrease in net income was largely driven by the decrease in Vegetation Management product demand, which impacted production efficiency, and the 
 16 

associated separation costs to reduce division capacity. Additionally, nonrecurring costs associated with the labor strike at Gradall Industries negatively impacted the Industrial Equipment Division in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 The Company's Vegetation Management Division experienced an 18 decrease in sales for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 that was driven by steep decline in the forestry, tree care and agricultural mowing markets. The Division's backlog has declined 52 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by softness in incoming forestry and agricultural mowing orders. As a result, the Division's income from operations for the first nine months of 2024 declined 51 versus the same period in 2023. The Company is executing cost savings initiatives aimed to adjust to the market conditions and improve operational efficiency. 
 
 The Company's Industrial Equipment Division sales increased in the first nine months of 2024 by 22 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. Industrial Equipment sales were strong in all product lines with excavators, vacuum trucks, sweepers safety, and snow removal contributing to year over year growth. The Division's income from operations for the first nine months of 2024 was up 58 versus the same period in 2023, due to the increased demand combined with a significant improvement in supply chain performance and truck chassis availability. 
 
 Consolidated income from operations was 130.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 153.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 15 . The Company's backlog of 728.8 million at the end of the first nine months of 2024 is down 18 versus a backlog of 890.9 million at the end of the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 While the supply chain performance has broadly improved, we continue to experience shortages of certain components that could impact performance. In addition, the Company may also be negatively affected by several other factors such as weakness in the overall U.S. or world-wide economy, further increases in interest rates, savings related to cost saving actions being diminished by declining revenue, changes in tariff regulations and the imposition of new tariffs, ongoing trade disputes, a deterioration of our supply chain, changes in U.S. fiscal policy such as changes in the federal tax rate, significant changes in currency exchange rates, negative economic impacts resulting from geopolitical events such as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, changes in trade policy, increased levels of government regulations, weakness in the agricultural sector, acquisition integration issues, budget constraints or revenue shortfalls in governmental entities, and other risks and uncertainties as described in the Risk Factors" section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). 

Results of Operations 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 401.3 million, a decrease of 18.3 million or 4 compared to 419.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Net sales during the third quarter of 2024 declined due to weaker market demand in forestry, tree care, and agricultural mowing partially offset by continued strong demand for Industrial Equipment. 
 
 Net Vegetation Management sales decreased by 56.8 million or 23 to 190.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 246.9 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to sustained weakness in forestry, tree care, and agricultural mowing markets. The sale of Herschel Parts on August 16, 2024 was immaterial to the year over year sales decrease. 
 
 Net Industrial Equipment sales were 211.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 172.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 38.5 million or 22 . The increase was due to solid results in all product lines, particularly sweepers safety, vacuum trucks, and snow contributing the most to year over year growth. 
 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 100.9 million (25 of net sales) compared to 114.1 million (27 of net sales) during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 13.2 million. The decrease in gross profit during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to the decline in Vegetation Management market demand. Profitability in the quarter also decreased due to production inefficiencies, under- 
 17 

absorption, and the impact of continued separation costs to reduce capacity in Vegetation Management. Cost savings actions taken in the second quarter 2024 were offset by continued revenue decline. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A were 56.7 million (14 of net sales) during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 60.6 million (14 of net sales) during the same period of 2023, a decrease of 3.9 million. The decrease in SG A expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is attributable to labor cost savings actions taken in Vegetation Management partially offset by additional cost from the Royal Truck acquisition. Labor cost inflation has been more than offset by cost savings actions. Amortization expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 4.1 million compared to 3.8 million in the same period in 2023, an increase due to the Royal Truck acquisition. 
 
 Interest expense was 4.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6.7 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was mainly due to debt reduction and slightly lower interest rates compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Other income (expense), net was less than 0.1 million of expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.1 million of income during the same period in 2023. The decline was primarily a result of unfavorable currency exchange rates in the third quarter of 2024 nearly offset by the gain on sale of Herschel Parts. 
 
 Provision for income taxes was 8.3 million (23 of income before income tax) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 8.6 million (20 of income before income tax) during the same period in 2023. The increase in tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was largely a result of a return to provision adjustment driven by higher research and development and foreign tax credits recognized in the same period in 2023. 
 
 The Company s net income after tax was 27.4 million or 2.28 per share on a diluted basis for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 34.9 million or 2.91 per share on a diluted basis for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease of 7.5 million resulted from the factors described above. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 were 1,243.2 million, a decrease of 28.9 million or 2 compared to 1,272.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net sales during the first nine months of 2024 is a result of steep decline in market demand in forestry, tree care, and agricultural mowing partially offset by continued strong demand for Industrial Equipment. 
 
 Net Vegetation Management sales decreased during the first nine months by 139.3 million or 18 to 625.4 million for 2024 compared to 764.7 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to weaker demand for forestry, tree care, and agricultural mowing markets. The sale of Herschel Parts on August 16, 2024 was immaterial to the year over year sales decrease. 
 
 Net Industrial Equipment sales were 617.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 507.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 110.4 million or 22 . The increase in sales for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was mainly due to the continued strong demand across the division in excavators, vacuum trucks, sweepers safety, and snow removal. 
 
 Gross profit for the first nine months of 2024 was 320.7 million (26 of net sales) compared to 344.7 million (27 of net sales) during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 24.0 million. The decrease in gross profit was mainly attributable to lower sales volume and production inefficiencies in Vegetation Management. Profitability in the first nine months of 2024 also decreased due to the five-week strike at Gradall in Ohio, which negatively affected the Industrial Equipment Division, and separation costs incurred in the Vegetation Management Division. Cost savings actions taken in the second quarter 2024 were offset by continued revenue decline. 
 
 SG A expenses were 178.2 million (14 of net sales) during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 180.1 million (14 of net sales) during the same period of 2023, a decrease of 1.9 million. The decrease in SG A expense in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 is attributable to labor cost savings actions taken in Vegetation Management partially offset by additional cost from the Royal Truck acquisition. Labor cost inflation has been offset by cost savings actions. Amortization expense in the first nine months of 2024 was 12.2 million compared to 11.5 million in the same period in 2023, an increase of 0.7 million.

Interest expense was 17.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 19.5 million during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 2.4 million. The decrease in interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to debt reduction. 
 
 Other income (expense), net was less than 0.1 million of income during the first nine months of 2024 compared to less than 0.1 million of income in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Provision for income taxes was 27.3 million (24 of income before income taxes) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 30.2 million (22 of income before income taxes) during the same period in 2023. The increase in tax rate for 2024 was largely a result of a return to provision adjustment driven by higher research and development and foreign tax credits recognized in 2023. 
 
 The Company's net income after tax was 87.8 million or 7.30 per share on a diluted basis for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 104.6 million or 8.73 per share on a diluted basis for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease of 16.8 million resulted from the factors described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company has ongoing cash requirements which are necessary to operate the business, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. The Company s accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable levels, particularly in its Vegetation Management Division, build in the first quarter and early spring and, to a lesser extent, in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the spring and fall selling seasons. Accounts receivable historically build in the first and fourth quarters of each year as a result of pre-season sales and year-round sales programs. These sales, primarily in the Vegetation Management Division, help balance the Company s production during the first and fourth quarters. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 667.6 million which represents an increase of 77.6 million from working capital of 590.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital was primarily a result of cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Capital expenditures were 19.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 27.1 million during the first nine months of 2023. The Company expects a capital expenditure level of approximately 30.0 million to 35.0 million for the full year of 2024. The Company will fund any future expenditures from operating cash flows or through our revolving credit facility, described below. 
 Ne t cash used for investing activities was 16.1 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 24.0 million during the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 25.4 million and net cash provided by financing activities was 14.3 million during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Lower net cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 relates to increased repayments on the Company's credit facility. 
 
 The Company had 130.8 million in cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024. The majority of these funds are at our European and Canadian facilities. The Company will continue to repatriate European and Canadian cash and cash equivalents in excess of amounts needed to fund operating and investing activities in these locations, and will monitor exchange rates to determine the appropriate timing of such repatriation given the current relative value of the U.S. dollar. Repatriated funds will initially be used to reduce funded debt levels under the Company's current credit facility and subsequently used to fund working capital, capital investments and acquisitions company-wide. 
 
 On October 28, 2022, the Company, as Borrower, and each of its domestic subsidiaries as guarantors, entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides Borrower with the ability to request loans and other financial obligations in an aggregate amount of up to 655.0 million. Under the 2022 Credit Agreement, the Company has borrowed 255.0 million pursuant to a Term Facility, while up to 400.0 million is available to the Company pursuant to a Revolver Facility which terminates in 2027. The Term Facility requires the Company to make equal quarterly principal payments of 3.75 million over the term of the loan, with the final payment of any outstanding principal amount, plus interest, due at the end of the five year term. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company s option, at a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or a Base Rate (each as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable 
 19 

margin ranges from 1.25 to 2.50 for Term SOFR borrowings and from .25 to 1.50 for Base Rate borrowings with the margin percentage based upon the Company's consolidated leverage ratio. The Company must also pay a commitment fee to the lenders ranging between 0.15 to 0.30 on any unused portion of the 400.0 million Revolver Facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain two financial covenants, namely, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. The Agreement also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, limitations on investments and acquisitions, limitations on the sale of properties and limitations on liens and capital expenditures. The Agreement also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of defaults. The expiration date of the 2022 Credit Agreement, including the Term Facility and the Revolver Facility, is October 28, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, 225.0 million was outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement, 225.0 million on the Term Facility and zero on the Revolver Facility. On September 30, 2024, 2.6 million of the revolver capacity was committed to irrevocable standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as required by vendors' contracts resulting in 397.4 million in available borrowings. The Company is in compliance with the covenants under the Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Management believes the 2022 Credit Agreement along with the Company s ability to internally generate funds from operations should be sufficient to allow the Company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future. However, future challenges affecting the banking industry and credit markets in general could potentially cause changes to credit availability, which creates a level of uncertainty. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe our financial position remains robust, supported by a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow from operations. Our available liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents, along with access to undrawn credit facilities, ensures that we are well equipped to meet our operating needs and explore strategic initiatives that could enhance shareholder value. We continuously evaluate our capital allocation strategy, including implementing a share repurchase program if it aligns with our strategic priorities and is deemed to be in the best interest of our shareholders. We believe that repurchasing our shares would be a prudent use of capital, provided appropriate market conditions. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that of the Company's significant accounting policies, which are set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K, the policies relating to the business combinations involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. There have been no material changes to the nature of estimates, assumptions and levels of subjectivity and judgment related to critical accounting estimates disclosed in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition. 
 
 20 

Forward-Looking Information 
 
 Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, forward-looking statements may be made orally or in press releases, conferences, reports or otherwise, in the future by or on behalf of the Company. Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent the Company's and its management's belief regarding future events. 
 
 Statements that are not historical are forward-looking. When used by us or on our behalf, the words "expect," 
 will, estimate, believe, intend, "would," could, "predict," should, anticipate, "continue," project, forecast, 
 plan, may and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. 
 Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These uncertainties include factors that affect all 
 businesses operating in a global market, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets we serve. 
 Certain particular risks and uncertainties that continually face us include the following: 
 
 budget constraints and revenue shortfalls which could affect the purchases of our type of equipment by governmental customers and related contractors in both domestic and international markets; 
 market acceptance of new and existing products; 
 our ability to hire suitable employees for our business and maintain good relations with employees; 
 our ability to develop and manufacture new and existing products profitably; 
 the inability of our suppliers, creditors, public utility providers and financial and other service organizations to deliver or provide their products or services to us; 
 legal actions and litigation; 
 impairment in the carrying value of goodwill; 
 our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and operate acquired businesses or assets; 
 current and changing tax laws in the U.S. and internationally; 
 our ability to hire and retain quality skilled employees; and 
 changes in the prices of agricultural commodities, which could affect our customers income levels. 
 
 In addition, we are subject to risks and uncertainties facing the industry in general, including the following: 
 
 changes in business and political conditions and the economy in general in both domestic and international markets; 
 uncertainty due to future direction of federal fiscal policy following national elections may slow the growth in governmental market revenue; 
 the price and availability of energy and critical raw materials, particularly steel and steel products; 
 increased competition; 
 increases in input costs on items we use in the manufacturing of our products; 
 adverse weather conditions such as droughts, floods, snowstorms, etc., which can affect the buying patterns of our customers and end-users; 
 increased costs of complying with governmental regulations which affect corporations including related fines and penalties (such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act); 
 an increase in unfunded pension plan liability due to financial market deterioration; 
 the potential effects on the buying habits of our customers due to animal disease outbreaks and other epidemics; 
 adverse market conditions and credit constraints which could affect our customers and end-users, such as cutbacks on dealer stocking levels; 
 changes in market demand; 
 climate related incidents and other sustainability risks, global pandemics, acts of war or aggression and terrorist activities or military actions; 
 cyber security risks including the potential loss of proprietary data or data security breaches and related fines, penalties and other liabilities; 
 financial market changes including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; 
 abnormal seasonal factors in our industry; 
 21 

changes in domestic and foreign governmental policies and laws, including increased levels of government regulation and changes in agricultural policies, including the amount of farm subsidies and farm payments as well as changes in trade policy that may have an adverse impact on our business; 
 government actions, including but not limited to budget levels, and changes in tax laws, regulations and legislation, relating to the environment, commerce, infrastructure spending, health and safety; and 
 risk of governmental defaults and resulting impact on the global economy and particularly financial institutions. 
 
 The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and to recognize that the statements are not predictions of actual future results. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties 
 described above, as well as others not now anticipated. The foregoing statements are not exclusive and further information concerning us and our businesses, including factors that could potentially materially affect our financial results, may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for management to predict all risk factors or to assess the impact of such risk factors on the Company s businesses. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company speak only to the date they are made and we do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the forward-looking statements were made. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
 
 The Company is exposed to various market risks. Market risks are the potential losses arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 International Sales 
 
 A portion of the Company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions. The Company primarily manufactures its products in the U.S., U.K., France, Canada, Brazil, and the Netherlands. The Company sells its products primarily in the functional currency within the markets where the products are produced, but certain sales from the Company's U.K. and Canadian operations are denominated in other foreign currencies. As a result, the Company s financials, specifically the value of its foreign assets, could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the Company distribute their products. 
 
 Exposure to Exchange Rates 
 
 The Company translates the assets and liabilities of foreign-owned subsidiaries at rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the reporting period. Translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity. The total foreign currency translation adjustment for the current quarter increased stockholders equity by 13.8 million. 
 
 The Company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominately in Europe and Canada, as a result of the sales of its products in international markets. Forward currency contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations. The result of a uniform 10 strengthening or 10 decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the Company s sales are denominated would result in a change in gross profit of 10.0 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. A stronger U.S. dollar would unfavorably impact gross profit while a weaker U.S. dollar would provide a favorable impact to gross profit. This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, which include a changed dollar value of the resulting sales, changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive. The Company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices. 
 
 22 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company s long-term debt bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, the Company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates. Assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point change for the third quarter 2024 average interest rate under these borrowings, the Company s interest expense would have changed by approximately 1.1 million. To protect the Company's long-term debt from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps to mitigate exposure. However, this analysis assumes no such actions. Further this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Alamo s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), and Vice President Chief Accounting Officer (Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon the evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), and Vice President Chief Accounting Officer (Principal Accounting Officer), concluded that the Company s design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of the period covered by this report. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
