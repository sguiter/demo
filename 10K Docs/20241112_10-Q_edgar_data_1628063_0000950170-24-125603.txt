SERITAGE GROWTH PROPERTIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLI DATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) properties comprised of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area GLA or build-to-suit leased area, and acres of land. The portfolio consists of approximately million square feet of GLA and acres held by consolidated properties (such properties, the Consolidated Properties and million square feet of GLA and acres held by nine unconsolidated properties (such properties, the Unconsolidated Properties ). The Company commenced operations on July 7, 2015, following a rights offering to the shareholders of Sears Holdings Corporation Sears Holdings or Sears to purchase common shares of Seritage in order to fund, in part, the billion acquisition of certain of Sears Holdings owned properties and its interests in joint ventures which were simultaneously leased back to Sears Holdings under a master lease agreement (the Original Master Lease and the Original JV Master Leases, respectively). As of March 15, 2021, the Company no longer had any remaining properties leased to Transform Holdco LLC Holdco ), an affiliate of ESL Investments, Inc. or Sears Holdings. On March 1, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Trustees had commenced a process to review a broad range of strategic alternatives. The Board of Trustees created a Special Committee (the Special Committee of the Company s Board of Trustees to oversee the process. The Special Committee retained Barclays as its financial advisor. The agreement with Barclays expired in August 2023. The Company s strategic review process remains ongoing as the Company executes sales pursuant to the Plan of Sale. The Company remains open minded to pursuing value maximizing alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. There can be no assurance that the review process will result in any transaction or that the Company will be successful in fully executing the Plan of Sale. The Board of Trustees is currently overseeing the Plan of Sale. As a result of the Company's revocation of its REIT election, the Company is no longer required to operate under REIT rules, including the requirement to distribute at least of REIT taxable income to its stockholders, which provides the Company with greater flexibility to sell its assets and use its free cash flow to make principal repayments on its Term Loan Facility. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at applicable tax rates and is no longer entitled to a tax deduction for dividends paid. The Company operated as a REIT since inception and through the 2021 tax year, and existing REIT requirements and limitations, including those established by the Company s organizational documents, remained in place until December 31, 2021. As a result of the Company s change in corporate structure to a taxable C Corporation in fiscal year 2022, the Company incurred a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit of approximately million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The Company also recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes , as discussed in more detail below. The Company sought a shareholder vote to approve a proposed plan of sale of the Company s assets and dissolution (the Plan of Sale that would allow the Board to sell all of the Company s assets, distribute the net proceeds to shareholders and dissolve the Company. The Plan of Sale allows Seritage and potential buyers to enter into and complete value maximizing transactions without subjecting any such transaction to the delay and conditionality associated with having to seek and obtain shareholder approval. On July 6, 2022, Edward Lampert, the Company s former Chairman, entered into a Voting and Support Agreement under which he exchanged his equity interest in the Operating Partnership for Class A common shares and agreed to vote his shares in favor of the Plan of Sale. As of September 30, 2024, Mr. Lampert owns approximatel y o f the Company s outstanding Class A common shares, and Seritage, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is the sole owner of all outstanding Operating Partnership interests. The affirmative vote of at least two-third s of all outstanding common shares of the Company was required to approve the Plan of Sale. The 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders occurred on October 24, 2022, following the Company's filing of a final proxy statement with the SEC on September 14, 2022. During the meeting, the Plan of Sale was approved by the shareholders. The strategic review

million . Additionally, the Company generated investing cash inflows of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were driven by asset sales partially offset by development expenditures and investments in unconsolidated entities. Obligations are projected to continue to exceed property rental income and the Company expects to fund such costs with a combination of capital sources including, but not limited to, cash on hand, sales of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Properties and potential financing transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company sold Consolidated Properties for gross proceeds of million and made aggregate principal prepayments of million on the Term Loan Facility, reducing the outstanding Term Loan Facility balance to million as of September 30, 2024 . Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company sold Consolidated Property for gross proceeds of million and made an additional principal payment of million, reducing the balance of the Term Loan Facility to million as of November 12, 2024. Going Concern In accordance with ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , for each annual and interim reporting period, management evaluates whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As part of this evaluation, the Company takes into consideration all Obligations due within the subsequent 12 months, as well as cash on hand and expected cash receipts. The Company currently anticipates it will continue to use sales of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Properties as the primary source of capital to fund its Obligations, including the principal payments on the Term Loan Facility, while at the same time pursuing alternative financing arrangements. As of November 12, 2024 , there are Consolidated Properties under contract for aggregate gross proceeds of million and there are Unconsolidated Properties under contract at a gross price of million at share. Additionally, the Company is currently negotiating sales for aggregate gross proceeds of million which are not included in the going concern calculation. The Company intends to use proceeds from sales or alternative financing arrangements to satisfy its Obligations. The Company continues to monetize its assets, however, the timing of sales and the amount of proceeds from future sales are not under the Company's control and therefore, cannot be deemed probable. The anticipated proceeds from the sales of assets under contract and existing cash on hand, would not allow the Company to fund its Obligations because the Term Loan Facility which matures July 31, 2025 is presently a current Obligation and as of the filing date the Company has not secured alternative financing. As a result, the Company has concluded that management's plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern will continue until assets under contract are sufficient to increase the Company's projected cash flows or alternative financing arrangements have been made such that they exceed the Company's Obligations. The Company has not entered into any alternative financing arrangements as of the date of the financial statements. The Company has begun to seek alternative financing arrangements, including discussions with its existing lender regarding a potential extension of the Term Loan Facility. As of the filing of this Form 10-Q, the Company does not have any actionable offers to refinance the Term Loan Facility.

All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company s share of management expenses incurred by the unconsolidated entities is reported in equity in loss of unconsolidated entities on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and in other expenses in the combined financial data in Note 4. Leasing and development fees are initially reported at the portion of revenue earned attributable to outside ownership of the related unconsolidated entities. The Company s share in leasing and development fee income is recognized over the useful life of the associated development project, in the case of development fees, or lease term, in the case of leasing fees, as the associated asset is depreciated over the same term and included in equity in loss of unconsolidated entities on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and in other expenses in the combined financial data in Note 4.

corporate alternative minimum tax (the CAMT based on the adjusted financial statement income book income of applicable corporations. The CAMT generally applies to corporations with average annual book income over a 3-year period exceeding billion. The Company does not expect this legislation to have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded to adjust net deferred tax assets to the amount which management believes will more likely than not be recoverable. In making such determination, management considers available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income, and the implementation of prudent tax planning strategies. In the event that the Company is able to utilize its deferred tax assets in excess of their recorded amount, the valuation allowance will be reduced with a corresponding reduction to income tax expense.

The Company has contributed certain properties to unconsolidated entities in exchange for equity interests in those unconsolidated entities. The contribution of property to unconsolidated entities is accounted for as a sale of real estate and the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the sale (the Gain (Loss) based upon the transaction price attributed to the property at the closing of the unconsolidated entities transaction (the Contribution Value ). The Gain or (Loss) is included in gain on sale of real estate on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In certain circumstances, the Contribution Value is subject to revaluation as defined in the respective unconsolidated entity agreements, which may result in an adjustment to the gain or loss recognized. If the Contribution Value is subject to revaluation, the Company initially recognizes the gain or loss at the value that is the expected amount within the range of possible outcomes and will re-evaluate the expected amount on a quarterly basis through the final determination date.

The Company shares in the profits and losses of these unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with the Company s respective equity interests. In some instances, the Company may recognize profits and losses related to investment in an unconsolidated entity that differ from the Company s equity interest in the unconsolidated entity. This may arise from impairments that the Company recognizes related to its investment that differ from the impairments the unconsolidated entity recognizes with respect to its assets, differences between the Company s basis in assets it has transferred to the unconsolidated entity and the unconsolidated entity s basis in those assets or other items. The Company utilizes internally prepared fair value estimates as well as negotiated offers to sell the investments for the impairment analysis. As a result of the Company's analysis, other-than-temporary impairments were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement providing for a billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility with Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska Berkshire Hathaway as lender and administrative agent. The Term Loan Facility provided for an initial funding of billion at closing and includes a million incremental funding facility (the Incremental Funding Facility subject to certain conditions described below. On February 2, 2023, the Company made a million voluntary prepayment, reducing the unpaid principal balance to million, and the debt maturity was extended for to . The Company made additional voluntary prepayments in 2023 aggregating million and additional voluntary prepayments aggregating million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reducing the unpaid principal balance to million at September 30, 2024 . Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company made an additional principal payment of million, reducing the balance of the Term Loan Facility to million as of November 12, 2024. Funded amounts under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at an annual rate of and unfunded amounts under the Incremental Funding Facility are subject to an annual fee of until drawn. The Company prepays the annual fee and amortizes the expense to interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company s ability to access the Incremental Funding Facility is subject to (i) the Company achieving rental income from non-Sears Holdings tenants, on an annualized basis (after giving effect to SNO Leases expected to commence rent payment within 12 months) for the fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of incurrence of the Incremental Funding Facility, of not less than million, (ii) the Company s good faith projection that rental income from non-Sears Holdings tenants (after giving effect to SNO Leases expected to commence rent payment within 12 months) for the succeeding four consecutive fiscal quarters (beginning with the fiscal quarter during which the incremental facility is accessed) will be not less than million, and (iii) the repayment by the Operating Partnership of any deferred interest permitted under the amendment to the Term Loan Amendment as further described below. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not yet achieved the requirements to access the Incremental Funding Facility. The Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by the Company and, subject to certain exceptions, is required to be guaranteed by all existing and future subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Term Loan Facility is secured on a first lien basis by a pledge of the capital stock of the direct subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and the guarantors, including its joint venture interests, except as prohibited by the organizational documents of such entities or any joint venture agreements applicable to such entities, and contains a requirement to provide mortgages and other customary collateral upon the breach of certain financial metrics described below, the occurrence and continuation of an event of default and certain other conditions set forth in the Term Loan Agreement. During 2019, mortgages were recorded on a majority of the Company s portfolio and during the year ended December 31, 2021, mortgages were recorded on the remaining unmortgaged properties in all but two locations. The Term Loan Facility includes certain financial metrics to govern springing collateral requirements and certain covenant exceptions set forth in the Term Loan Agreement, including: (i) a total fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter; (ii) an unencumbered fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter; (iii) a total leverage ratio of not more than ; (iv) an unencumbered ratio of not more than ; and (v) a minimum net worth of at least billion. Any failure to satisfy any of these financial metrics limits the Company's ability to dispose of assets via sale or joint venture and triggers the

in excess of the then applicable interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with certain of the financial metrics described above. As a result, the Company was previously required to receive the consent of Berkshire Hathaway to dispose of assets via sale or contribution to another entity and as of June 16, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway had provided such consent for all such transactions submitted for approval. The Third Term Loan Amendment (defined below), which was executed on June 16, 2022, eliminated this requirement. There are no other impacts under the Term Loan Facility from non-compliance with the financial metrics described above. The Company incurred million of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan Facility which were recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the Term Loan Facility and amortized over the initial term of the Term Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's debt issuance costs were fully amortized. On May 5, 2020, the Operating Partnership and Berkshire Hathaway entered into an amendment (the Term Loan Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement by and among the Operating Partnership and Berkshire Hathaway as initial lender and administrative agent that permits the deferral of payment of interest under the Term Loan Agreement if, as of the first day of each applicable month, (x) the amount of unrestricted and unencumbered (other than liens created under the Term Loan Agreement) cash on hand of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, minus (y) the aggregate amount of anticipated necessary expenditures for such period (such sum, Available Cash is equal to or less than 30.0 million. In such instances, for each interest period, the Operating Partnership is obligated to make payments of interest in an amount equal to the difference between (i) Available Cash and (ii) 20.0 million (provided that such payment shall not exceed the amount of current interest otherwise due under the Term Loan Agreement). Any deferred interest shall accrue interest at in excess of the then applicable interest rate and shall be due and payable on July 31, 2023 ; provided, that the Operating Partnership is required to pay any deferred interest from Available Cash in excess of million (unless otherwise agreed to by the administrative agent under the Term Loan Agreement in its sole discretion). In addition, repayment of any outstanding deferred interest is a condition to any borrowings under the million Incremental Funding Facility under the Term Loan Agreement. The Company has paid all interest due under the Term Loan Agreement and has not deferred any interest as permitted under the amendment to the Term Loan Amendment. Additionally, the First Term Loan Amendment provides that the administrative agent and the lenders express their continued support for asset dispositions, subject to the administrative agent s right to approve the terms of individual transactions due to the occurrence of a Financial Metric Trigger Event, as such term is defined under the Term Loan Agreement. On November 24, 2021, the Operating Partnership, the Company and Berkshire Hathaway entered into an amendment (the Second Term Loan Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement by and among the Operating Partnership, the Company and Berkshire Hathaway to which the Operating Partnership, the Company and Berkshire Hathaway mutually agreed that (i) the make whole provision in the Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement shall not be applicable to prepayments of principal; and (ii) the Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement, as amended for (i) above, may at the Operating Partnership's election be extended for from to (the Maturity Date if its principal has been reduced to million by July 31, 2023. The outstanding principal balance was reduced to million on February 2, 2023, and the Maturity Date has been extended to . On June 16, 2022, the Operating Partnership, the Company and Berkshire Hathaway entered into an amendment (the Third Term Loan Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement by and among the Operating Partnership, the Company and Berkshire Hathaway to which the Operating Partnership, the Company and Berkshire Hathaway mutually agreed that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the asset sale covenant, the parent, borrower, and their respective subsidiaries will be permitted without the consent of the administrative agent to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of properties (including but not limited to properties or equity interests of any subsidiary) to unaffiliated third parties for no less than fair market value, provided that the borrower deposits all net proceeds received into a controlled account and the use of such net proceeds will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Agreement, including but not limited to the restricted payments and investments/loans covenants.

of REIT taxable income to its stockholders, which provides the Company with greater flexibility to use its free cash flow. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on its taxable income at applicable tax rates and is no longer entitled to a tax deduction for dividends paid. The Company operated as a REIT since inception and through the 2021 tax year, and existing REIT requirements and limitations, including those established by the Company s organizational documents, remained in place until December 31, 2021. As a result of the Company s revocation of its REIT status in fiscal year 2022, the Company incurred a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit of approximately million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. As a result of ongoing operations and sales activity, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax asset DTA pursuant to ASC 740, as discussed in more detail below. While the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its DTAs due to the uncertainty that it will be able to utilize them, if the Company is able to sell assets at prices above its tax basis, the DTAs will be utilized to offset any taxes due on those gains to the extent of the DTAs. The Company s effective federal tax rate of differs from the U.S. statutory rate of in 2024 due to the continuing operating losses offset by the change in the valuation allowance. The significant components of the Company s deferred tax assets of million as of September 30, 2024 consist of book to tax basis differences, net operating losses, and carryover net operating losses. As discussed below, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria. ASC 740 states that deferred tax assets shall be reduced by a valuation allowance if there is insufficient objectively verifiable evidence to support that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. This evaluation requires significant judgment which should be weighted commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. Additionally, under ASC 740, forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Given the Company s history of cumulative losses combined with the fact that the Company s utilization of deferred tax assets is highly dependent on the outcome of the review of a broad range of strategic alternatives announced by its Board of Trustees and the uncertainty in timing and volume of future property sales, we have deemed that their realization, at this time, cannot be objectively verified. The Company has therefore recorded a full valuation allowance against the Company s deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 . The Company will evaluate this position each quarter as verifiable positive evidence becomes available, such as the execution of asset sales, to support the future utilization of the deferred tax assets.

impairments were taken during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to negotiations for rent relief with existing tenants that began during the second quarter of 2024, and, in certain circumstances excluding Aventura, agreeing to sell below carrying value, the Company recognized million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due to increasing development and construction costs, deteriorating market conditions and, in certain circumstances excluding Aventura, agreeing to sell below carrying value, the Company recognized million of impairment losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In accordance with ASC 323, Equity Method and Joint Ventures, the Company reviews the carrying value in its investments in unconsolidated entities at each reporting period. The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses in investments in unconsolidated entities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 an d the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of million for the ni ne months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company estimated fair value of certain assets based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate and a residual capitalization rate . For the year ended December 31, 2023 , the Company estimated fair value of certain assets based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate of to and residual capitalization rate of . As significant inputs to the model are unobservable, the Company has determined that the fair values of these properties are classified within Level 3 of the fair value reporting hierarchy. The Company estimated fair value of certain assets based on letters of intent and bids which are subject to judgment as to comparability to the valued property. Because these inputs are derived from observable market data, we have determined that the fair values of these properties are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We consider fair values based upon the agreed-upon contract sales price to be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents, restricted cash and the term loan facility. The fair value of cash equivalents and restricted cash are classified as Level 1 and the fair value of term loan facility is classified as Level 2. Cash equivalents and restricted cash are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair value of debt obligations is calculated by discounting the future contractual cash flows of these instruments using current risk-adjusted rates available to borrowers with similar credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, the estimated fair values of the Company s debt obligations were million and million, respectively, which approximated the carrying value at such dates as the current risk-adjusted rate approximates the stated rates on the Company s debt obligations.

The portfolio consists of approximately 1.5 million square feet of GLA and 208 acres held by 12 consolidated properties (such properties, the Consolidated Properties and 1.2 million square feet of GLA and 134 acres held by nine unconsolidated properties (such properties, the Unconsolidated Properties ). Review of Strategic Alternatives On March 1, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Trustees commenced a process to review a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. The Board of Trustees created a special committee of the Board of Trustees (the Special Committee to oversee the process. The Special Committee retained Barclays Capital, Inc. as its financial advisor from March 2022 through August 2023 to assist with the strategic review. The Company sought a shareholder vote to approve a proposed plan of sale of our assets and dissolution (the Plan of Sale that would allow our board to sell all of our assets, distribute the net proceeds to shareholders and dissolve the Company. The Plan of Sale can be suspended by the Board of Trustees. The 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders occurred on October 24, 2022, at which time the Plan of Sale was approved by the shareholders, following our filing of a final proxy statement with the SEC on September 14, 2022. See Note 1 Organization of the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about the Plan of Sale. The strategic review process remains ongoing as the Company executes the Plan of Sale, and the Company remains open minded to pursuing value maximizing alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. There can be no assurance that the review process will result in any transaction or that the Company will be successful in fully executing on the Plan of Sale. The Board of Trustees is currently overseeing the Plan of Sale. Impairment of Real Estate Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Entities There were no impairments recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Due to negotiations for rent relief with existing tenants that began during the second quarter of 2024 which triggered the need for an impairment analysis pursuant to ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , and, in certain circumstances excluding Aventura, agreeing to sell below carrying value, we recorded impairment losses of 87.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to changes in discount rates and residual capitalization rates between June 2023 and June 2024. We did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated entities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to evaluate our portfolio, including our development plans, hold periods and, if applicable, offers received, which may result in additional impairments in future periods on our consolidated properties and investments in unconsolidated entities.

REIT Election On March 31, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Trustees, with the recommendation of the Special Committee, approved a plan to terminate the Company's REIT status and become a taxable C Corporation, effective for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, the Company is no longer required to operate under REIT rules, including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of REIT taxable income to its stockholders, which provides the Company with greater flexibility to use its free cash flow. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at applicable tax rates and is no longer entitled to a tax deduction for dividends paid. The Company operated as a REIT since inception and through the 2021 tax year, and existing REIT requirements and limitations, including those established by the Company s organizational documents, remained in place until December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes of the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Business Strategies The Company s primary objective is to create value for its shareholders through the monetization of the Company's assets through the Plan of Sale, which can be suspended by the Board of Trustees. We look to enhance sale value through leasing our built footprint, densification of our sites, achievement of entitlements and modification of agreements that govern our properties. We continue to position all remaining assets for sale. Results of Operations We derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties. This revenue generally includes fixed base rents and recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants, in each case as provided in the respective leases. Our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and construction and development related costs. Property operating expenses include real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, management fees, insurance, ground lease costs and utilities; general and administrative expenses include payroll, office expenses, professional fees, and other administrative expenses; and interest expense is on our term loan facility. In addition, we incur substantial non-cash charges for depreciation of our properties and amortization of intangible assets and liabilities.

 The Company recognized rental income on a cash basis for certain tenants at Aventura that are negotiating rent relief resulting in a decrease of revenue of 1.7 million in 2024. The decrease in revenue in 2024 is also driven by the sale of properties since September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.5 million in straight-line rental expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to write off of deferred rents related to property sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Abandoned project costs During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company expensed costs that were previously capitalized in construction in progress on account of a tenant that defaulted on its lease prior to opening and predevelopment costs on a property which the Company is not currently pursuing entitlements. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including the amortization of costs associated with share-based compensation awarded in prior years, consulting expenses, professional fees, office expenses and overhead expenses. The decrease of 0.9 million in general administrative expenses is driven by decreased compensation due to decrease in employee headcount as well as a decrease in consulting related expenses utilized to execute the plan of sale. Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold one property resulting in a gain of 4.2 million, which is included in gain on sale of real estate, net within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net The decrease of 2.9 million of interest and other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is driven by the recognition of 1.8 million of settlement expense to a subcontractor at one of the Company s properties in 2024. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, 0.5 million of previously escrowed funds related to a sold property were received. Interest Expense The decrease of 3.7 million in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by partial Term Loan Facility pay downs.

The decrease for in-place retail leases is primarily driven by the sale of multi-tenant properties in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized rental income on a cash basis for certain tenants at Aventura resulting in a decrease of revenue of 1.7 million. The decrease of 15.9 million in straight-line rental expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to write off of deferred rents related to property sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Property Operating Expenses The decrease of 5.9 million in property operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to asset sales offset by insurance refunds for sold properties that were less than the estimated receivables. Abandoned project costs During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company expensed costs that were previously capitalized in construction in progress on account of a tenant that defaulted on its lease prior to opening and predevelopment costs on a property which the Company is not currently pursuing entitlements. 

 - 30 - 

Real Estate Taxes The decrease in real estate taxes of 1.3 million is primarily driven by property sales and is offset by the increased assessment for the Aventura property. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, including amortization of costs associated with share-based compensation awarded in prior years, professional fees, office expenses and overhead expenses. The decrease of 7.1 million in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a decrease in employee compensation due to reduced headcount and a reduction in consulting services. Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 10 properties for aggregate consideration of 111.7 million and recorded a gain totaling 7.4 million, which is included in gain on sale of real estate, net within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Gain on Sale of Interest in Unconsolidated Entities, Net During the nine months ended September 2023, the Company sold its interest in eight unconsolidated properties, and recorded a gain totaling 6.4 million, which was included in the gain on sale of unconsolidated entities within the consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of Real Estate Assets During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 1.7 million impairment of real estate assets as a result of the Company accepting offers below book value on three properties and an 85.8 million impairment of real estate assets on the Company's development property in Aventura, FL due to negotiations for rent relief with existing tenants that began during the second quarter of 2024 which triggered the need for an impairment analysis pursuant to ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment . The Company determined the fair value of this property by applying a discount to projected cash flows over the estimated hold period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized 107.0 million of impairment losses as a result of recognizing an impairment on the Company's development property in Aventura, FL, which is included within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Entities The decrease of 49.0 million in loss of unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a 70.8 million impairment charge recorded by one unconsolidated entity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's share of the impairment was 35.4 million and was included in the equity in loss of consolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations. An other-than-temporary loss of 12.7 million was also recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net The decrease of 16.2 million of interest and other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is driven by the recognition of 11.6 million of income related to the settlement with the D O insurers for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a settlement expense of 1.8 million to a subcontractor at one of the Company s properties was recorded. Interest Expense The decrease of 18.1 million in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by partial Term Loan Facility pay downs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary uses of cash include the payment of property operating and other expenses, including general and administrative expenses and debt service (collectively, Obligations ), and certain development expenditures. Property rental income, which is the Company s 

 - 31 - 

primary source of operating cash flow, did not fully fund obligations incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the Company recorded net operating cash outflows of 39.6 million. Additionally, the Company generated investing cash inflows of 71.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were driven by asset sales and partially offset by development expenditures. Obligations are projected to continue to exceed property rental income and we expect to fund such obligations and any development expenditures with cash on hand and a combination of capital sources including, but not limited to, sales of Consolidated Properties, sale of interests in Unconsolidated Properties and alternative financing transactions, subject to any approvals that may be required under the Term Loan Agreement. Below is our sales activity since we began our capital recycling program: Sales of Consolidated Properties. We began our capital recycling program in July 2017 and have been monetizing assets since. In March of 2022, we elected to terminate our REIT status effective January 1, 2022 in order to remove any restrictions around asset sales. On October 24, 2022, we received shareholder approval of the Plan of Sale. 

 o We sold 90 Consolidated Properties, and additional outparcels at certain properties, and generated approximately 986.8 million of gross proceeds from the beginning of our capital recycling program in July 2017 through the date our REIT status terminated on December 31, 2021; 

 o We sold 40 Consolidated Properties, and additional outparcels at certain properties, and generated approximately 438.1 million of gross proceeds from December 31, 2021, the date we terminated our REIT status, through the approval of the Plan of Sale on October 24, 2022; 

 o From the approval of the Plan of Sale on October 24, 2022 through September 30, 2024, we sold 86 Consolidated Properties, and additional outparcels at certain properties, and generated approximately 968.2 million of gross proceeds. 

 Sales of interests in Unconsolidated Properties. Certain of our unconsolidated entity agreements also include rights that allow us to sell our interests in select Unconsolidated Properties to our partners at fair market value; 

 o We sold our interests in 15 Unconsolidated Properties and generated approximately 278.1 million of gross proceeds from the beginning of our capital recycling program in July 2017 through the date our REIT status terminated on December 31, 2021; 

 o We sold our interests in 8 Unconsolidated Properties and generated approximately 84.8 million of gross proceeds since we terminated our REIT status on December 31, 2021, through the approval of the Plan of Sale on October 24, 2022; 

 o From the approval of the Plan of Sale on October 24, 2022 through September 30, 2024, we sold our interests in eight Unconsolidated Properties and generated approximately 140.7 million of gross proceeds. 

 Unconsolidated Properties. As of September 30, 2024, we had contributed interests in 12 properties to unconsolidated entities, which generated approximately 242.4 million of gross proceeds since July 2017. In addition to generating liquidity upon closing, these entities also reduce our development expenditures by the amount of our partners interests in the unconsolidated entities; 

 As of November 12, 2024, we had two assets under contract for sale with no due diligence contingencies for total anticipated proceeds of 33.7 million and three assets under contract for sale subject to customary due diligence for total anticipated proceeds of 54.2 million at share. All five assets are subject to closing conditions. As previously disclosed, on May 5, 2020, the Operating Partnership and Berkshire Hathaway entered into an amendment (the Term Loan Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement by and among the Operating Partnership and Berkshire Hathaway as initial lender and administrative agent that permits the deferral of payment of interest under the Term Loan Agreement if, as of the first day of each applicable month, (x) the amount of unrestricted and unencumbered (other than liens created under the Term Loan Agreement) cash on hand of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, minus (y) the aggregate amount of anticipated necessary expenditures for such period (such sum, Available Cash is equal to or less than 30.0 million. In such instances, for each interest period, the Operating Partnership is obligated to make payments of interest in an amount equal to the difference between (i) Available Cash and (ii) 20.0 million (provided that such payment shall not exceed the amount of current interest otherwise due under the Term Loan Agreement). Any deferred interest shall accrue interest at 2.0 in excess of the then applicable interest rate and shall be due and payable on July 31, 2023; provided, that the Operating Partnership is required to pay any deferred interest from Available Cash in excess of 30.0 million (unless otherwise agreed to by the administrative agent under the Term Loan Agreement in its sole discretion). In addition, repayment 

 - 32 - 

of any outstanding deferred interest is a condition to any borrowings under the 400.0 million incremental funding facility under the Term Loan Agreement (the Incremental Funding Facility ). Additionally, the Term Loan Amendment provides that the administrative agent and the lenders express their continued support for asset dispositions, subject to the administrative agent s right to approve the terms of individual transactions due to the occurrence of a Financial Metric Trigger Event, as such term is defined under the Term Loan Agreement. The Third Term Loan Amendment (as defined in Note 6 Debt of the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) executed on June 16, 2022 provided exceptions to this right. Our Term Loan Facility includes a 400.0 million Incremental Funding Facility, access to which is subject to rental income from non-Sears Holdings tenants of at least 200.0 million, on an annualized basis and after giving effect to SNO leases expected to commence rent payment within 12 months, which we have not yet achieved, as disclosed in Note 6. There is no assurance of the Company s ability to access the Incremental Funding Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have repaid 80.0 million against the principal of the Term Loan Facility. Our outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024, is 280.0 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company made an additional principal payment of 25.0 million, reducing the balance of the Term Loan Facility to 255.0 million as of November 12, 2024. See Note 1 Organization of the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of liquidity and the substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Board of Trustees will determine future distributions on the Company's common shares following the pay down of the Term Loan Facility. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company accounts for its investments in entities that it does not have a controlling interest in or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Contractual Obligations There have been no significant changes in the contractual obligations disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Capital Expenditures During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invested 3.3 million and 25.7 million, respectively in our consolidated development and operating properties and an additional 5.8 million and 9.0 million, respectively into our unconsolidated joint ventures, as we continue to advance our business plans, including our previously announced projects. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company invested 11.7 million and 61.6 million, respectively in our consolidated development and operating properties and an additional 0.8 million and 11.9 million, respectively into our unconsolidated joint ventures. Litigation and Other Matters In accordance with accounting standards regarding loss contingencies, we accrue an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued or disclose the fact that such a range of loss cannot be estimated. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. In such cases, we disclose the nature of the contingency, and an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss, or disclose the fact that an estimate cannot be made. On July 1, 2024, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Zhengxu He, Trustee of the He Fang 2005 Revocable Living Trust v. Seritage Growth Properties, Case No. 1:24:CV:05007, alleging that the Company, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, and the Company s Chief Financial Officer violated the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks to bring a class action on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Company securities between July 7, 2022 and May 10, 2024. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by issuing false, misleading, and/or omissive disclosures concerning the Company s alleged lack of effective internal controls regarding the identification and review of impairment indicators for investments in real estate and the Company s value and projected gross proceeds of certain real estate assets. The complaint seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount to be 

 - 34 - 

proven at trial, an award of reasonable costs and expenses to the plaintiff and class counsel, and such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. On March 2, 2021, we brought a lawsuit in Delaware state court against QBE Insurance Corporation, Endurance American Insurance Company, Allianz Global Risks US Insurance Company and Continental Casualty Company, each of which are D O insurance providers of the Company (the D O Insurers ). Our lawsuit sought, among other things, declaratory relief and money damages as a result of certain of the D O Insurers refusal to pay certain costs and expenses related to the defense of the litigation related to the bankruptcy of Sears Holdings (the Litigation ). The Litigation was settled in 2022 and the Litigation was dismissed. Any amounts received from the insurers will offset the Seritage Defendants contribution. We reached settlement agreements with two of the D O Insurers for gross proceeds of 12.7 million which is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2023, we reached settlement agreements with the other two D O Insurers for gross proceeds of 11.6 million. We received 11.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. We are subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business and due to the current environment. While the resolution of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on currently available information, the final outcome of such ordinary course legal proceedings and claims will not have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
 See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies Litigation and Other Matters of the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the Litigation and related matters. Critical Accounting Policies A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to these policies. Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures and Definitions The Company makes reference to NOI-cash basis and NOI-cash basis at share which are financial measures that include adjustments to GAAP. Net Operating Income (Loss)-cash basis NOI -cash basis) and Net Operating Income (Loss)-cash basis at share NOI-cash basis at share NOI - cash basis is defined as income from property operations less property operating expenses, adjusted for variable items such as termination fee income, as well as non-cash items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles. Other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI-cash basis, and accordingly the Company s depiction of NOI-cash basis may not be comparable to other real estate companies. The Company believes NOI-cash basis provides useful information regarding Seritage, its financial condition, and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. The Company also uses NOI-cash basis at share, which includes its proportional share of Unconsolidated Properties. The Company does not control any of the joint ventures constituting such properties and NOI-cash basis at share does not reflect our legal claim with respect to the economic activity of such joint ventures. We have included this adjustment because the Company believes this form of presentation offers insights into the financial performance and condition of the Company as a whole given our ownership of Unconsolidated Properties that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method. The operating agreements of the Unconsolidated Properties generally allow each investor to receive cash distributions to the extent there is available cash from operations. The amount of cash each investor receives is based upon specific provisions of each operating agreement and varies depending on certain factors including the amount of capital contributed by each investor and whether any investors are entitled to preferential distributions. The Company also considers NOI-cash basis and NOI-cash basis at share to be a helpful supplemental measure of its operating performance because it excludes from NOI variable items such as termination fee income, as well as non-cash items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles. Due to the adjustments noted, NOI-cash basis and NOI-cash basis at share should only be used as an alternative measure of the Company s financial performance.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures Neither NOI-cash basis nor NOI-cash basis at share are measures that (i) represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) are indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions; (iii) are alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity; or (iv) should be considered alternatives to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating the Company s operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the respective GAAP measures we deem most comparable are presented below on a comparative basis for all periods. The following table reconciles NOI-cash basis and NOI-cash basis at share to GAAP net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Item 3.	 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There were no material changes in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk set forth in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 4.	 Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act )). Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 - 36 - 

Material Weaknesses A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously reported, management identified material weaknesses due to deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over the impairment of investments in real estate and other-than-temporary impairment of equity method investments. The deficiencies related to the identification of impairment indicators. Additionally, as management determined that it had not maintained adequate evidence of the review of information used in the impairment indicator analysis and the fair value of investments in real estate and equity method investments. As further reported, management had identified a deficiency in the operating effectiveness in our review over the calculation of other-than-temporary impairments. These deficiencies contributed to the potential for there to be material errors in our financial statements. Additionally, as previously reported, management identified a material weakness due to a deficiency in the design of our controls over the accounting for certain non-routine transactions, particularly related to accounting for transactions with joint ventures and certain consulting contracts. For these transactions, Management did not possess the adequate technical capabilities to appropriately assess these non-routine transactions to ensure compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. This deficiency contributed to the potential for there to be material errors in our financial statements. Update on Remediation Plan As previously reported, in response to the material weaknesses, management, with oversight of the Audit Committee began to implement steps to remediate the material weaknesses. While the Company has made progress with the remediation of these material weaknesses, the remediation efforts are ongoing, because additional time is needed to complete the remediation and allow for the internal controls to be tested by management. However, the material weaknesses discussed above cannot be considered completely remediated until the applicable controls are fully implemented, have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Other than described above, there were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.	OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.	 Legal Proceedings The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to Note 9 of the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. On July 1, 2024, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Zhengxu He, Trustee of the He Fang 2005 Revocable Living Trust v. Seritage Growth Properties, Case No. 1:24:CV:05007, alleging that the Company, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, and the Company s Chief Financial Officer violated the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks to bring a class action on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Company securities between July 7, 2022 and May 10, 2024. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by issuing false, misleading, and/or omissive disclosures concerning the Company s alleged lack of effective internal controls regarding the identification and review of impairment indicators for investments in real estate and the Company s value and projected gross proceeds of certain real estate assets. The complaint seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount to be proven at trial, an award of reasonable costs and expenses to the plaintiff and class counsel, and such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Item 1A.	 Risk F actors Please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a description of certain material risks and uncertainties to which our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have been, and in the future may be, subject to securities class action and other litigation, which may harm our business and results of operations. We are involved in legal proceedings related to various matters, including securities litigation, and may become involved in other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the future. For example, as discussed further in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item I, on July 1, 2024, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a class action lawsuit alleging that the Company, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, and the Company s Chief Financial Officer violated the federal securities laws by issuing false, misleading, and/or omissive disclosures concerning the Company s alleged lack of effective internal controls regarding the identification and review of impairment indicators for investments in real estate and the Company s value and projected gross proceeds of certain real estate assets. The complaint seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount to be proven at trial, an award of reasonable costs and expenses to the plaintiff and class counsel, and such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations but there can be no assurance as of outcome. An unfavorable outcome in this litigation and other legal proceedings may have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity of the Company. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3.	 Defaults Upo n Senior Securities None. Item 4.	 Mine Saf ety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5.	 Other Information a) None. 

 b) None. 

 c) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
