As stated in the Third Amendment, the ABL Facility requires the Borrowers to maintain a (i) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than :1.00 and (ii) maximum total leverage ratio of :1.00. The ABL Facility also contains a number of customary negative covenants. Such covenants, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of each of the Borrowers, their restricted subsidiaries, and where applicable, Topaz, to: incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock and make guarantees; incur liens on assets; engage in mergers or consolidations or fundamental changes; sell assets; pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock; make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; amend organizational documents and master lease documents; enter into certain agreements that would restrict the ability to pay dividends; repay certain junior indebtedness; and change the conduct of its business.

Accumulated amortization expense related to the deferred financing costs was approximately million and million as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accumulated amortization of the original issue discount was approximately million and million as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As previously mentioned, the partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023 was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of debt and consequently, a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount were expensed through loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as of the prepayment date. The Company recognized a charge of approximately million in loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Accumulated amortization related to revolver deferred financing costs for the ABL Facility was approximately million and million as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Revolver deferred financing costs are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 within deferred financing costs revolver, net. In connection with the First Amendment, which was considered a modification for accounting purposes, any unamortized deferred financing costs from the ABL Facility that pertained to non-continuing lenders were expensed through loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as of the amendment date. As such, the Company recognized a charge of approximately million in loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs pertaining to non-continuing lenders for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As the borrowing capacity of each of the continuing lenders on the amended ABL Facility was greater than the borrowing capacity of the ABL Facility before the amendment, the unamortized deferred financing costs at the time of the modification of approximately million associated with the continuing lenders was deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the ABL Facility. Additionally, the Company incurred and paid approximately million and million of deferred financing costs as a result of the First Amendment and Third Amendment of the ABL Facility, which are capitalized and presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, within deferred financing costs revolver, net. These costs are amortized over the contractual term of the line-of-credit through the maturity date using the straight-line method. Refer to the components of interest expense in the table above for the amounts of the amortization expense related to the deferred financing costs and original issue discount recognized for each of these debt instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The purchase price of the Private Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Public Offering and was held in the Trust Account until the formation of the Company on March 15, 2019. The Private Warrants (including the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Warrants) were not transferable, assignable or salable until after the formation of the Company on March 15, 2019, and they may be exercised on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers of the Private Warrants or their permitted transferees. The Company evaluated the Private Warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders equity and should be classified as liabilities. Since the Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, the Company recorded the Private Warrants as liabilities on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the Private Warrants are reflected in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

The Company accounts for income taxes in interim periods under ASC 740-270, Income Taxes Interim Reporting , which generally requires us to apply an estimated annual consolidated effective tax rate to consolidated pre-tax income.

Common Stock in Treasury In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted into law and imposed a nondeductible excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The Company reflected the applicable excise tax in equity as part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and recorded a corresponding liability for the excise taxes payable in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 in an amount of approximately million. On November 3, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the Company to repurchase up to million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and the timing and exact amount of any repurchases will depend on various factors, including market pricing and conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations, and other factors. Any shares of common stock repurchased will be held as treasury shares. Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost. The Company may repurchase its shares in open market transactions from time to time or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with federal securities laws, at the Company's discretion. The repurchase program, which has no expiration date, may be increased, suspended, or terminated at any time. The program is expected to be implemented over the course of several years and is conducted subject to the covenants in the agreements governing the Company's indebtedness. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of Common Stock for an aggregated price of approximately million (excluding the excise tax discussed above).

The fair value of each option award at the grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: - Expected dividend yield Expected term (years) Risk-free interest rate (range) - Exercise price (range) - The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is based on peer group volatility as the Company did not have a sufficient trading history as a stand-alone public company to calculate volatility at the time of estimating the fair value of each option at the grant date. Additionally, due to an insufficient history with respect to stock option activity and post vesting cancellations, the expected term assumption is based on the simplified method permitted under SEC rules, whereby, the simple average of the vesting period for each tranche of award and its contractual term is aggregated to arrive at a weighted average expected term for the award. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied US Treasury bill yield curve at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company s expected term assumption.

The PCC Community contributed lower revenues as compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven primarily by lower non-cash revenue amortization of an advanced payment for community expansion associated with the prior contract that became fully amortized as of November 2023, and to a lesser extent, by a decrease in the minimum lease revenue component of the New PCC Contract compared to the prior contract that ended in November 2023. The Company generated cash inflows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 121.1 million compared to approximately 118.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in cash flows from operations of approximately 2.6 million or 2 driven by an increase in cash collections, a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes, an 8.7 million decrease in cash paid for interest driven by a significant reduction in debt outstanding during the current period compared to the prior period, and an increase in interest income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company also purchased 2,424,440 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 22.3 million (exclusive of estimated excise taxes of approximately 0.1 million). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other key drivers of financial performance included: Decreased revenue of 50.7 million, or 35 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by lower revenue generated from the Government segment primarily from lower non-cash revenue amortization of an advanced payment for community build-out and mobilization of asset activities associated with the Company s PCC community, which was fully amortized as of November 2023. Generated net income of approximately 20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net income of approximately 45.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue and the change in the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities, partially offset by a decrease service costs driven primarily by lower costs in the Government segment as a result of operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the

 PCC Community, a decrease in specialty rental costs, a decrease in depreciation of specialty rental assets, a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses led by a decrease in stock compensation expense, an increase in interest income earned on cash equivalents funded by the increase in available cash as a result of cash flows from operations, and a decrease in income tax expense led by a decrease in income before income tax. Generated consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of 49.7 million representing a decrease of 45.4 million, or 48 as compared to the same period in 2023, driven primarily by the decrease in revenue led by the lower non-cash revenue amortization mentioned above that ended in November 2023 associated with the prior PCC Contract, partially offset by a 13 decrease in operating expenses comprised of a decrease in services costs and specialty rental costs. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is Net Income. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a definition and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. Our Government segment, including several communities in West, Texas supporting critical United States government humanitarian aid efforts, delivers essential services and accommodations near the southern United States border where there is insufficient housing and infrastructure solutions to appropriately care for unaccompanied minor immigrants. Demand for these communities and services is influenced by immigration activity, where continued increases in migrant populations has increased government spending and demand for appropriate government supported solutions. Demand for these communities and services is also impacted by federal government budgeting, appropriations, and federal government administration policy decisions. Our proximity to customer activities influences occupancy and demand. We have built, own and operate the largest specialty rental and hospitality services network available to customers operating in the HFS South region. Our broad network often results in us having communities that are the closest to our customers job sites, which reduces commute times and costs, and improves the overall safety of our customers workforce. Our communities provide customers with cost efficiencies, as they are able to jointly use our communities and related infrastructure (i.e., power, water, sewer and IT) services alongside other customers operating in the same vicinity. Demand for our services is dependent upon activity levels, particularly our customers capital spending on natural resource development activities. Factors Affecting Results of Operations We expect our business to continue to be affected by the key factors discussed below, as well as factors discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results . Supply and Demand for Natural Resources As a provider of vertically integrated specialty rental and hospitality services, we are not directly impacted by commodity price fluctuations. However, these price fluctuations indirectly influence our activities and results of operations because the natural resource development workforce is directly affected by price fluctuations and the industry s expansion or contraction as a result of these fluctuations. Our occupancy volume depends on the size of the workforce within the natural resources industry and the demand for labor. Commodity prices are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for natural resources, the commodities trading markets, as well as other supply and demand factors that may influence commodity prices. Availability and Cost of Capital Capital markets conditions could affect our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets to the extent necessary to fund our future growth. Interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly, and could limit our ability to raise funds, or increase the price of raising funds, in the capital markets and may limit our ability to expand.

 Regulatory Compliance We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid, and hazardous waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination. In addition, we may be subject, indirectly, to various statutes and regulations applicable to doing business with the U.S. government as a result of our contracts with U.S. government contractor clients. The risks of substantial costs, liabilities, and limitations on our operations related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise, or be discovered that create substantial compliance or environmental remediation liabilities and costs. Public Policy We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our subcontracts with government contractors. The U.S. government and, by extension, our U.S. government contractor customers, may from time to time adopt, implement or modify certain policies or directives that may adversely affect our business. Changes in government policy, presidential administration or other changes in the political landscape relating to immigration policies may similarly result in a decline in our revenues in the Government segment. Natural Disasters or Other Significant Disruption An operational disruption in any of our facilities could negatively impact our financial results. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as earthquake, tornado, severe weather including hail storms, flood, fire, or other unanticipated problems such as public health threats or outbreaks, labor difficulties, equipment failure, capacity expansion difficulties or unscheduled maintenance could cause operational disruptions of varied duration. These types of disruptions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations to varying degrees dependent upon the facility, the duration of the disruption, our ability to shift business to another facility or find alternative solutions. Overview of Our Revenue and Operations We derive the majority of our revenue from specialty rental accommodations and vertically integrated hospitality services. Approximately 68 of our revenue was earned from specialty rental with vertically integrated hospitality services, specifically lodging and related ancillary services, whereas the remaining 32 of revenues were earned through leasing of lodging facilities the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue is recognized in the period in which lodging and services are provided pursuant to the terms of contractual relationships with our customers. In certain of our contracts, rates may vary over the contract term, in these cases, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables for which arrangement consideration is allocated between lodging and services based on the relative estimated standalone selling price of each deliverable. The estimated price of lodging and services deliverables is based on the prices of lodging and services when sold separately or based upon the best estimate of selling price. Key Indicators of Financial Performance Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and tend to review these measurements frequently for consistency and trend analysis. We primarily review the following profit and loss information when assessing our performance: Revenue We analyze our revenues by comparing actual revenues to our internal budgets and projections for a given period and to prior periods to assess our performance. We believe that revenues are a meaningful indicator of the demand and pricing for our services. Key drivers to change in revenues may include average utilization of existing beds, levels of development activity in the HFS South segment, the consumer price index impacting government contracts, and government spending on housing programs.

 Adjusted Gross Profit We analyze our adjusted gross profit, which is a Non-GAAP measure, which we define as revenues less cost of sales, excluding impairment and depreciation of specialty rental assets to measure our financial performance. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a definition and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe adjusted gross profit is a meaningful metric because it provides insight into the financial performance of our revenue streams without consideration of company overhead. Additionally, using adjusted gross profit gives us insight on factors impacting cost of sales, such as efficiencies of our direct labor and material costs. When analyzing adjusted gross profit, we compare actual adjusted gross profit to our budgets and internal projections and to prior period results for a given period in order to assess our performance. We also use Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows to evaluate the operating performance of our business. For a more in-depth discussion of the Non-GAAP measures, please refer to the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section. Segments We have identified two reportable business segments: HFS South and Government: HFS South The HFS South segment reflects our facilities and operations in the HFS South region from customers in the natural resources development industry and includes our 16 communities located across Texas and New Mexico. Government The Government segment includes the facilities and operations of the family residential center and the related support communities in Dilley, Texas (the South Texas Family Residential Center provided under a lease and services agreement with a national provider of migrant programming (the FRCC Partner ). As previously mentioned, the contract for the South Texas Family Residential Center with the FRCC Partner terminated on August 9, 2024. The Company retains ownership of the assets associated with the South Texas Family Residential Center enabling the Company to continue utilizing these modular solutions to support customer demand across its existing operating segments and other potential growth opportunities. Additionally, this segment also includes facilities and operations provided under a lease and services agreement with our NP Partner, backed by a committed U.S. Government contract, to provide a suite of comprehensive service offerings in support of their humanitarian aid efforts. All Other Our other facilities and operations which do not meet the criteria to be a separate reportable segment are consolidated and reported as All Other which represents the facilities and operations of one community in Canada, three communities in North Dakota, and the catering and other services provided to communities and other workforce accommodation facilities for the natural resource development industries not owned by us. Key Factors Impacting the Comparability of Results The historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either to each other or to our future results of operations, for the reasons described below: Government Segment During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed the Expanded Humanitarian Contract that went into effect in May 2022 to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive facility services that support the critical hospitality solutions the Company provides to the NP Partner and the United States Government in their humanitarian aid missions. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant scope expansion and term extension for the 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 continuation of services provided under the agreement that originated in March 2021. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract operated with similar structure to the Company s prior government services subcontracts, which are centered around minimum revenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract included occupancy-based variable services revenue that aligned with active community population. The minimum revenue commitments, which consisted of annual recurring lease revenue and nonrecurring infrastructure enhancement revenue, provided for a minimum annual revenue contribution of approximately 390 million and was fully committed over its initial contract term. Inclusive of all potential occupancy-based variable services revenue, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a maximum initial annual total contract amount of approximately 575 million. On May 15, 2023, the Company executed a six-month extension of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, which extended the period of performance through November 15, 2023 and increased the contract value, with no change to contract structure or any other existing economic terms. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract expired as of November 15, 2023. The non-recurring infrastructure enhancement revenue was generated from an advance payment made during the year ended December 31, 2022 for the community build-out, and mobilization of asset activities related to the community expansion associated with the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. The advanced payment was determined to be related to future services to be amortized to revenue over the estimated term of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. This advance payment revenue amortization ended when the Expanded Humanitarian Contract expired on November 15, 2023. As such, the prior period for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included this revenue amortization in the amount of approximately 35.3 million and 104.8 million, respectively. whereas the current period does not. Additionally, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract included an annual minimum lease revenue commitment of approximately 196 million that impacted the prior period compared to the current period being impacted by an annual minimum lease revenue commitment of approximately 178 million under the New PCC Contract explained below. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company executed the New PCC Contract, pursuant to an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Task Order between our NP Partner and the United States Government, that replaced the Expanded Humanitarian Contract and became effective on November 16, 2023. The New PCC Contract includes a one-year base period through November 15, 2024, an option to extend for up to four additional one-year periods, and an option to extend for up to six months upon the conclusion of the base period or any of the option periods. Under the New PCC Contract, the Company will maintain similar facility size and operational scope compared to the Expanded Humanitarian Contract. The New PCC Contract operates with similar structure to the Company s prior and existing government services subcontracts, which are centered around minimum revenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the New PCC Contract includes occupancy-based variable services revenue that will align with active community population. The minimum revenue commitments, which consist of annual recurring lease revenue, provide for a minimum annual revenue contribution of approximately 178 million. Assuming all option periods are exercised, the 5-year cumulative minimum revenue commitment of the New PCC Contract is expected to be approximately 892 million through 2028. Additionally, as previously mentioned, the STFRC Contract terminated on August 9, 2024 and no longer contributed to total consolidated revenue of the Company from that termination date of August 9, 2024. As such, the termination of the STFRC Contract as well as the change from the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract to the New PCC Contract impacts comparability between periods.

 Results of Operations The period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations have been prepared using the historical periods included in our unaudited consolidated financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. Consolidated Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in thousands) : 

For the Three Months Ended Amount of Percentage Change September 30, Increase Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenue: Services income 65,796 93,538 (27,742) (30) Specialty rental income 29,395 52,401 (23,006) (44) Total revenue 95,191 145,939 (50,748) (35) Costs: Services 31,262 34,035 (2,773) (8) Specialty rental 4,662 7,495 (2,833) (38) Depreciation of specialty rental assets 14,057 17,653 (3,596) (20) Gross Profit 45,210 86,756 (41,546) (48) Selling, general and administrative 13,319 15,273 (1,954) (13) Other depreciation and amortization 3,902 3,838 64 2 Other income, net (2) (71) 69 (97) Operating income 27,991 67,716 (39,725) (59) Interest expense, net 3,813 4,953 (1,140) (23) Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 2,576 (2,576) (100) Income before income tax 24,178 60,187 (36,009) (60) Income tax expense 4,084 14,608 (10,524) (72) Net income 20,094 45,579 (25,485) (56) Less: Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 100 100 100 Net income attributable to Target Hospitality Corp. common stockholders 19,994 45,579 (25,585) (56) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 Total Revenue. Total revenue was 95.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of 65.8 million of services income and 29.4 million of specialty rental income. Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 145.9 million, which consisted of 93.5 million of services income and 52.4 million of specialty rental income. Services income consists primarily of specialty rental and vertically integrated and comprehensive hospitality services, including room revenue, catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, overall workforce community management, health and recreation facilities, concierge services, and laundry service. The main driver of the decrease in services income revenue year over year was lower revenue in the Government segment in the current period from the decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as well as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period, and the termination of the STFRC Contract. Specialty rental income consists primarily of revenues from leasing rooms and other facilities at certain communities that include contractual arrangements with customers that are considered leases under the authoritative accounting guidance for leases. Specialty rental income decreased primarily as a result of lower revenue in the Government segment from the decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from

 the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as well as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period, and the termination of the STFRC Contract. Cost of services. Cost of services was 31.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 34.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in services costs is primarily due to a decrease in services costs from the Government segment driven by operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, including lease terminations as a result of the purchase of certain previously leased equipment and partially by the termination of the STFRC contract in the Government segment as previously discussed. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs of approximately 2.2 million in the HFS-South segment to support increased customer demand. Specialty rental costs. Specialty rental costs were 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in specialty rental costs is primarily due to a decrease in costs from the Government segment driven by operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, and partially by the termination of the STFRC contract in the Government segment as previously discussed. Depreciation of specialty rental assets. Depreciation of specialty rental assets was 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in depreciation expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation on certain specialty rental assets and related leasehold improvements acquired or built in 2022 to support growth of the Government segment related to the contract that originated in May of 2022 with the NP Partner, which became fully depreciated during the year ended December 31, 2023. Decreases in depreciation expense associated with HFS-South specialty rental assets also partially contributed to this decrease in depreciation of specialty rental assets for certain site work assets that became fully depreciated during 2024. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative was 13.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense from the prior period as a result of a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately 3.2 million led primarily by the liability-based stock appreciation right awards SARs driven by a lower number of SAR awards outstanding during the current period compared to the prior period as approximately 50 of such awards were outstanding as of September 30, 2023 compared to 0 in the current period as there are no remaining awards outstanding as of September 30, 2024 as these awards vested and were exercised as of September 30, 2024. This was offset by an increase in transaction fees of approximately 1.5 million associated primarily with the Proposal described in Recent Developments in Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. The remaining change was primarily driven by a decrease in non-cash amortization of capitalized system implementation costs that became fully amortized during 2024. Other depreciation and amortization. Other depreciation and amortization expense was 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other depreciation and amortization is primarily driven by an increase in depreciation associated with an increase in finance leases for commercial use vehicles. Other expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net was less than (0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net was 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in interest expense, net was primarily driven by an increase in interest income earned on cash equivalents funded by the increase in available cash as a result of cash flows from operations. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities represents the fair value adjustments to the outstanding Private Warrant liabilities based on the change in their estimated fair value at each reporting period end. 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 The change in fair value of the warrant liabilities was 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the Private Warrants expiring unredeemed on March 15, 2024 as discussed in Note 9 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. Income tax expense. Income tax expense was 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to the decrease in income before taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 led by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by cost decreases previously mentioned. Consolidated Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023( in thousands) : 

For the Nine Months Ended Amount of Percentage Change September 30, Increase Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenue: Services income 205,685 280,897 (75,212) (27) Specialty rental income 96,899 156,491 (59,592) (38) Total revenue 302,584 437,388 (134,804) (31) Costs: Services 101,734 109,469 (7,735) (7) Specialty rental 16,059 23,592 (7,533) (32) Depreciation of specialty rental assets 43,643 53,242 (9,599) (18) Gross Profit 141,148 251,085 (109,937) (44) Selling, general and administrative 41,632 43,929 (2,297) (5) Other depreciation and amortization 11,695 11,482 213 2 Other expense (income), net (158) 1,244 (1,402) (113) Operating income 87,979 194,430 (106,451) (55) Loss on extinguishment of debt 2,128 (2,128) (100) Interest expense, net 12,673 17,726 (5,053) (29) Change in fair value of warrant liabilities (675) (1,809) 1,134 (63) Income before income tax 75,981 176,385 (100,404) (57) Income tax expense 17,118 40,528 (23,410) (58) Net income 58,863 135,857 (76,994) (57) Less: Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 100 100 100 Net income attributable to Target Hospitality Corp. common stockholders 58,763 135,857 (77,094) (57) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 Total Revenue. Total revenue was 302.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of 205.7 million of services income and 96.9 million of specialty rental income. Total revenue was 437.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of 280.9 million of services income and 156.5 million of specialty rental income. Services income consists primarily of specialty rental and vertically integrated and comprehensive hospitality services, including room revenue, catering and food services, maintenance, housekeeping, grounds-keeping, security, overall workforce community management, health and recreation facilities, concierge services, and laundry service. The main driver of the decrease in services income revenue year over year was lower revenue in the Government segment in the current period from the decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as well as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current

 period, and the termination of the STFRC Contract, partially offset by an increase in revenue in the HFS South segment led by an increase in customer activity. Specialty rental income consists primarily of revenues from leasing rooms and other facilities at certain communities that include contractual arrangements with customers that are considered leases under the authoritative accounting guidance for leases. Specialty rental income decreased primarily as a result of lower revenue in the Government segment from the decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023, partially by lower minimum lease revenue as well as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period, and the termination of the STFRC Contract. Cost of services. Cost of services was 101.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 109.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in services costs is primarily due to a decrease in services costs in the Government segment driven by operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, including lease terminations as a result of the purchase of certain previously leased equipment. Approximately 1 million of this decrease was driven by a community in the All Other category that incurred lodge removal and transportation costs in the prior period that didn t recur in the current period, while approximately 0.3 million of this decrease was driven by the termination of the STFRC Contract. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately 1.7 million in the HFS-South segment related to an increase in operational costs from community expansion to support increased customer demand in the HFS-South segment, partially offset by the prior period including asset mobilization and integration costs associated with a new community acquired in January 2023 that didn t recur in the current period and operational efficiencies achieved in the current period. Specialty rental costs. Specialty rental costs were 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in specialty rental costs is primarily due to a decrease in costs from the Government segment driven by operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, termination of the STFRC Contract in the Government segment, and partially by operational efficiencies achieved in the current period in the HFS-South segment. Depreciation of specialty rental assets. Depreciation of specialty rental assets was 43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 53.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in depreciation expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation on certain specialty rental assets and related leasehold improvements acquired or built in 2022 to support growth of the Government segment related to the contract that originated in May of 2022 with the NP Partner, which became fully depreciated during the year ended December 31, 2023, while approximately 1.8 million of this decrease was driven by a decrease in depreciation of specialty rental assets in the HFS-South segment for certain assets that became fully depreciated during 2024. Selling, general and administrative . Selling, general and administrative was 41.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 43.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense of (2.3) million was primarily driven by a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately 8.3 million led primarily by the liability-based stock appreciation right awards SARs driven by a lower number of SAR awards outstanding during the current period compared to the prior period as approximately 50 of such awards were outstanding as of September 30, 2023 compared to 0 in the current period as there are no remaining awards outstanding as of September 30, 2024 as these awards vested and were exercised as of September 30, 2024. Other corporate costs (i.e. recruiting, market research, and outside services) also decreased by approximately 0.5 million from the prior period. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in severance of approximately 1 million for certain terminated employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other compensation and benefits cost increases of approximately 0.8 million, audit fee increases of approximately 0.4 million, other professional fee increases of approximately 0.5 million, insurance expense increase of approximately 0.3 million, and an increase in transaction fees of approximately 3.5 million associated with certain transactions, including primarily the Proposal described in Recent

 Developments in Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. Other depreciation and amortization. Other depreciation and amortization expense was 11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other depreciation and amortization is primarily driven by an increase in depreciation associated with an increase in finance leases for commercial use vehicles. Other expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net was (0.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expense is primarily driven by costs incurred on the disposal of assets in the All Other segment category in the prior period, which didn t recur in the current period. Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt is due to the partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023, which was accounted for as a partial extinguishment of debt and resulted in a charge of approximately 1.7 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized original issue discount. Approximately 0.4 million of the change related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs for non-continuing lenders in connection with the First Amendment to the ABL Facility on February 1, 2023. No such activity occurred in the current period. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net was 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in interest expense, net was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense on the Senior Secured Notes of approximately 2.7 million driven by the lower outstanding debt balance in the current period as approximately 153.1 million of the Senior Secured Notes were paid off during the year ended December 31, 2023. Approximately 1.7 million of this decrease was driven by lower deferred financing cost amortization on the Senior Secured Notes during the current period due to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the partial extinguishment of debt associated with the partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023 discussed above. Approximately 1.8 million of this decrease was driven by an increase in interest income earned on cash equivalents funded by the increase in available cash as a result of cash flows from operations. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in Senior Secured Note original issue discount amortization of approximately 0.9 million driven by fees incurred in connection with the Senior Note Exchange that closed on November 1, 2023 as more fully discussed in Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. Additionally, these decreases were partially offset by an increase in ABL Facility deferred financing costs amortization and unused line fee expenses combined of approximately 0.3 million driven by the ABL Facility amendments completed in the prior year as more fully discussed in Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities . Change in fair value of warrant liabilities represents the fair value adjustments to the outstanding Private Warrant liabilities based on the change in their estimated fair value at each reporting period end. The change in fair value of the warrant liabilities was (0.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to (1.8) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities is the result of changes in market prices deriving the value of the financial instruments. The estimated value of the Private Warrants decreased in the current period, generating an increase to income in the current period. There is also a lower number of outstanding Private Warrants in the current period compared to the prior period given the Private Warrants expired on March 15, 2024 as discussed in Note 9 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q. Income tax expense. Income tax expense was 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to the decrease in income before taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 led by a decrease in revenue, partially offset by cost decreases previously mentioned.

Average daily rate is calculated based on specialty rental income and services income received over the period indicated, divided by utilized bed nights. Government Revenue for the Government segment was 53.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 105.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted gross profit for the Government segment was 46.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 90.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue decreased primarily due to the decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023 and partially by lower minimum lease revenue as well as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period. This was also partially driven by a decrease in revenue of approximately 5.4 million from the South Texas Family Residential Center led by the STFRC Contract termination as previously discussed. Adjusted gross profit decreased as a result of the decrease in revenue mentioned above, partially offset by lower costs due to operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC Community, including lease terminations as a result of the purchase of certain previously leased equipment. This was also partially offset by a decrease in costs of approximately 2.4 million from the South Texas Family Residential Center led by the STFRC Contract termination previously discussed. HFS South Revenue for the HFS South segment was 38.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 37.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Adjusted gross profit for the HFS South segment was 12.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue of approximately 0.5 million was primarily attributable to an increase in customer activity. The decrease in adjusted gross profit of approximately (1.7) million was primarily attributable to an increase in operational costs to support increased customer demand. Segment Results The following table sets forth our selected results of operations for each of our reportable segments and All Other for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in thousands, except for Average Daily Rate). 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Amount of Increase Percentage Change Increase 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenue: Government 180,948 316,223 (135,275) (43) HFS - South 113,198 112,452 746 1 All Other 8,438 8,713 (275) (3) Total Revenues 302,584 437,388 (134,804) (31) Adjusted Gross Profit Government 147,556 266,825 (119,269) (45) HFS - South 38,241 39,028 (787) (2) All Other (1,006) (1,526) 520 (34) Total Adjusted Gross Profit 184,791 304,327 (119,536) (39) Average Daily Rate HFS - South 74.04 74.80 (0.76) Note: Adjusted gross profit for the chief operating decision maker s CODM analysis includes the services and rental costs recognized in the financial statements and excludes depreciation on specialty rental assets, certain severance costs, and loss on impairment. Average daily rate is calculated based on specialty rental income and services income received over the period indicated, divided by utilized bed nights. Government Revenue for the Government segment was 180.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 316.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted gross profit for the Government segment was 147.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 266.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue decreased primarily due to the decrease in the non-cash revenue amortization that ended in November 2023 associated with the advanced payment from the prior Expanded Humanitarian Contract that expired on November 15, 2023 and partially by lower minimum lease revenue as well as lower variable services revenue generated by the New PCC contract in the current period. This was also partially driven by a decrease in revenue of approximately 3.5 million from the South Texas Family Residential Center led by the STFRC Contract termination as previously discussed. Adjusted gross profit decreased as a result of the decrease in revenue mentioned above, partially offset by lower costs due to operational efficiencies and reduced leasing costs associated with certain leases that were terminated at the PCC

 Community, including lease terminations as a result of the purchase of certain previously leased equipment. This was also partially offset by a decrease in costs of approximately 1 million from the South Texas Family Residential Center led by the STFRC Contract termination previously discussed. HFS South Revenue for the HFS South segment was 113.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 112.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted gross profit for the HFS South segment was 38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 39.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue of 0.7 million was primarily attributable to an increase in customer activity, which led to more communities in operation during the current period, including a new community acquired in January 2023 to support growth in the HFS South segment. The decrease in adjusted gross profit of (0.8) million was primarily attributable to an increase in operational costs from community expansion to support increased customer demand, partially offset by a decrease in service costs driven by the prior period including asset mobilization and integration costs associated with the new community acquired in January 2023 that didn t recur in the current period and by operational efficiencies achieved in the current period. The increase in revenue noted above also partially offset this decrease. Liquidity and Capital Resources We depend on cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our ABL Facility to finance our acquisition strategy, working capital needs, and capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, the ABL Facility had unused available borrowing capacity of 175 million. We currently believe that our cash on hand, along with these sources of funds will provide sufficient liquidity to fund debt service requirements, support our growth, acquisition, and diversification strategy discussed in Item 1, Business of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, lease obligations, contingent liabilities and working capital investments for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain future debt or equity financings adequate for our future cash requirements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient, we may be forced to reduce or delay additional acquisitions, future investments and capital expenditures, and seek additional capital. Significant delays in our ability to finance planned acquisitions or capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. We continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that any such acquisition may require us to incur additional debt to finance the acquisition and/or to issue shares of our Common Stock or other equity securities as acquisition consideration or as part of an overall financing plan. We will continue to evaluate alternatives to optimize our capital structure, which could include the issuance or repurchase of unsecured and secured debt, equity securities and/or equity-linked securities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance or repurchase. From time to time, we may also seek to streamline our capital structure and improve our financial position through refinancing or restructuring our existing debt or retiring certain of our securities for cash or other consideration. Capital Requirements During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred approximately 28.1 million in capital expenditures, with approximately 14.3 million driven by capital expenditures in the Government segment. Maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental assets amounted to approximately 18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As we pursue growth, we monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the ability to maintain existing contracts, obtain new contracts and manage our operating expenses. The failure to achieve anticipated revenue and cash flows from operations could result in a

Table of Contents 
 reduction in future capital spending. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event we make additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures or seek additional capital. We cannot assure you that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The following table sets forth general information derived from our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows: 

For the Nine Months Ended in thousands) September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 121,123 118,512 Net cash used in investing activities (23,421) (60,909) Net cash used in financing activities (23,879) (134,177) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5) 5 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 73,818 (76,569) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 Cash flows provided by operating activities . Net cash provided by operating activities was 121.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 118.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current period is up by approximately 2.6 million when compared to 2023 driven by an increase in cash collections from customers of approximately 2.5 million, and a net decrease in payments for operating expenses and payroll of approximately 9.7 million driven by a decrease of approximately 3.9 million in cash payments for the vested SAR awards, and by a decrease in operating expenses led by the Government segment, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for severance, and an increase in cash paid for audit and other professional fees. There was also an increase in interest received by approximately 2.3 million (driven by a higher average outstanding cash balance in the current period that generated interest income), and a decrease in cash paid for interest during the period of approximately 8.7 million driven by lower debt as a result of a decrease in the outstanding balance of the Senior Secured Notes. These increases in net cash flows from operations were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes of approximately 20.5 million as our United States federal tax loss carryforward deductions were fully utilized during the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash flows used in investing activities . Net cash used in investing activities was 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to a decrease in growth capital expenditures in the HFS South segment with the largest single driver being the 18.6 million acquisition of community assets and related intangibles in January 2023, supporting continued customer demand. To a lesser extent, the decrease was related to a 5.0 million acquisition of community assets in April 2023 and 1.3 million worth of land acquisitions during the three months ended September 30, 2023, supporting Government segment growth. The remainder of the decrease was driven by a decrease in other growth capital expenditures in the Government segment as the prior period included expansion related activities associated with the Expanded PCC Community contract that became effective on May 16, 2022 and drove a significant amount of capital expenditure spend into 2023. Cash flows used in financing activities . Net cash used in financing activities was 23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 134.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the 125 million partial redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes on March 15, 2023 combined with the prior period including the payment of deferred financing costs of 1.4 million associated with the ABL Facility amendment, payment of accrued issuance costs from the warrant exchange of 1.5 million that closed in December of 2022, and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of approximately 6.8 million, partially offset by the current period increase in net cash used in financing activities of approximately 21.9 million for the repurchase of Common Stock as part of the share repurchase program, combined with taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of 2.6 million in the current period.

 Indebtedness Finance lease and other financing obligations The Company s finance lease and other financing obligations as of September 30, 2024 consisted of approximately 2.5 million of finance leases. The finance leases pertain to leases entered into during 2017 through September 30, 2024, for commercial-use vehicles with 36-month terms (and continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter) expiring through 2027. The Company s finance lease and other financing obligations as of December 31, 2023 consisted of approximately 2.4 million of finance leases related to commercial-use vehicles with the same terms as described above. ABL Facility During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no amounts were drawn or repaid on the ABL Facility resulting in an outstanding balance of 0 as of September 30, 2024. The maturity date of the ABL Facility is February 1, 2028, which extended termination date is subject to a springing maturity that will accelerate the maturity of the ABL Facility if any of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity date thereof. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of the ABL Facility. Senior Secured Notes On March 15, 2019, Arrow Bidco issued 340 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes under the 2024 Notes Indenture by and among Arrow Bidco, the Note Guarantors, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and as collateral agent. Interest was payable semi-annually on September 15 and March 15 and began September 15, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made an elective repayment of approximately 5.5 million on the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, reducing the principal balance outstanding to 334.5 million from an original principal balance of 340 million. On March 15, 2023, Arrow Bidco redeemed 125 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes. In connection with the Notes Exchange Offer (as defined in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K), on November 1, 2023, approximately 181.4 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes were exchanged by Arrow Bidco and Arrow Bidco issued approximately 181.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture by and among Arrow Bidco, the guarantors from time to time party thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and collateral agent. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, and began on March 15, 2024. Following this issuance and related transactions, approximately 28.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes remained outstanding, which were subsequently redeemed on November 21, 2023 resulting in an outstanding balance of 0. As of September 30, 2024, none of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes had an outstanding principal balance of 181.4 million. Refer to Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Exchange Offer, and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Cash requirements We expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) and long-term needs for cash relating to our operations and obligations will be to primarily fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) maintenance and growth capital expenditures for specialty rental and other property, plant, and equipment assets, (iii) payments due under finance and operating leases, (iv) principal payments on the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, and (v) debt service interest payments. We plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of liquidity as previously discussed.

Concentration of Risks In the normal course of business, we grant credit to customers based on credit evaluations of their financial condition and generally require no collateral or other security. Major customers are defined as those individually comprising more than 10 of our revenues or accounts receivable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had two customers, who accounted for 47 and 13 of revenues, respectively, while no other customers accounted for more than 10 of revenues. The largest customers accounted for 31 and 10 of accounts receivable, respectively, while no other customers accounted for more than 10 of the accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024. Our largest customer for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 accounted for 63 of revenues, while no other customer accounted for more than 10 of revenues. The largest customer accounted for 21 of accounts receivable, respectively, while no other customers accounted for more than 10 of the accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2023. Major suppliers are defined as those individually comprising more than 10 of the annual goods purchased by the Company.

We provide services almost entirely to customers in the government and natural resource industries and as such, are almost entirely dependent upon the continued activity of such customers. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases certain land, buildings, offices, modular units, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases, the terms of which vary and generally contain renewal options. Such operating lease obligations are recognized in the Company s accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 as current portion of operating lease obligations and long-term operating lease obligations. Refer to the Company s unaudited consolidated balance sheet included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the amounts recognized as current portion of operating lease obligations and long-term operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2024. Rent expense included in services costs in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income for cancelable and non-cancelable leases was 9.6 million and 18.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rent expense included in services costs in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income for cancelable and non-cancelable leases was 2.9 million and 5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rent expense included in the selling, general, and administrative expenses in the unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income for cancelable and non-cancelable leases was 0.4 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles US GAAP ). For a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the judgments, assumptions and estimates upon which our critical accounting estimates are based. Additionally, refer to Note 1 of our notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for additional discussion of our summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates. These estimates require significant judgments and assumptions. Principles of Consolidation Refer to Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of principles of consolidation. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for our assessment of recently issued accounting standards. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have included Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows which are measurements not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, in the discussion of our financial results because they are key metrics used by management to assess financial performance. Our business is capital-intensive and these additional metrics allow management to further evaluate our operating performance. Target Hospitality defines Adjusted gross profit, as gross profit plus depreciation of specialty rental assets and loss on impairment, and certain severance costs. Target Hospitality defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation of specialty rental assets, and other depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what management considers transactions or events not related to its core business operations: Other expense (income), net: Other expense (income), net includes miscellaneous cash receipts, gains and losses on disposals of property, plant, and equipment, and other immaterial expenses and non-cash items. Transaction expenses: Target Hospitality incurred advisory fees associated with certain transactions during 2023. During 2024, Target Hospitality incurred expenses associated with certain transactions, primarily driven by the Proposal described in Recent Developments in Note 1 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Form 10-Q.

 Stock-based compensation: Charges associated with stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. Change in fair value of warrant liabilities: Non-cash change in estimated fair value of warrant liabilities. Other adjustments: System implementation costs, including non-cash amortization of capitalized system implementation costs, business development, accounting standard implementation costs and certain severance costs. 
 We define Discretionary cash flows as cash flows from operations less maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental assets. EBITDA reflects net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We believe that EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. We also use EBITDA, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company s capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. Target Hospitality also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of additional items, including certain items, that are not reflective of the ongoing operating results of Target Hospitality. In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude gains or losses on the sale or disposal of depreciable assets and impairment losses because including them in EBITDA is inconsistent with reporting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. Additionally, the gain or loss on sale or disposal of depreciable assets and impairment losses represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods, and depreciation is excluded from EBITDA. Target Hospitality also presents Discretionary cash flows because we believe it provides useful information regarding our business as more fully described below. Discretionary cash flows indicate the amount of cash available after maintenance capital expenditures for specialty rental assets for, among other things, investments in our existing business. Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows are not measurements of Target Hospitality s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to gross profit, net income or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of Target Hospitality s liquidity. Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows should not be considered as discretionary cash available to Target Hospitality to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that is available to it to meet our obligations. In addition, the measurement of Adjusted gross profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Discretionary cash flows may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our principal market risks are our exposure to interest rates and commodity risks. Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk through our ABL Facility, which is subject to the risk of higher interest charges associated with increases in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0 of outstanding floating-rate obligations under our credit facilities. These floating-rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term interest rates. If floating interest rates increased by 100 basis points, our consolidated interest expense would not be impacted, however, based on our floating-rate debt obligations, which had no outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024. Commodity Risk Commodity price fluctuations also indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term because they may affect production rates and investments by natural resource development companies in the development of commodity reserves. We have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. However, both our profitability and our cash flows are affected by volatility in commodity prices. We do not currently hedge our exposure to commodity prices. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s management and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, the majority of which arise out of the ordinary course of business. The nature of the Company s business is such that disputes occasionally arise with vendors including suppliers and subcontractors, and customers over contract specifications and contract interpretations among other things. The company assesses these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise. Reserves are established, as required, based on its assessment of exposure. We have insurance policies to cover general liability and workers compensation-related claims. In the opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under such pending lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties including unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of our legal proceedings could involve amounts that are different from our currently recorded accruals, and that such differences could be material.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within the Company s control and which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K includes a discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K. We depend on our most significant customer. The loss of our largest customer, or any one of our largest customers in any of our business segments, could adversely affect our results of operations. As a result of the previously announced termination of the contract for the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, we depend on our most significant customer. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our largest customer accounted for approximately 47 of our total revenue, and our five largest customers accounted for approximately 75 of our total revenue. For a more detailed explanation of our customers, see the Item 1. Business of our 2023 Form 10-K. The loss of our largest customer or any one of our largest customers in any of our business segments or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities The Company did not sell any securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On November 3, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 100 million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares, and the timing and exact amount of any repurchases will depend on various factors, including market pricing and conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations, and other factors. Any shares of common stock repurchased will be held as treasury shares. The Company may repurchase its shares in open market transactions from time to time or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with federal securities laws, at the Company's discretion. The repurchase program, which has no expiration date, may be increased, suspended, or terminated at any time. The program is expected to be implemented over the course of several years and is conducted subject to the covenants in the agreements governing the Company's indebtedness. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 2,424,440 shares of Common Stock for an aggregated price of approximately 22.3 million (exclusive of estimated excise taxes of approximately 0.1 million). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 150,000 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate price of approximately 1.1 million (exclusive of estimated excise taxes of less than 0.1 million). As of September 30, 2024, the stock repurchase program had a remaining capacity of approximately 77.7 million. The following table summarizes all of the share repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: 

Period Total number of shares Average price paid per share Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plan or program Maximum number of shares yet to be purchased under the plan (1) January 1, 2024 through January 31, 2024 903,444 9.37 903,444 9,465,382 February 1, 2024 through February 29, 2024 754,556 9.47 754,556 8,717,615 March 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024 616,440 8.89 616,440 7,259,287 September 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 150,000 7.61 150,000 9,995,668 Total 2,424,440 2,424,440
