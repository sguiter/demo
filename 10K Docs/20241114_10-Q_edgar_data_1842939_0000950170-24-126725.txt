as of December 31, 2023, which is classified as a component of assets available for sale in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost and amortized based on an economic benefit period, which is seven to twenty years. The Company evaluates finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by assessing the recoverability of these assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate indicate that expected undiscounted future cash flows related to such intangible assets may not be sufficient to support the net book value of such assets. An impairment charge is recognized in the period of identification to the extent the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the fair value of such asset. Costs billed to the Company as reimbursement for third parties patent submissions are considered to be license fees and are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets related to AxoBio are classified as a component of assets available for sale in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method using the following useful lives: Customer contracts

 Significant judgments required in assessing the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include the assumption the Company only has a single reporting unit, identifying whether events or changes in circumstances require an impairment assessment, estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount and growth rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and whether an impairment exists and, if so, the amount of that impairment. The Company has not recognized any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Deferred consideration is related to the Closing Cash Consideration of , that was payable upon delivery of the AxoBio 2022 audited financial statements. The 2022 audited financial statements were delivered in October 2023, and as such, the cash consideration was payable at December 31, 2023. In connection with the AxoBio Acquisition, the former stockholders of AxoBio were entitled to receive payment of the Earnout consisting of up to in cash and up to in shares of Common Stock, subject to the achievement of certain revenue targets and research and development milestones.

The Company estimated the fair value of the acquired inventories based on the selling price less costs to sell and recorded the fair value step-up of approximately at the Merger Closing Date. The fair value step-up is amortized over the expected realization term of one year from the Merger Closing Date. The acquired loan payable of AxoBio was adjusted down to its fair value by due to the more favorable than the market interest rate. This fair value step down is amortized over the term of the loan as a credit to the interest expense. The intangible assets include trade names, customer contracts and intellectual property. The intangible assets were valued using a discounted cash flow model. The estimated fair value of the customer contracts as of the acquisition date was determined based on the projected future profits from the contracts, discounted to present value, and the likelihood of contract renewals at the end of each contract term. The estimated fair value of the intellectual property as of the acquisition date was determined based on the estimated license royalty rates, the present value of future cash flows from the intellectual property, and the expected useful life of years. The estimated fair value of the trade name was determined based on the estimated royalty rates for the use of the trade name, the projected revenues attributable to the trade name discounted to present value and the expected useful life of years. The goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the AxoBio Acquisition are not deductible for U.S. tax purposes.

. The conversion feature within the Convertible Notes met the requirements to be treated as a derivative. Accordingly, the Company estimated the fair value of the Convertible Notes derivative using the Monte Carlo Method as of the date of issuance. The fair value of the derivative was determined to be at the time of issuance and was recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount. The derivative is revalued at the end of each reporting period, and any change in fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Proceeds from the sales of the Convertible Notes with Convertible Note Warrants were allocated to the two elements based on the relative fair value of the Convertible Notes without the warrants and the warrants themselves at the time of issuance. The total amount allocated to the Convertible Note Warrants was and accounted for as paid-in capital. The discount amount was calculated by determining the aggregate fair value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. On July 19, 2022, Carmell defaulted on the Convertible Notes.

Pursuant to this agreement, Alpha and Carmell each represented and warranted to Puritan that (i) it intended to enter into the Business Combination, (ii) there would be no conditions to closing relating to Alpha or its affiliates delivering a certain amount of cash to the Company at closing of the Business Combination, (iii) the only conditions to the closing of the Business Combination were as set forth in Sections 6.1 through Section 6.3 of the Business Combination Agreement, (iv) upon entering into such Business Combination Agreement, such parties would have a commitment letter from a third party to provide capital in an amount sufficient to the surviving company of the Business Combination to, among other things, repay all amounts due and owing at such time to Puritan at the closing, (v) the equity valuation ascribed to Carmell in the Business Combination Agreement was , and (vi) such Business Combination Agreement shall not place any restrictions on Puritan s ability to transfer any of its securities, including, without limitation, the shares underlying its Convertible Note Warrants. Carmell agreed it would not pay any other debtholder on account of interest or principal during the forbearance period. Based on the representations, warranties and agreements above and in consideration of Carmell s agreement to pay Puritan at the closing of the Business Combination (i) the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued interest, late fees and all other amounts then owed as specified in the Convertible Notes and (ii) freely tradeable shares of Common Stock (not subject to lock-up or any other restrictions on transfer) at a price of per share (i.e., the price per share of Common Stock to the equity holders of Carmell in the Business Combination), Puritan withdrew and rescinded the Notice of Acceleration, and such Notice of Acceleration was deemed null and void and had no further force or effect. Puritan further agreed that, based on the representations and warranties, and agreements contained in such agreement, it shall not issue any further notices of acceleration or default notices under the Convertible Notes, seek repayment of any amounts due under the Convertible Notes, or seek to exercise any other remedies contained in the Convertible Notes and other related agreements in regard to non-payment of the Convertible Notes from the date of the Notice of Acceleration until June 30, 2023.

Puritan calculated the cash amount of such repurchase to be . The Company believes that this calculation is inaccurate.

Puritan has also asserted damages in connection with the timing of the issuance to it of freely tradeable shares of Common Stock. The Company believes that it provided freely tradeable shares to Puritan at the same time as other Legacy Carmell stockholders.

Convertible Notes As detailed in Note 9, both Holders have provided notice to the Company demanding additional payment of principal and interest on the Convertible Notes in an approximate amount of per Holder at the closing of the Business Combination with additional interest thereon.

, Puritan filed a complaint captioned v. Carmell Regen Med Corporation et al ., No. 655566/2023 (New York Supreme Court, New York County) naming the Company as a defendant. In the complaint, Puritan asserts that the Company breached its obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Convertible Note Warrants. Puritan also asserts that the Company did not comply with its obligations to provide Puritan with freely tradeable shares of Common Stock in a timely manner. Puritan asserts claims for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, conversion, foreclosure of its security interest, replevin, unjust enrichment, and indemnification, and seeks remedies, including damages totaling through November 1, 2023, additional fees and interest thereafter, costs and attorney s fees, an order of foreclosure on its security interest, and other declaratory relief.

The following shares will be added (or added back) to the shares available for issuance under the 2023 Plan:	 Shares subject to 2009 Plan or 2023 Plan awards that expire, terminate or are canceled or forfeited for any reason after the effectiveness of the 2023 Plan; 

 Shares that after the effectiveness of the 2023 Plan are withheld to satisfy the exercise price of an option issued under the 2009 Plan or 2023 Plan; 

 Shares that after the effectiveness of the 2023 Plan are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to any award under the 2009 Plan or 2023 Plan; and 

 Shares that after the effectiveness of the 2023 Plan are subject to a stock appreciation right that are not delivered on exercise or settlement. 

 However, the total number of shares underlying 2009 Plan awards that may be recycled into the 2023 Plan pursuant to the above-described rules will not exceed the number of shares underlying 2009 Plan awards as of the effective date of the 2023 Plan (as adjusted to reflect the Business Combination). Shares of Common Stock issued through the assumption or substitution of awards in connection with a future acquisition of another entity will not reduce the shares available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. Warrant and Option Valuation The Company computes the fair value of warrants and options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term used for warrants and options issued to non-employees is the contractual life, and the expected term used for options issued to employees and directors is the estimated period that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company utilizes the simplified method to develop an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla grants for stock options. The Company utilizes an expected volatility figure based on a review of the historical volatilities over a period equivalent to the expected life of the instrument valued by similarly positioned public companies within its industry. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining term consistent with the expected term of the instrument being valued. The Company s stock price was derived from a 409A valuation prior to the Business Combination and market price for all options and warrants granted thereafter.

Overview Carmell is a bio-aesthetics company that utilizes the Carmell Secretome TM to support skin and hair health. The Carmell Secretome TM consists of a potent cocktail of proteins, peptides, and bio-lipids extracted from allogeneic human platelets sourced from U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved tissue banks. Over the past seven years, Carmell has extensively tested the technology underpinning the Carmell Secretome TM . Additionally, we have developed a novel microemulsion formulation that enables the delivery of lipophilic and hydrophilic ingredients without relying on the Foul Fourteen TM , which are 14 potentially harmful excipients that are commonly used by other companies to impart texture, stability, and other desirable physicochemical attributes to cosmetic products. W e are also developing a line of men s products and a line of topical haircare products. All of our cosmetic skincare and haircare products are tailored to meet the demanding technical requirements of professional care providers and discerning retail consumers. Our product pipeline also includes innovative regenerative bone and tissue healing products that are under development. We have completed the development of 12 products for our cometic skincare line and began to commercially launch them in 2024. We are employing an omnichannel distribution strategy and are selling our products online through direct e-commerce channels and through retailers in the United States. In addition, we have begun selling our doctor-dispensed products through dermatology and plastic surgery practices and medical aesthetics centers.

Following his resignation, Mr. Shukla continues to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. Other 2024 Developments For information on our material developments during the first half of 2024, are detailed in the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Impact of Macroeconomic Events Economic uncertainty in various global markets caused by political instability and conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, rising tensions in the Middle East, and economic challenges have led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital market instability, and supply chain interruptions, which have caused record inflation globally. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by further negative impacts on the global economy and capital markets resulting from these global economic conditions, particularly if such conditions are prolonged or worsen. Although, to date, our results of operations have not been materially impacted by these global economic and geopolitical conditions, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations may be impacted in the short and long term. The extent and duration of these market disruptions, whether as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the effects of the Russian sanctions, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, geopolitical tensions, inflation, or otherwise, are impossible to predict. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described or incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue expenses and net loss incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Going Concern and Management Plan The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities during the normal course of business. However, as of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,137,325, an accumulated deficit of 67,957,379 and liabilities of 6,506,411. We have incurred substantial recurring losses from continuing operations, have used, rather than provided, cash from our continuing operations and are dependent on additional financing to fund future operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We closed on the Private Placement in April 2024 and received gross proceeds of 3,001,235. Furthermore, we have refocused our efforts on cosmetic skincare products with near-term commercial potential, reprioritized further research and development, and ceased clinical studies of product candidates that will take more than a year to commercialize. We are also exploring raising additional capital, the development and commercialization of haircare products based on the Carmell Secretome TM , and the out-licensing of certain research and development programs to generate non-dilutive liquidity. Collectively, these activities are anticipated to assist us in extending our cash runway.

 Revenue/Gross Profit Gross revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 58,915 from sales of our first five cosmetic skincare products launched in 2024. We have developed an additional seven cosmetic skincare products that we expect to launch over the next six months. Discounts and allowances related to these sales totaled 38,396 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our net revenue, cost of goods sold, and gross profit on these sales were 20,519, 4,840 and 15,679, respectively. Operating Expenses Selling and marketing expenses totaled 120,062 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were driven by our marketing efforts related to our first five cosmetic skincare products launched in 2024. Research and development expenses decreased by 1,259,093 to 331,806 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease was driven by our strategic realignment, which refocused our efforts on cosmetic skincare products with near-term commercial potential, reprioritized further research and development, and ceased clinical studies of product candidates that would take more than a year to commercialize. Also contributing to the decrease was the termination of employees in non-core or overlapping business areas in the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. General and administrative expenses were 965,622 and 507,948 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in insurance costs and salaries and benefits for personnel. Restructuring charges of 726,280 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were related to the post-acquisition integration of AxoBio and consisted primarily of accrued severance from the termination of certain executives serving as part-time consultants and full-time employees in non-core areas or overlapping business functions. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net, were 1,458,692 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6,210,360 in the corresponding period of 2023. Other expenses, net, for the third quarter of 2024 were driven by an unfavorable change in the fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement of 1,420,137. The corresponding period of 2023 reflects an unfavorable change in the fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement of 10,592,442 and interest expense of 314,124. Such expenses were partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of derivative liabilities related to the Convertible Notes totaling 4,697,138.

 Revenue/Gross Profit Gross revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 71,235 from sales of our first five cosmetic skincare products launched in 2024. We have developed an additional seven cosmetic skincare products that we expect to launch over the next six months. Discounts and allowances related to these sales totaled 38,396 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our net revenue, cost of goods sold, and gross profit on these sales were 32,839, 5,132 and 27,707, respectively. Operating Expenses Selling and marketing expenses totaled 131,107 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were driven by the costs related to our marketing efforts for the launch of our cosmetic skincare products in 2024. Research and development expenses decreased by 2,289,589 to 865,292 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease was driven by our strategic realignment, which refocused our efforts on cosmetic skincare products with near-term commercial potential, reprioritized further research and development, and ceased clinical studies of product candidates that would take more than a year to commercialize. Also contributing to the decrease was the termination of employees in non-core or overlapping business areas in the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. General and administrative expenses were 2,957,890 and 1,655,846 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in insurance costs and salaries and benefits for personnel. Restructuring charges of 726,280 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were related to the post-acquisition integration of AxoBio and consist primarily of accrued severance from the termination of certain executives serving as part-time consultants and full-time employees in non-core areas or overlapping business functions. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net, were 5,744,560 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 10,585,772 in the corresponding period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expenses, net, were driven by an unfavorable change in the fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement of 5,700,451. The same period of 2023 includes an unfavorable change in the fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement of 10,592,442 and interest expense on debt of 845,158. These expenses were partially offset by a favorable change in the fair value of derivative liabilities related to the Convertible Notes of 826,980. Discontinued Operations, Net We had a loss from discontinued operations of 1,252,276, net of tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reflects the results of the AxoBio business through the closing of the AxoBio Disposition on March 26, 2024. There were no sales of AxoBio s products from October 2023 through the closing date of the AxoBio Disposition. The Company recognized a non-cash gain on the sale of AxoBio of 1,534,479 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due principally to the change in the fair value of the stock 

 29 

consideration between the AxoBio Acquisition and the AxoBio Disposition. See Note 1 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,137,325, an accumulated deficit of 67,957,379, and liabilities of 6,506,411. In addition, we had a net loss from continuing operations of 9,736,181 and negative cash flows from operations of 3,616,885 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Since our inception, we have financed operations principally through our issuances of equity securities and debt financing. In addition to the cost savings from the elimination of non-core areas or overlapping business functions in both the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 and the reduction of expenses resulting from the AxoBio Disposition, we have refocused our efforts on cosmetic skincare products with near-term commercial potential, reprioritized further research and development, and ceased clinical studies of product candidates that would take more than a year to commercialize. Late in the second quarter of 2024, we began the launch of our cosmetic skincare products based on the Carmell Secretome . Management anticipates that revenue from the commercialization of its cosmetic skincare products and the anticipated cost savings from the activities detailed above will assist us in extending our cash runway. In addition, we are exploring raising additional capital, the development and commercialization of haircare products based on the Carmell Secretome , and the out-licensing of certain research and development programs to enhance our liquidity. However, the cash available to us may not be sufficient to allow us to operate for the next 12 months due to our current and potential liabilities. We may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt issuances. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or will be completed on a timely basis. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern, the realization of assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty or that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Debt As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt totaling 362,967 (see Note 9 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). In the first quarter of 2024, the Board elected to repay all of the maturing Promissory Notes in shares of the Company s Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Promissory Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all of the Promissory Notes with an aggregate principal amount of 848,500 were repaid through the issuance of an aggregate of 328,707 shares of Common Stock. In addition, the Holders of the Convertible Notes have demanded additional payment of principal and interest on the Convertible Notes and certain payments with respect to the Convertible Note Warrants, as more fully described in Note 10 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our unaudited consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1,320,125 as compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by the cost reductions discussed above. Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 748,796 of costs in connection with the AxoBio Disposition.

Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 2,590,545 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11,935,234 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we closed the Private Placement, which provided net proceeds of 2,687,225. Financing activities in the same period of 2023 were driven by the proceeds of 30,951,174 from the Business Combination and 1,859,980 in proceeds from the issuance of debt and warrants, partially offset by the cash transferred in connection with the Forward Purchase Agreement of 17,535,632. In the 2023 period, we repaid 2,649,874 to the Holders of the Convertible Notes upon the closing of the Business Combination. Contingencies On November 8, 2023, Puritan filed a complaint captioned Puritan Partners LLC v. Carmell Regen Med Corporation et al., No. 655566/2023 (New York Supreme Court, New York County) naming the Company as defendant. In the complaint, Puritan asserts that the Company breached its obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Convertible Note Warrants. Puritan also asserts the Company did not comply with its obligations to provide Puritan with 25,000 freely tradeable shares of Common Stock on a timely basis. Puritan asserts claims for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, conversion, foreclosure of its security interest, replevin, unjust enrichment, and indemnification, and seeks remedies including damages totaling 2,725,000 through November 1, 2023, additional fees and interest thereafter, costs and attorney s fees, an order of foreclosure on its security interest, and other declaratory relief. The Company has moved to dismiss the complaint and intends to defend itself vigorously against this litigation. Contractual Obligations and Commitments In addition to financing obligations under our debt agreements, our contractual and commercial commitments include expenditures for operating leases and royalty payments. For further information on our Amended License Agreement with CMU, see Note 10 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. Although we qualify as an emerging growth company, we have elected not to opt-out of this provision and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards at the time private companies adopt the new or revised accounting standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to opt-out of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million, and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year, and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time that we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not required. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to the issue described below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management identified a material weakness in its internal controls over the accounting treatment for a complex transaction during the second quarter of 2024. We have addressed this weakness by adopting a policy requiring formal documentation to substantiate the accounting treatment of all material transactions, including references to the relevant authoritative guidance.
