in research and development expenses, while during the nine months ended September 30,
2023, the Company incurred . 

The
Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ASC 825-10 ), which permits entities to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. 

The
valuation of shares issued under an exemption from registration, such as under Rule 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, typically relates
to ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurement) under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). This accounting standard provides guidance
on how to measure fair value when required for financial reporting purposes. Among other notable considerations the Company highlights; 

When
 valuing shares in an exchange under Rule 3(a)(9), the conversion terms and the value of the
 securities being exchanged (debt, other equity, etc.) must be considered. If the company
 is offering a premium or discount as part of the exchange, this would impact the fair value
 measurement; 

Based
on Empirical Evidence and Studies, for restricted stock in public companies, the liquidity discount averages around 20 30 , based
on, but not limited to, the following data; 

Liquidity
 of the Security: 

If
 the company has low trading volumes and investors may find it difficult to sell shares, the
 discount could be on the higher end of the range (e.g., 30 40 ). 
 
 Conversely,
 for OTC companies with higher trading volumes, the discount might be lower (e.g., 10 20 ). 

Holding
 Period: 

The
 longer the restriction period on the newly issued shares, the higher the discount. If the
 shares are subject to extended holding periods, investors will require greater compensation
 for their inability to sell the shares in the short term. 
 
 For
 example, shares that are restricted for six months under SEC Rule 144 could see a 20 30 
 discount. If the holding period extends beyond that or other limitations apply, the discount
 might increase. 

Company
 Fundamentals and Risk 

Investors
 consider the financial health, stability, and growth prospects of the issuing company. A
 riskier OTC company with volatile financials or uncertain growth prospects might see a larger
 liquidity discount (e.g., closer to 40 ). 
 
 Companies
 with strong fundamentals might experience a lower discount (e.g., 10 20 ), even in
 the OTC market. 

In
accordance with the guidance of ASC 820 concerning for Lack of Registration Premium, shares that are restricted for six months under
SEC Rule 144 generally see a 20 30 discount on market price. The Company has opted for a discount to the market price at
the date of issuance based on the Company s elevated volatility, and to the illiquidity of the large amount of shares generally
issued in these transactions. 

In
contrary, shares issued under the registration requirements of the Securities Act for the Compensatory Benefit Plan pursuant to Rule
701 of the Securities Act where ASC 718 (Compensation Stock Compensation), are valued at market price at the grant date, based
on the limited amount of shares awarded, and its predictable repetitiveness. Under ASC 718, the grant date is typically the measurement
date for share-based compensation. This is the date when both parties (employer and employee) have a mutual understanding of the terms
of the award, and it is used to determine the fair value of the stock-based award for accounting purposes. The fair value measured at
the grant date is not adjusted for subsequent changes in stock price. 

The
new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled
in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted
method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2020, and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective
basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption
of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on the Company s financial statements. 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on the Company s unaudited condensed interim financial statements. 

and a negative working capital of ). The Company has not yet generated
any revenues, and has incurred cumulative net losses of . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised a net of in cash proceeds from equity and in cash proceeds
from the issuance of convertible notes. During the same period in 2023, the Company raised a net of in cash proceeds from equity.
The Company is aware that its current cash on hand will not be sufficient to fund its projected operating requirements through the month
of September 2024, and is pursuing alternative opportunities to funding. 

The
Company intends to raise additional capital through private placements of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that
these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development
activities or sustain operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement
a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back its current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised
to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. 

Accordingly,
the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates
continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not
necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and in 2023, there were in transactions with affiliates for license maintenance. 

The
Company had at September 30, 2024, loan agreements calling for an interest with two of its affiliates for a total value of 
with an accrued interest of . As at December 31, 2023, there was a loan for while there was interest due. 

impairment charges were recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Amortization
of capitalized patent costs associated with the application and award of patents in the U.S. and various other countries are capitalized
and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the patents as determined at the award date, which varies depending on the pendency

any time after the issue date of the Notes, the Holders of the Notes, (the 2021 Holders ), have the option to convert all
or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the 2021 Notes into shares of our Common
Stock at the Conversion Price.

If
the 2021 Notes are converted prior to us paying off such note, it would lead to substantial dilution to our shareholders as a result
of the conversion discounted applicable to the 2021 Notes. There can be no assurance that there will be any funds available to pay of
the 2021 Notes. If we fail to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, the 2021 Holders may convert the 2021 Notes and sell
the underlying shares, which may result in significant dilution to shareholders due to the conversion discount, as well as a significant
decrease in our stock price.

Stock of NDPD Pharma, Inc. NDPD ). NDPD, of which the Company s officers have beneficial ownership, had its assets
valued by an independent Accredited Senior Appraiser ASA in Business Valuations. NDPD s shareholders were offered
a stock purchase agreement, allowing them to sell of their Common Stock at the appraised value, to be paid by issuance of (i) 
shares of Bioxytran Common Stock to non-affiliates, and (ii) shares of Bioxytran Preferred Stock, to affiliates. The shares
were valued using the Volume-Weighted Average Price VWAP of the Company s Common shares as quoted on OTC Markets
as of the last trading day prior to October 1, 2024, (the Valuation Date the Preferred shares use the same price multiplied
by 5, which is the conversion rate of the Preferred shares into Bioxytran Common shares. The offer was accepted by all NDPD shareholders.

Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act.

Assumed value 

The
Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations . ASC 805 requires recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and
non-controlling interest in the acquired entity at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. This ASC also
requires the fair value of acquired in-process research and development IPR D to be recorded as intangibles with
indefinite lives, contingent consideration to be recorded on the acquisition date, and restructuring and acquisition-related deal costs
to be expensed as incurred. Any excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over purchase price and any subsequent changes in estimated
contingencies are to be recorded in earnings. In addition, changes in valuation allowance related to acquired deferred tax assets and
in acquired income tax position are to be recognized in earnings. 

Intangible
assets relate to the two patents WO2022099052A1 and WO2023178228A1 and to the License Agreement. The acquired definite-lived intangible
assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life, currently eighteen years, on a straight-line basis. The fair
value of the intangible assets was determined by using the income approach, which is a valuation technique that provides
the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful
life. Some of the significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows
for each year for each asset or product (including revenues and EBITDA), the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk
inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, and competitive
trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors. 

Goodwill ,
which is derived from the enhanced scientific expertise, and our ability to provide broader service solutions through a comprehensive
portfolio, is recorded based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not deductible
for tax purposes. In accordance with ASC 805-740, the Company established a deferred tax liability with an offset to goodwill in connection
with the accounting for the opening balance sheet of the NDPD acquisition as a result of book-to-tax differences primarily related to
the intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized but ASC 350 require instead that companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually.
Goodwill impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of goodwill (the amount at which it is recorded on the balance sheet)
to its fair value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited financial statements and the notes
thereto for the two years ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on March 22, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. These statements are often identified by the use of
words such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, intend, 
 could, estimate, or continue, and similar expressions or variations. Such forward-looking statements
are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially
from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments
will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we
have no current intention of doing so, except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking
statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

We
do not currently have sufficient capital resources to fund operations into the future. To stay in business and to continue the development
of our products, we will need to raise additional capital through public or private sales of our securities, debt financing or short-term
bank loans, or a combination of the foregoing. We believe that if we can raise 3,700,000, we will have sufficient working capital to
develop our business over the next approximately 15 months. At funding raised that is significantly less than 3,700,000, we can likely
continue to develop our business over the same 15-month period, but funding at that level will delay the development of our technology
and business. 

Bioxytran,
Inc. is headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts. The Company s initial product pipeline is focused on developing and commercializing
therapeutic molecules for stroke. The Acellular Oxygen Carrier AOC or BXT-25 will be designed to be an
injectable anti-necrosis drug specifically designed to treat a person immediately after they have suffered an ischemic stroke. The drug
is designed to be injected intravenously to travel to the lungs to pick up oxygen molecules to carry to the brain. Like a red blood cell,
we expect that the drug will cross the blood brain barrier, which is a protective semi-permeable membrane allowing some material to cross
but preventing others from crossing. BXT-25 will be designed to diffuse oxygen into the brain tissues. We expect the BXT-25 molecule
to be 5,000 times smaller than a red blood cell. 

On
December 2, 2022, India s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) issued an Investigational New Drug (an IND with permission to conduct: A Phase 1b/2a Randomized, Blinded, placebo-controlled Study in Participants with Mild to Moderate
COVID-19 to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of Orally Administered ProLectin-M . The study will continue by
filing an Emergency IND with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2024, provided we obtain adequate funding. An IND is currently under preparation
to be filed with the FDA in the third quarter of 2024. 

On
January 27, 2023, an additional IND with the CDSCO was issued for ProLectin-I for an IV treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients
with moderate Covid-19 infections and for Long Covid, and for ProLectin-F for treatment of lung-fibrosis as a result of use of ventilator
in treatment. 

On
April 19, 2023, the Company announced that its long-awaited Acellular Oxygen Carrier, has been successfully tested in animals. The initial
results are very encouraging because they show the non-toxicity of the experimental drug, along with the corresponding full recovery
in Swiss Albino mice, in an experiment carried out in a joint venture with NDPD Pharma, Inc. As a next step, the Company intends to proceed
with a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study using New Zealand Rabbits and Wistar Rats as funding permits. 

On
August 19, 2024, a Company affiliate exercised an option dated November 11, 2021 and exchanged 14,410,000 shares (49 in Pharmalectin
for 8,973,405 shares of Preferred Stock in Bioxytran. This exchange resulted in the Company owning 100 of the issued and outstanding
shares of Common stock of Pharmalectin. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
has limited resources and operating history. The Company currently has convertible loans outstanding at a total face value of 805,000.
As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 18,298,861 as at September
30, 2024. The accumulated deficit as at December 31, 2023, was 15,589,288. 

The
future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing to develop its new business opportunities and support the cost
of the drug development including clinical trials and regulatory submission to the FDA. 

Management
plans to seek additional capital through private placements and public offerings of its equity and/or debt securities. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives. Without such additional capital or the establishment of
strategic relationships with established pharmaceutical companies, the Company may be required to cease operations. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue operations.

Payroll
 and related expenses were 161,967 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 702,120 for the nine months ended September
 30, 2024. For the same periods in 2023, the amount was 375,588 and 1,128,259, respectively. The reduced cost is a result of
 the management teams 67 compensation cut for the remainder of 2024, or until the Company is listed on a major national stock exchange,
 whichever comes first.

 no claw-back was defined. 

Miscellaneous
 G A expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 44,465 and 128,079, respectively. During the
 three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 71,235 and 170,015. The decrease is based on a maintenance contract expensed
 in the 2 nd quarter of 2023.

As
 per the exchange terms in the Joint Venture Agreement dated November 15, 2020, an affiliate, of which the beneficial ownership includes
 the Company s officers, had the option to convert up to 15,000,000 shares in the Subsidiary into a 17.5 , or a pro-rated quantity
 thereof, ownership in the Company. On August 19, 2024, the affiliate exercised the option and exchanged 14,410,000 shares (49 in
 the subsidiary against 8,973,405 shares of Preferred Stock in Bioxytran. 

Upcoming
Financing Activities 

The
Company still struggles with a deflated stock price on OTC Markets which makes it very difficult to raise funds without heavily discounting
the price and diluting the shareholders. The Company is actively working on finding financing alternatives in order to continue its regulatory
approval activities. 

There
can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or will be sufficient to enable the Company
to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it
will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back its current business plan until
sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. 

COMMITMENTS 

We
have no current commitment from our officers and Directors or any of our shareholders, to supplement our operations or provide us with
financing in the future. If we are unable to raise additional capital from conventional sources and/or additional sales of stock in the
future, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. Even if we are able to continue our operations, the failure to obtain financing
could have a substantial adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the future, we may be required to seek additional capital
by selling debt or equity securities, selling assets, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance when we approach a condition
of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then shareholders.
We provide no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

25 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

In
presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters
that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. However, events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and,
as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current
conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We believe that
the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below
are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results.
However, the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we pay a fee for a service performed, and therefore the results
of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly
subjective, nor complex. 

Stock
Based Compensation 

The
Company has share-based compensation plans under which non-employees, consultants and suppliers may be granted restricted stock, as well
as options to purchase shares of Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost is
measured by the Company at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award over the requisite service period. 

The
Company applies ASC 718 for options, common stock and other equity-based grants to its employees and directors. ASC 718 requires measurement
of all employee equity-based payment awards using a fair-value method and recording of such expense in the consolidated financial statements
over the requisite service period. The fair value concepts have not changed significantly in ASC 718; however, in adopting this standard,
companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions. After assessing alternative valuation models and
amortization assumptions, the Company will continue using both the Black-Scholes valuation model and straight-line amortization of compensation
expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the grant. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

In
August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06,
Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates
the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies
the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard
also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s
own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for
all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2022, and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis,
with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of
AASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on the Company s financial statements.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) reviewed the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as at the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that as at September 30, 2024,
(i) the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the Commission ), and (ii) the Company s controls and procedures have not been designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

26 

Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as at the evaluation date that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company s internal
controls. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). A material weakness is
a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As
disclosed in our previous filings, there are material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting due
to the fact that the Company does not have an adequate process established to ensure appropriate levels of review of accounting and financial
reporting matters, which resulted in our closing process not identifying all required adjustments and disclosures in a timely fashion.
The Company s CEO/CFO has identified control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger
internal control environment. The small size of the Company s accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such
as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

Although
the Company has hired a consultant to assist with SEC reporting and accounting matters, we expect that the Company will need to hire
accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge to improve the levels of review of accounting and financial reporting matters. The
Company may experience delays in doing so and any such additional employees would require time and training to learn the Company s
business and operating processes and procedures. For the near-term future, until such personnel are in place, this will continue to constitute
a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that could result in material misstatements in the
Company s financial statements not being prevented or detected. 

Because
of the above material weakness, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO
revised in May 2013. 

No
Attestation Report by Independent Registered Accountant 

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, has not been audited by our independent registered
public accounting firm by virtue of our exemption from such requirement as a smaller reporting company. 

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

The
Company s management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent
or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur
or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls
can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation
of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
