The ESPP is available to U.S.-based employees and most of the Company s non-U.S.-based employees. The current offering period began on June 1, 2024 and will end on November 30, 2024. The Company expects the program to continue consecutively for six-month offering periods for the foreseeable future. Under the ESPP, eligible employees are able to acquire shares of the Company s common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions. The purchase price for shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP is of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock on (i) the first trading day of the applicable offering period and (ii) the last trading day of the applicable offering period. Employees are required to hold shares purchased for a minimum of six months following the purchase date.

 Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our audited financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Company Overview We are one of the industry s leading media effectiveness platforms that leverages AI to drive superior outcomes for global brands. By creating more effective, transparent ad transactions, we make the digital advertising ecosystem stronger, safer and more secure, thereby preserving the fair value exchange between buyers and sellers of digital media. Our software platform is integrated across the entire digital advertising ecosystem, including programmatic platforms, social media channels, and digital publishers. We deliver unique data analytics through our customer interface, DV Pinnacle, to provide detailed insights into our customers media performance on both direct and programmatic media buying platforms and across all key digital media channels, formats, and devices. In 2023, our coverage spanned 110 countries where our customers activate our services. Our customers include many of the largest global advertisers and digital ad platforms and publishers. We provide a consistent, cross-platform measurement standard across all major forms of digital media, making it easier for advertisers and supply-side customers to benchmark performance across all of their digital ads and optimize business outcomes in real-time. We derive revenue primarily from our advertiser customers based on the volume of media transactions, or ads, that our software platform measures Media Transactions Measured ). Advertisers utilize the DV Authentic Ad, our definitive metric of digital media quality, to evaluate the existence of fraud, brand safety, viewability and geography for each digital ad. Advertisers pay us an analysis fee Measured Transaction Fee per thousand impressions based on the volume of Media Transactions Measured on their behalf. The price of most of our solutions is fixed. On platforms that charge based on percent of media spend, our pricing includes caps which effectively mirror our standard fixed fees. We maintain an expansive set of direct integrations across the entire digital advertising ecosystem, including with leading programmatic, CTV, and social platforms, which enable us to deliver our metrics to the platforms where our customers buy ads. Further, our services are not reliant on any single source of impressions and we can service our customers as their digital advertising needs change. We generate revenue from supply-side customers based on monthly or annual contracts with minimum guarantees and tiered pricing when guarantees are met. Components of Our Results of Operations We manage our business operations and report our financial results in a single segment. Revenue Our customers use our solutions to measure the effectiveness of their digital advertisements. We generate revenue from our advertising customers based primarily on the volume of Media Transactions Measured on our software platform, and for supply-side customers, based on contracts with minimum guarantees or contracts that have tiered pricing after minimum guarantees are achieved. Our existing customer base has remained largely stable, and our gross revenue retention rate was over 95 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We define our gross revenue retention rate as the total prior period revenue earned from advertiser customers, less the portion of prior period revenue attributable to lost advertiser customers, divided by the total prior period revenue from advertiser customers, excluding a portion of our revenues that cannot be allocated to specific advertiser customers.

Table of Contents 
 For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we generated 92 of our revenue from advertiser customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we generated 91 and 92 of our revenue, respectively, from advertiser customers. Advertisers can purchase our services through programmatic and social media platforms to evaluate the quality of ad inventories before they are purchased, which we track as Activation revenue. Advertisers can also purchase our services to measure the quality and performance of ads after they are purchased directly from digital properties, including publishers and social media platforms, which we track as Measurement revenue. We generate the majority of our revenue from advertisers by charging a Measured Transaction Fee based on the volume of Media Transactions Measured on behalf of our customers. We recognize revenue from advertisers in the period in which we provide our measurement and activation solutions. For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we generated 8 of our revenue from supply-side customers who use our data analytics to validate the quality of their ad inventory and provide data to their customers to facilitate targeting and purchasing of digital ads, which we refer to as Supply-side revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, Supply-side revenue comprised 9 and 8 of revenue, respectively. We generate revenue for certain supply-side arrangements that include minimum guaranteed fees that reset monthly and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the access period, which is usually twelve months. For contracts that contain overages, once the minimum guaranteed amount is achieved, overages are recognized as earned over time based on a tiered pricing structure. The following table disaggregates revenue between advertiser customers, where revenue is generated based on number of ads measured and purchased for Activation or measured for Measurement, and Supply-side.

 Cost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) Cost of revenue increased by 3.0 million, or 11 , from 26.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 29.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to growth in Activation revenue, leading to higher partner costs from revenue-sharing arrangements. These were partially offset by savings from eliminating duplicative costs as the Company migrated to cloud services for better scale and flexibility, along with efficiencies gained from DV s AI-powered video classification technology. Cost of revenue increased by 5.6 million, or 7 , from 76.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 82.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to continued investments in cloud services to provide scale and flexibility necessary to support future growth, as well as growth in Activation revenue which drove increases in partner costs from revenue-sharing arrangements. Product Development Expenses Product development expenses increased by 7.0 million, or 22 , from 32.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 39.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, of 5.9 million, and an increase in third-party software costs and professional fees of 1.2 million primarily to support product development efforts. Product development expenses increased by 22.7 million, or 24 , from 92.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 115.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, of 18.8 million, and an increase in third-party software costs and professional fees of 4.0 million primarily to support product development efforts. Sales, Marketing and Customer Support Expenses Sales, marketing and customer support expenses increased by 7.6 million, or 23 , from 33.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 40.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation and sales commissions, of 6.0 million, and an increase in personnel travel and entertainment expenses to support marketing and sales activities of 0.4 million. Sales, marketing and customer support expenses increased by 33.0 million, or 37 , from 90.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 123.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased by 0.8 million, or 7 , from 10.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 11.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software development costs and an increase in intangible assets related to the acquisition of Scibids. Depreciation and amortization increased by 4.1 million, or 14 , from 29.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 33.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software development costs and an increase in intangible assets related to the acquisition of Scibids. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by 0.1 million, from 0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense was materially unchanged at 0.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 0.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other Income, Net Other income, net increased by 2.6 million, from income of 1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to income of 4.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on interest-bearing monetary assets, and gains from changes in foreign exchange rates. Other income, net increased by 1.7 million, from income of 6.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to income of 8.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on interest-bearing monetary assets, partially offset by an increase in losses from changes in foreign exchange rates. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased by 5.2 million from a 6.2 million expense in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to a 11.4 million expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a shortfall in share-based compensation as well as other permanent book-to-tax income adjustments. A shortfall exists when there is a deficiency between the deferred tax asset recorded upon issuance of shares and the actual tax benefit recognized upon settlement. Income tax expense increased by 2.8 million from a 15.8 million expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a 18.6 million expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a shortfall in share-based compensation as well as other permanent book-to-tax income adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, are useful in evaluating our business. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(d) Other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 consist of interest income earned on interest-bearing monetary assets, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as measures of operational efficiency to understand and evaluate our core business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors for period to period comparisons of our core business and for understanding and evaluating trends in operating results on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these measures are: they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay income taxes; they do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal debt payments; and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges related mainly to intangible assets, certain assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
 In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently, therefore limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our operations are financed primarily through cash generated from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 311.9 million and net working capital, consisting of current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) less current liabilities, of 179.4 million.

 We believe existing cash and cash generated from operations, together with the 200.0 million undrawn balance under the New Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short-term and long-term basis. Total future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those discussed above as well as the risks and uncertainties set forth under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Debt Obligations On August 12, 2024, the Company entered into the New Revolving Credit Facility with available borrowings of 200.0 million, which matures on August 12, 2029. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company is entitled to add one or more term loan facilities or revolving credit facilities and / or increase the amount of the revolving credit commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility. The New Revolving Credit Facility replaces in full the Company s Prior Revolving Credit Facility. All obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement. The New Revolving Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on, among other things: paying dividends or purchasing, redeeming or retiring capital stock; granting liens; incurring or guaranteeing additional debt; making investments and acquisitions; entering into transactions with affiliates; entering into any merger, consolidation or amalgamation or disposing of all or substantially all property or business; and disposing of property, including issuing capital stock. The New Revolving Credit Facility also requires us to remain in compliance with certain financial ratios, which will officially commence with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding debt under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

 On November 6, 2024, the Company announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 200.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock (the New Repurchase Program ), which amount is in addition to the initial Repurchase Program previously approved by the Board in May 2024. Under the New Repurchase Program, the Company may repurchase for cash from time to time shares of its common stock through open market purchases pursuant to Rule 10b-18 and/or Rule 10b5-1 plans, in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The New Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, has no time limit, and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time at the Company s discretion. As of November 6, 2024, 200.0 million remained available and authorized for repurchase under the New Repurchase Program. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Cash flows provided by operating activities 122,280 67,686 Cash flows used in investing activities (69,519) (79,549) Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities (50,277) 3,645 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 150 (389) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 2,634 (8,607) Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by growth in our operations and by changes in our working capital. In particular, trade receivables increase in conjunction with our rapid growth in sales and decrease based on timing of cash receipts from our customers. The timing of payments of trade payables also impacts our cash flows from operating activities. We typically pay suppliers in advance of collections from our customers. Our collection and payment cycles can vary from period to period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 122.3 million, attributable to net income of 32.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 93.8 million and 4.3 million use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 33.4 million in depreciation and amortization and 67.9 million in stock-based compensation, offset by 17.3 million in deferred taxes. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a 12.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due mainly to increases in prepayments, offset by a decrease in trade receivables of 10.3 million, and a 2.1 million decrease in trade payables, accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily related to the timing of income tax payments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was 67.7 million, attributable to net income of 38.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 65.5 million and 36.2 million use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 29.4 million in depreciation and amortization and 42.8 million in stock-based compensation, offset by 19.7 million in deferred taxes. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were a 35.2 million increase in trade receivables, prepaid assets and other assets due mainly to increases in sales and prepayments, and a 1.0 million decrease in trade payables, accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily related to income tax payments. Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 69.5 million, including 81.9 million attributable to investments in short-term financial instruments and 19.8 million attributable to purchases of property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software development costs, offset by 32.2 million attributable to proceeds from the maturity of short-term financial instruments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was 79.5 million, including 67.2 million attributable to the acquisition of Scibids and 12.3 million attributable to purchases of property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software development costs.

 Financing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities of 50.3 million was primarily due to 50.1 million related to shares repurchased under the Repurchase Program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities of 3.6 million was primarily due to 7.8 million proceeds from common stock issued upon exercise of stock options, offset by 3.7 million related to shares repurchased for settlement of employee tax withholding. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the dates of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any such differences may be material. Some of the judgments that management makes in applying its accounting estimates in these areas are discussed in Note 2 to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since the date of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.

 Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risks at September 30, 2024 have not materially changed from those discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding its required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management has implemented internal controls over significant processes specific to Scibids that we believe are appropriate in the integration of its operations, systems, and control activities. Scibids will be incorporated into our annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goal under all potential future conditions. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
