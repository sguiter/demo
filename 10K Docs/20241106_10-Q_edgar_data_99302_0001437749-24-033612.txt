 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

Under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we use judgments that could potentially impact both the timing of our satisfaction of performance obligations. Such judgments include considerations in determining our transaction prices and when our performance obligations are satisfied for our standard product sales that include general payment terms that are between net 30 and 90 days. 
 
 Revenue recognized from prior period performance obligations for the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 29, 2025 fiscal year 2025 was immaterial. As of September 28, 2024 , the Company had no unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of greater than one year. Pursuant to ASC Topic 606, the Company applied the practical expedient with respect to disclosure of the deferral and future expected timing of revenue recognition for transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. Deferred revenue, unbilled revenue and deferred contract costs recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2024 and March 30, 2024 were immaterial. See Note 4 for disaggregated revenue information.

 million and million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Transcat records foreign currency gains and losses on business transactions denominated in foreign currency. The net foreign currency was a net loss of million for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and a net gain of less than million for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 . The Company continually utilizes short-term foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that its future earnings denominated in Canadian dollars would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company does not apply hedge accounting and therefore the net change in the fair value of the contracts, which totaled a gain of less than million during ea ch of the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 , was recognized as a component of Interest and Other Expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying accounts receivables denominated in Canadian dollars being hedged. On September 28, 2024 , the Company had a foreign exchange contract, which matured in October 2024, outstanding in the notional amount of million. This contract was subsequently renewed and remains in place. The Company does not use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes. 
 
 per share ("common stock"), are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock reflect the assumed conversion of stock options, unvested restricted stock units using the treasury stock method and contingent consideration classified as equity in periods in which they have a dilutive effect. In computing the per share effect of assumed conversion, proceeds received from the exercise of options and unvested restricted stock units are considered to have been used to purchase shares of common stock at the average market prices during the period, and the resulting net additional shares of common stock are included in the calculation of average shares of common stock outstanding. 
 
 For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, the net additional common stock equivalents had a effect on the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the net additional common stock equivalents had effect on the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the first six months of each of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, the net additional common stock equivalents had a effect on the calculation of diluted earnings per share. The average shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows (amounts in thousands):

million through June 2026, with a letter of credit subfacility of million. The Company's 2018 term loan, with an original principal amount of million (the "2018 Term Loan"), is also provided for under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Credit Agreement allows the Company to use up to million under the revolving credit facility for acquisitions in any single fiscal year. The Credit Agreement restricts the Company's ability to complete acquisitions of businesses with a principal place of business located in the United Kingdom or the European Union to an aggregate purchase price of million during the term of the Credit Agreement, if the acquisition is financed directly or indirectly with the revolving credit facility. 
 
 Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may make restricted payments up to million in the aggregate over the term of the Credit Agreement and million in any single fiscal year to repurchase shares and pay dividends. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024 , million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility. As of September 28, 2024, there were amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024 , million was outstanding on the 2018 Term Loan, of which million was included in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the remainder included in long-term debt. The 2018 Term Loan requires total amortizing repayments (principal plus interest) of million per month through its maturity date in December 2025. 
 
 Interest and Other Costs: Effective July 1, 2023, interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue, at Transcat s election, at either the variable Daily Simple SOFR or a fixed rate for a designated period at the SOFR corresponding to such period (subject to a floor), in each case, plus a margin. Unused fees accrue based on the average daily amount of unused credit available on the revolving credit facility. Interest rate margins and unused fees are determined on a quarterly basis based upon the Company s calculated leverage ratio. The Company s interest rate for the revolving credit facility for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was . Interest on outstanding borrowings under the 2018 Term Loan accrue at a fixed rate of over the term of the loan. 
 
 Covenants: The Credit Agreement has certain covenants with which the Company must comply, including a fixed charge ratio covenant, which prohibits the Company's fixed charge ratio from being less than to 1.00, and a leverage ratio covenant, which prohibits the Company's leverage ratio from exceeding to 1.00. The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants and requirements during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 . The Company's leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, was at September 28, 2024 , compared with at March 30, 2024 . 
 
 Other Terms: The Company has pledged all of its U.S. tangible and intangible personal property, the equity interests of its U.S.-based subsidiaries, and a majority of the common stock of Transcat Canada Inc. as collateral security for the loans made under the revolving credit facility. 

million shares of common stock were available for future grant under the 2021 Plan. 
 
 The Company receives an excess tax benefit related to restricted stock vesting and stock options exercised and redeemed. The discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation and stock option activity during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024 were million and million, respectively. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units: The Company grants time-based and performance-based restricted stock units as a component of executive and key employee compensation. Expense for restricted stock unit grants is recognized on a straight-line basis for the service period of the stock award based upon fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of the restricted stock unit grants is the quoted market price for the Company s common stock on the date of grant. These restricted stock units are either time vested, or vest following the third fiscal year from the date of grant subject to cumulative diluted earnings per share or cumulative Adjusted EBITDA targets over the eligible period. 
 
 Compensation cost ultimately recognized for performance-based restricted stock units will equal the grant date fair market value of the unit that coincides with the actual outcome of the performance conditions. On an interim basis, the Company records compensation cost based on the estimated level of achievement of the performance conditions. The expense relating to the time vested restricted stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 
 
 The following table summarizes the non-vested restricted stock units outstanding as of September 28, 2024 (in thousands, except per unit data):

Total expense relating to restricted stock units, based on grant date fair value and the achievement criteria, was million and million in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024 , respectively. As of September 28, 2024 , unearned compensation, to be recognized over the grants respective service periods, totaled million based on estimated achievement levels as of September 28, 2024. If the maximum performance levels were achieved, the unearned compensation could be a maximum of million. 
 
 Stock Options: The Company grants stock options to employees and directors with an exercise price equal to the quoted market price of the Company s stock at the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula that requires assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the option. Expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each award. Options vest either immediately or over a period of up to five years using a straight-line basis and expire either five years or ten years from the date of grant. 
 
 We calculate the fair value of the stock options granted using the Black-Scholes model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value options granted during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024 : 

Volatility Factor 

Expected Term (in Years) 

Annual Dividend Rate 

We calculate expected volatility for stock options by taking an average of historical volatility over the expected term. The computation of expected term was determined based on safe harbor rules, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards and vesting schedules. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. We assume no expected dividends. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal year 2025 , the Company granted options for shares of common stock in the aggregate to Company employees that vest over three years. 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal year 2024 , the Company granted options for shares of common stock in the aggregate to Company employees that vest over three years, an option for shares of common stock to a Company employee that vests over five years and an option for shares of common stock to a Company director that vests over five years. 
 
 The expense related to all stock option awards was million in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and million in the first six months of fiscal year 2024 . 

The following table summarizes the Company s options as of and for the first six months ended September 28, 2024 (in thousands, except price per option data and years):

Outstanding as of September 28, 2024

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money stock options) that would have been received by the option holders had all holders exercised their options on September 28, 2024 . The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company s common stock. 
 
 Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options as of September 28, 2024 was million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of three years. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was million and during the first six months of fiscal year 2024 was million. Cash received from the exercise of options in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was million and during the first six months of fiscal year 2024 was million.

million consisting of up to million in cash and the issuance of our common stock valued at million. Pursuant to the Becnel agreement, the Company held back approximately million of the purchase price for certain potential post-closing adjustments. This includes million withheld for ordinary post-closing adjustments and million withheld that is subject to revenue target achievement. 
 
 Pursuant to the Becnel agreement, the purchase price is subject to reduction by million if certain revenue targets are not met through April 15, 2026. As of April 15, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration, classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, was approximately million and million, respectively.

Due to the uncertainty with utilizing these significant unobservable inputs for this Level 3 fair value measurement, materially higher or lower fair value measurements may be recognized at subsequent remeasurement periods. The stock portion of the contingent consideration is remeasured quarterly. If, as a result of the measurement, the value of the stock portion of the contingent consideration changes, any changes will be included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of shareholders equity.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 During our second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we had consolidated revenue of 67.8 million. This represented an increase of 5.0 million or 8.0 versus the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. This increase was primarily due to acquisitions, demand in our Service segment s highly-regulated end markets and increased rental sales, which includes incremental revenue from acquisitions. See Note 5 Business Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this report for more information about the impact of our acquisitions. 
 
 Our second quarter of fiscal year 2025 gross profit was 21.2 million. This was an increase of 1.1 million or 5.4 versus the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, consolidated gross margin was 31.3 , a decrease of 70 basis points versus the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. This decrease was due to lower margins from NEXA and Becnel. 
 
 Total operating expenses were 17.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, a decrease of 1.0 million or 5.5 when compared to the prior fiscal year second quarter. Included in operating expenses during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were incremental operating expenses from the acquisitions of Becnel, Axiom and SteriQual, investments in technology and higher incentive-based employee costs due to higher sales. Included in operating expenses during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was a 2.8 million non-cash charge related to the amended NEXA earn-out agreement. As a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses were 25.8 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, down 360 basis points from 29.4 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Operating income was 3.7 million, an increase of 2.1 million, or 127.3 and operating margin increased from 2.6 to 5.5 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. 
 
 Net income was 3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 versus 0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher operating income and lower interest expense.

Total revenue was 67.8 million, an increase of 5.0 million, or 8.0 , in our fiscal year 2025 second quarter compared to the prior fiscal year second quarter. 
 
 Service revenue, which accounted for 65.0 and 66.0 of our total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, increased 2.7 million or 6.4 from the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 to the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. This year-over-year increase included 0.8 million in revenue from the acquisition of Becnel, and also included organic revenue growth of 4.4 driven by end-market demand and continued market share gains.

The lower growth in Service revenue during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily due to a decline in our NEXA cost control and optimization services business as compared to the prior year quarter. We expect to fully integrate NEXA s sales and marketing into our existing process to drive anticipated revenue growth. Within any fiscal year, while we add new customers, we also have customers from the prior fiscal year whose service orders may not repeat for any number of factors. Among those factors are variations in the timing of periodic calibrations and other services, customer capital expenditures and customer outsourcing decisions. Because the timing of Service segment orders can vary on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we believe trailing twelve-month information provides a better indication of the progress of this segment. 
 
 The following table presents the trailing twelve-month Service segment revenue for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2025 and each quarter in fiscal year 2024 as well as the trailing twelve-month revenue growth as a comparison to that of the prior fiscal year period:

Our strategy has been to focus our investments in the core electrical, temperature, pressure, physical/dimensional and radio frequency/microwave calibration disciplines. We expect to subcontract approximately 13 to 15 of our Service revenue to third-party vendors for calibration beyond our chosen scope of capabilities. We continually evaluate our outsourcing needs and make capital investments, as deemed necessary, to add more in-house capabilities and reduce the need for third-party vendors. Capability expansion through business acquisitions is another way that we seek to reduce the need for outsourcing.

Our Distribution revenue accounted for 35.0 of our total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 and 34.0 of our total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, Distribution segment revenue was 23.7 million which was an increase of 2.3 million or 11.1 . This increase was due to 2.0 million of incremental revenue from the acquisitions of Axiom and Becnel, incremental rental revenue, offset by slower demand for our non-rental products.

The Distribution segment revenue increase for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 versus the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was due to revenue from the acquisitions of Axiom and Becnel and increases in traditional rental products. 
 
 Distribution revenue orders include orders for instruments that we routinely stock in our inventory, customized products, and other products ordered less frequently, which we do not stock. Product backorders are the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Pending product shipments are primarily backorders, but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our service centers prior to shipment, orders required by the customer to be shipped complete or at a future date, and other orders awaiting final credit or management review prior to shipment. Management uses pending product shipments and backorders as measures of our future business performance and financial performance within the distribution segment.

Total operating expenses were 17.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 versus 18.5 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The year-over-year increase in selling, marketing and warehouse expenses is due to increased expenses related to recent acquisitions and higher incentive-based employee costs due to higher sales. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to the reduction in the non-cash charge related to the NEXA earn-out in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 offset by incremental expenses related to acquired companies, increased payroll costs for new employees and continued investments in technology.

Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was 11.5 and 42.6 , respectively. The tax provision is impacted by higher operating income and lower interest expense. The decrease in effective tax rate is due to the increase in our discrete items. Our quarterly provision for income taxes is affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from year to year. The discrete benefits related to share-based compensation activity in the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was 0.6 million and less than 0.1 million, respectively.

Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 increased from the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 primarily due to higher operating income and lower interest expense. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA: 
 
 Total Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 8.9 million, a decrease of 0.5 million or 5.0 versus the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a description of the non-GAAP measures we use and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 13.1 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 from 14.9 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by increases in operating income and depreciation and amortization expense, offset by the decrease in the NEXA earn-out adjustment.

This year-over-year increase included 2.2 million in revenue from the acquisitions of SteriQual and Becnel, and also included organic revenue growth of 5.4 driven by end-market demand and continued market share gains. 
 
 Distribution revenue, which accounted for 34.7 and 34.1 of our total revenue in the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, increased 4.6 million, or 10.8 , from the first six months of fiscal year 2024 to the first six months of fiscal year 2025. This year-over-year increase is primarily due to 3.8 million of incremental revenue from the acquisitions of Axiom and Becnel, and increases in rental revenue offset by slower demand for our non-rental products.

Total gross margin was 32.6 in the first six months of fiscal year 2025, up from 31.5 in the first six months of fiscal year 2024, a 110 basis point increase. This increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased revenue in our Service segment, which allows us to leverage our fixed costs, continued technician productivity improvements, and a favorable sales mix driven by increases in rental revenue in the Distribution segment.

Total operating expenses were 35.0 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 versus 32.6 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2024, an increase of 2.5 million or 7.6 . The year-over-year increase in selling, marketing and warehouse expenses is due to increased expenses related to recent acquisitions and higher incentive-based employee costs due to higher sales. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to the decrease in the non-cash charge related to the NEXA earn-out, offset by incremental expenses related to acquired companies, increased payroll costs for new employees and continued investments in technology. 
 
 As a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses were 26.0 in the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and 26.4 in the first six months of fiscal year 2024, a decrease of 40 basis points.

Our effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was 13.9 and 25.3 , respectively. The tax provision is impacted by higher operating income and lower interest expense. The decrease in effective tax rate is due to the increase in our discrete items. Our quarterly provision for income taxes is affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from year to year. The discrete benefits related to share-based compensation activity in the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was 1.1 million and 0.6 million, respectively.

Net income for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was 7.7 million, an increase of 4.3 million versus the first six months of fiscal year 2024. The year-over-year increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating income and lower interest expense, net. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA: 
 
 Total Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was 19.1 million, an increase of 1.3 million or 7.1 versus the first six months of fiscal year 2024. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a description of the non-GAAP measures we use and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by increases in operating income and depreciation and amortization expense offset by the reduction in the NEXA earn-out adjustment. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 14.2 for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 from 14.4 for the first six months of fiscal year 2024, driven by the reduction in the NEXA earn-out adjustment. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 In addition to reporting net income, a GAAP measure, we present Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition related transaction expenses, and other expense), which is a non-GAAP measure. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of our core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, stock-based compensation expense and other items, which is not always commensurate with the reporting period in which it is included. As such, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance when evaluating our business segments and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our credit worthiness. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 
 In addition to reporting Diluted Earnings Per Share, a GAAP measure, we present Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, acquisition related transaction expenses, acquisition related stock-based compensation and acquisition amortization of backlog; divided by the average diluted shares outstanding during the period), which is a non-GAAP measure. Our management believes Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is an important measure of our operating performance because it provides a basis for comparison of our business operations between current, past and future periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. 
 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute or alternative for the GAAP measure of Diluted Earnings Per Share and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We expect that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements will be met through cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. We believe that these sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements. 
 
 Under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company M T ), we have access to a revolving credit commitment (the Revolving Credit Commitment of 80.0 million through June 2026, with a letter of credit subfacility of 10.0 million. Our 2018 term loan, with an original principal amount of 15.0 million (the 2018 Term Loan ), is also provided for under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Credit Agreement allows us to use up to 50.0 million under the Revolving Credit Commitment for acquisitions in any single fiscal year. The Credit Agreement restricts our ability to complete acquisitions of businesses with a principal place of business located in the United Kingdom or the European Union to an aggregate purchase price of 40.0 million during the term of the Credit Agreement, if the acquisition is financed directly or indirectly with the Revolving Credit Commitment. Under the Credit Agreement, we may make restricted payments up to 25.0 million in the aggregate over the term of the Credit Agreement and 10.0 million in any single fiscal year to repurchase shares and pay dividends.

Table of Contents 

Effective July 1, 2023, interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrue, at our election, at either the variable Daily Simple SOFR or a fixed rate for a designated period at the SOFR corresponding to such period (subject to a 0.25 floor), in each case, plus a margin. Unused fees accrue based on the average daily amount of unused credit available on the revolving credit facility. Interest rate margins and unused fees are determined on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio. Our interest rate for the revolving credit facility for the first six months of fiscal year 2025 was 7.1 . Interest on outstanding borrowings under the 2018 Term Loan accrue at a fixed rate of 3.90 over the term of the loan. 
 
 The Credit Agreement has certain covenants with which we must comply, including a fixed charge ratio covenant, which prohibits our fixed charge coverage ratio from being less than 1.15 to 1.00, and a leverage ratio covenant, which prohibits our leverage ratio from exceeding 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with all loan covenants and requirements during the first six months of fiscal year 2025. Our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, was 0.08 at September 28, 2024, compared with 0.10 at March 30, 2024. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, 80.0 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility. As of September 28, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. During the first six months of fiscal year 2025 , we used 15.9 million, drawn from cash and cash equivalents on hand for a business acquisition. During the first six months of fiscal year 2024, we used 12.9 million, drawn from the revolving credit facility for business acquisitions. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, 3.0 million was outstanding on the 2018 Term Loan, of which 2.4 million was included in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the remainder included in long-term debt. The 2018 Term Loan requires total repayments (principal plus interest) of 0.2 million per month through December 2025.

Operating Activities : Net cash provided by operating activities was 15.8 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 compared to 16.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the first six months of fiscal year 2024. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of changes in net working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities). The significant working capital fluctuations were as follows: 

Receivables: Accounts receivable increased 1.2 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 inclusive of 3.1 million of accounts receivable acquired during the period. During the first six months of fiscal year 2024, accounts receivable decreased 0.3 million inclusive of 2.1 million of accounts receivable acquired during the period. The year-over-year variation reflects changes in the timing of collections.

Inventory: Our inventory strategy includes making appropriate large quantity, high dollar purchases with key manufacturers for various reasons, including maximizing on-hand availability of key products, expanding the number of SKUs stocked in anticipation of customer demand, reducing backorders for products with long lead times and optimizing vendor purchase and sales volume discounts. As a result, inventory levels may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of these large orders in relation to our quarter end. Our inventory balance decreased 1.9 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025. Our inventory balance decreased by 1.2 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2024 inclusive of 1.7 million of inventory acquired during the period. 

Accounts Payable: Changes in accounts payable may or may not correlate with changes in inventory balances at any given quarter end due to the timing of vendor payments for inventory, as well as the timing of payments for outsourced Service vendors and capital expenditures. Accounts payable increased 1.5 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2025. Accounts payable decreased 3.3 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2024. The variances are largely due to the timing of inventory and capital expenditures and other payments in the respective periods. 

Accrued Compensation and Other Current Liabilities: Accrued compensation and other current liabilities include, among other things, amounts paid to employees for non-equity performance-based compensation. At the end of any particular period, the amounts accrued for such compensation may vary due to many factors including changes in expected performance levels, the performance measurement period, and timing of payments to employees. During the first six months of fiscal year 2025, accrued compensation and other current liabilities decreased by 8.6 million, inclusive of 0.2 million from assumed liabilities, contingent consideration and purchase price holdbacks from acquisition transactions. During the first six months of fiscal year 2024, accrued compensation and other current liabilities increased by 3.1 million, inclusive of 3.5 million from assumed liabilities, contingent consideration and purchase price holdbacks from acquisition transactions. The change from the first six months of fiscal year 2024 was largely due to the inclusion of the acquisition related transactions, partially offset by the timing of income taxes paid. 

Investing Activities: During the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we invested 7.6 million and 5.4 million, respectively, in capital expenditures that was used primarily for customer-driven expansion of Service segment capabilities and our rental business. 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we used 15.9 million and 12.9 million, respectively, for business acquisitions. 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal year 2024, we paid 0.3 million of other holdbacks related to business acquisitions. 
 
 Financing Activities : During the first six months of fiscal year 2025, 0.8 million in cash was generated from the issuance of common stock. In addition, we used 1.2 million for scheduled repayments of our term loan and 3.0 million for the net awarding of certain share awards to cover employee tax-withholding obligations for share award and stock option activity in fiscal year 2025, which are shown as a repurchase of shares of our common stock. 
 
 During the first six months of fiscal year 2024, 5.3 million was borrowed from our revolving line of credit and 0.4 million in cash was generated from the issuance of common stock. In addition, we used 1.1 million for scheduled repayments of our term loan and 2.2 million for the net awarding of certain share awards to cover employee tax-withholding obligations for share award and stock option activity in fiscal year 2024, which are shown as a repurchase of shares of our common stock.

OUTLOOK 
 
 We are very proud of the consistent results the Transcat team has delivered year in and year out over an extended period of time. That said, it goes without saying we are disappointed with the NEXA-impacted aggregated results in fiscal year 2025 second quarter. We experienced isolated revenue challenges in the NEXA services channel in the quarter but believe the swift actions our team is already taking will rectify the situation as we continue to execute on our highly successful core growth strategy. 
 
 We expect fiscal year 2025 organic Service revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits when normalized for the extra week in fiscal 2024 and gross margin expansion. We anticipate a return to high single digit organic growth by the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. 
 
 Automation of our calibration processes and focus on productivity remain key enablers of margin expansion. We have demonstrated the ability to leverage these tools to improve our operational efficiency, which has become visible in our financial performance over time. 
 
 We continue to work our robust acquisition pipeline and are pleased with the potential flow of opportunities. 
 
 We expect our income tax rate to range between 21 and 23 for full fiscal year 2025. This estimate includes federal, various state, Canadian and Irish income taxes and reflects the discrete tax accounting associated with share-based payment awards.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 INTEREST RATES 
 
 Our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our borrowing activities. During the first six months of fiscal year 2025, we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In the event interest rates were to move by 1 , our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately 0.4 million assuming borrowings of approximately 40 million under our revolving credit facility. As of September 28, 2024, 80.0 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility. As of September 28, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As described above under Liquidity and Capital Resources, we also have a 15.0 million (original principal) term loan. The 2018 Term Loan is considered a fixed interest rate loan. As of September 28, 2024, 3.0 million was outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan and was included in long-term debt and current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 2018 Term Loan requires total (principal and interest) repayments of 0.2 million per month through December 2025. 
 
 Effective July 1, 2023, at our option, we may borrow from our revolving credit facility at the variable one-month Daily Simple SOFR or at a fixed rate for a designated period at the SOFR corresponding to such period (subject to a 0.25 floor), in each case, plus a margin. Our interest rate margin is determined on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio. Our interest rate during the first six months of fiscal year 2025 for our revolving credit facility was 7.1 . Interest on outstanding borrowings of the 2018 Term Loan accrued at a fixed rate of 3.90 over the term of the loan. On September 28, 2024, we had no hedging arrangements in place for our revolving credit facility to limit our exposure to movements in interest rates. 
 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY 
 
 Approximately 90 of our total revenues for each of the first six months of fiscal year 2025 and 2024 were denominated in U.S. dollars, with the remainder denominated in Canadian dollars and Euros. A 10 change in the value of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar and the Euro to the U.S. dollar would impact our revenue by approximately 1 . We monitor the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar and the Euro on a monthly basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in Canadian dollars or Euros as we believe to be appropriate. 
 
 We continually utilize short-term foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that future earnings denominated in Canadian dollars would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. We do not apply hedge accounting and therefore the net change in the fair value of the contracts, which totaled a loss of 0.1 million in both the first six months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, was recognized as a component of Interest and Other Expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The change in the fair value of the contracts is offset by the change in fair value on the underlying accounts receivables denominated in Canadian dollars being hedged. On September 28, 2024, we had a foreign exchange contract, which matured in October 2024, outstanding in the notional amount of 2.5 million. The foreign exchange contract was renewed in October 2024 and continues to be in place. We do not use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report (our second quarter of fiscal year 2025) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
