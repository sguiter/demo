year to up to years, including options to extend many of the leases. For leases with renewal periods at the Company s option, the Company determines the expected lease period based on whether the renewal of any options are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. Operating leases are accounted for on the balance sheet with the lease assets and liabilities recognized in Operating lease assets , Operating lease liabilities, current and Operating lease liabilities, net of current portion . Finance lease liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet in Obligations under finance leases, current and Obligations under finance leases, net of current portion . Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. All lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, we estimate incremental borrowing rates corresponding to the maturities of the leases. We estimate this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions, comparable company and credit analysis, and management judgment. Operating lease assets are initially measured based on the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, prepaid or deferred rent, and lease incentives. The operating lease liabilities are subsequently measured at the carrying amount of the lease liability adjusted for initial direct costs, prepaid or accrued lease payments, and lease incentives.

 Overview 
 GEN Restaurant Group is an Asian casual dining restaurant concept that offers an extensive menu of traditional Korean and Korean-American food, including high-quality meats, poultry, and seafood, all at a superior value. Founded in 2011 by two Korean immigrants, since the opening of our first restaurant in September 2011 we have grown to 43 company-owned restaurants located in California, Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas, New York, Washington, Oregon and Florida. as of October 31, 2024. Our restaurants have modern d cor, lively Korean pop music playing in the background and embedded grills in the center of each table. We believe we offer our customers a unique dining experience in which guests cook the majority of the food themselves, reducing the need for chefs and servers and providing a similar customer experience across the restaurants. 
 We expect to continue growing our number of restaurants in the future. Our new restaurants have generated average payback periods of approximately 1.4 years prior to the IPO. The projected average payback periods for new restaurants range from 2.0 to 2.5 years. Restaurants range in size from 4,500 to 12,000 square feet, and are typically located in high-activity commercial areas. 
 Business Trends 
 Our long-term growth strategy is to continue to open new restaurants in locations that we believe will achieve profitability levels consistent with our pre-pandemic experience. During 2023, we opened six new restaurants. Through October 2024, we opened six restaurants in Seattle, WA, Dallas, TX, Jacksonville, FL, Tigard, OR, Maui, HI and Pflugerville, TX. As of November 8, 2024 we have eighteen new restaurant locations with leases that have been signed, including four leases in Texas, three in Florida, two in New York, two in Massachusetts, and one each in the following states: Tennessee, California, Hawaii, Arizona, North Carolina, New Jersey and Illinois. We currently expect to open four additional restaurants during 2024. 
 Recent Events Concerning Our Financial Position 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022 we received 2.6 million in additional Economic Injury Disaster Loans, or EIDLs . There are no additional EIDLs expected. The EIDLs mature in 2050 and 2051, and carry an interest rate of 3.75 . The range of monthly payments under the EIDLs are from 700 to 9,770. As of September 30, 2024, the balance outstanding on the EIDLs was approximately 4.4 million. 
 On September 29, 2023, the Company entered into a 20 million line of credit with a bank. During September 2024, the Company extended the line of credit, which matures on September 25, 2025 and bears interest at a variable rate per annum equal to 
 23 

8.75 as of September 30, 2024. No amounts have been borrowed under the line of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a 3.0 million loan with a commercial bank. The loan matures on June 26, 2026 and bears interest at a variable rate per annum equal to 8.25 as of September 30, 2024. The balance was 2.7 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 We have received approximately 16.8 million in Restaurant Revitalization Fund, or RRF, grants. These grants were recognized as income as the money was spent, with 13.0 million recorded as income as of December 31, 2021, and 3.8 million was deferred as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 
 We assessed our long-lived assets for potential impairment each quarter with the result that no impairment charges were recorded in any of the periods presented. 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and performance measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing include Net Income Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Average Unit Volumes, comparable restaurant sales growth, the number of restaurant openings and revenue per square foot. 
 Net Income Margin 
 Net Income Margin is net income measured under GAAP divided by revenue. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, consulting fees paid to a related party, gain on extinguishments of debt, RRF grants, employee retention credits, litigation accruals, aborted deferred IPO costs written off, non-cash lease expense and non-cash lease expense included in pre-opening costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. For a discussion of why we consider these measures to be useful and their material risks and limitations, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 
 Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA is Income from operations plus adjustments to add-back the following expenses: depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs, general and administrative expenses, related party consulting fees, management fees and non-cash lease expense. Non-cash items such as charges for asset impairments and asset disposals are not included in Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin is the calculation of Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. For a discussion of why we consider these measures to be useful and their material risks and limitations, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 
 Average Unit Volume 
 Average Unit Volume or AUV means the average annual restaurant sales for all restaurants open for a full 12 months before the end of the period measured. AUV is calculated by dividing annual revenue for the year presented for all such restaurants by the total number of restaurants in that base. This measurement allows management to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base. 
 The following table shows the AUV for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 :

Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth 
 Comparable restaurant sales growth refers to the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. We include restaurants in the comparable restaurant base that have been in operation for at least 12 full months prior to the accounting period presented. Once a restaurant has been open 12 full months, it must have had continuous operations during both the current period and the prior year period being measured to remain a comparable restaurant. If operations were to be substantially impacted by unusual events that closed the location or significantly changed its capacity, that location is excluded from the comparable sales calculation until it has been operating continuously under normal conditions for both the current period and the prior year comparison period.

Since opening new restaurants is expected to be a significant component of our sales growth, comparable restaurant sales growth is only one measure of how we evaluate our performance. 
 Number of Restaurant Openings 
 The number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open new restaurants, we incur pre-opening costs. New restaurants may not be profitable, and their sales performance may not follow historical patterns. The number and timing of restaurant openings has had, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. We temporarily stopped opening new restaurants in 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but began openings again in 2022. The following table shows the change in our restaurant base for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

 Revenue Per Square Foot 
 Revenue per square foot means the restaurant sales for all restaurants opened a full 12 months before the end of the twelve month period measured divided by the average square footage of such restaurants. This measurement allows management to assess the effectiveness of our approach to real estate selection and the overall performance of our restaurant base. The following table shows the revenue per square foot for the twelve month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues. Revenues represent sales of food and beverages in restaurants and, to a minor extent, through our online portal. Restaurant revenues in a given period are directly impacted by the number of restaurants we operate, menu pricing, the number of customers visiting and comparable restaurant sales growth. 
 Food costs. Food costs are variable in nature, change with sales volume and are influenced by menu mix and subject to increases or decreases based upon fluctuations in commodity costs. Another important factor causing fluctuations in food costs includes restaurant management of food waste. Food costs are a substantial expense and are expected to grow proportionally as our sales grow. 
 25 

Payroll and benefits. Payroll and benefits include all restaurant-level management and hourly labor costs, including wages, employee benefits and payroll taxes. Similar to the food costs that we incur, labor and related expenses at our restaurants are expected to grow proportionally as our sales grow. Factors that influence fluctuations in our labor and related expenses include the volume of sales at our restaurants, minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, payroll rate increases due to labor shortages or inflationary pressures, the frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and healthcare costs. 
 Occupancy expenses. Occupancy expenses include rent, common area maintenance and taxes for all restaurant locations, but exclude any related pre-opening costs. 
 Operating expenses . Operating expenses include supplies, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other costs incurred directly at the restaurant level. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses . Depreciation and amortization expenses are periodic non-cash charges at our restaurants that consist of depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment, software and capitalized leasehold improvements. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives, ranging from five to ten years. 
 Pre-opening costs. Pre-opening costs include pre-opening period rent, maintenance, taxes, payroll and benefits costs, advertising and other expenses directly incurred by the new restaurant until the date of the restaurant opening. Pre-opening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of restaurant openings. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate management supervisory functions that support the operations of existing restaurants and development of new restaurants, including compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation, travel expenses, legal and professional fees, marketing costs, information systems, corporate office rent and other related corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expected to grow as our sales grow, including incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses incurred as a public company including becoming compliant with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley and addressing our internal control weaknesses through implementing new accounting systems and hiring additional staff. 
 Consulting fees related party.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results, as these measures depict normal recurring cash operating expenses essential to supporting the operations of our company. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to increase with the number of new restaurants we open and with comparable restaurant sales growth. 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted net income per share represents net income before income taxes, adjusted for stock-based compensation, and the related tax impact of the stock-based compensation adjustment, and provision for income taxes.

 As with Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, we believe that Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results, as these measures depict normal, recurring cash operating expenses essential to supporting the operations of our restaurants. We expect Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA to increase in proportion to the number of new restaurants we open and with our comparable restaurant sales growth. 
 However, you should be aware that Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin are financial measures that are not indicative of overall results for our company, and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of corporate-level and non-cash expenses excluded from such measures.

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the same fashion. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had 22.0 million of cash and (2.7) million of working capital, which is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, compared with 32.6 million in cash and 5.5 million of working capital as of December 31, 2023. On June 30, 2023, we completed the IPO of 4,140,000 shares of Class A common stock. The public offering prices of the shares sold in the IPO was 12.00 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately 46.2 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses payable by us. 
 Our primary uses of cash are for operational expenditures and capital investments, including new restaurants, costs incurred for restaurant remodels and restaurant equipment and fixtures. There is no guarantee that if we need to raise any additional capital that we will be able to do so. 
 Prior to the IPO certain companies within GEN Restaurant Group made distributions to their members, which impacted our cash position upon completion of the IPO. The operating agreements of most of the companies within GEN Restaurant Group, as separate private entities prior to the Transactions, mandate annual or quarterly distributions of available cash and/or tax distributions in an amount sufficient to allow members to pay taxes on income allocated to them. We determined the amount of these distributions based on the operating cash flow of each such entity. 
 We believe that cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 Upon consummation of the IPO, GEN Inc. became a holding company with no operations of its own. Accordingly, GEN Inc. is dependent on distributions from GEN LLC to pay its taxes, its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and other expenses. 
 33 

In connection with the Transactions, certain members of GEN LLC received the right to receive future payments pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The amount payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on an annual calculation of the reduction in our U.S. federal, state and local taxes resulting from the utilization of certain tax benefits resulting from sales and exchanges by certain members of GEN LLC. We expect that payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be substantial. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect that the reduction in tax payments for us associated with the federal, state and local tax benefits described above would aggregate to approximately 117.2 million through 2037. Under such scenario we would be required to pay certain members of GEN LLC 85 of such amount, or approximately 99.6 million through 2037. 
 The actual amounts may materially differ from these hypothetical amounts as potential future reductions in tax payments for us and Tax Receivable Agreement payments by us will be calculated using prevailing tax rates applicable to us over the life of the Tax Receivable Agreement and will be dependent on us generating sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit. 
 We cannot reasonably estimate future annual payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement given the difficulty in determining those estimates as they are dependent on a number of factors, including the extent of exchanges by continuing GEN LLC unitholders, the associated fair value of the underlying GEN LLC units at the time of those exchanges, the tax rates applicable, our future income, and the associated tax benefits that might be realized that would trigger a Tax Receivable Agreement payment requirement. 
 However, a significant portion of any potential future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is anticipated to be payable over 15 years, consistent with the period over which the associated tax deductions would be realized by GEN Inc., assuming GEN LLC generates sufficient income to utilize the deductions. If sufficient income is not generated by GEN LLC, the associated taxable income of GEN Inc. will be impacted and the associated tax benefits to be realized will be limited, thereby similarly reducing the associated Tax Receivable Agreement payments to be made. Given the length of time over which payments would be payable, the impact to liquidity in any single year may be greatly reduced. 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows, cash on hand and debt borrowings. We use these sources to fund expenditures for new restaurant openings, reinvest in our existing restaurants, and increase our working capital. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to guests the same day, or in the case of credit or debit card transactions, within several days of the related sale, and we typically have at least 30 days to pay our vendors. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.5 million, the result of net income of 5.9 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of depreciation and amortization of 5.0 million, amortization of operating lease assets of 5.4 million, stock-based compensation of 2.2 million and a reduction related to the gain on the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in GKBH. The net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were collectively a decrease of 4.2 million. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 13.5 million, the result of net income of 11.6 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of depreciation and amortization of 3.5 million, and amortization of operating lease assets of 3.5 million, and stock based compensation of 0.8 million, offset by net cash outflows of approximately 5.9 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable of 2.8 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of 2.0 million and an increase in operating lease liabilities of 2.5 million. 
 34 

Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.6 million, reflecting 16.7 million for the purchase of property and equipment and a 6.0 million payment for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in GKBH. 
 Net cash provided in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.4 million, reflecting 10.9 million in recovery of net proceeds from the advances made to a related party, partially offset by 9.5 million for the purchase of property and equipment. 
 Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.6 million, primarily due to proceeds from third party loans of 3.0 million, offset by payments to members and repayments of third party loans. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 6.1 million, primarily due to 46.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock issued in the IPO transaction, offset by 26.5 million in member distributions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 35 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition are based upon our financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 
 Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our financial statements and involve subjective or complex judgments by management. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, actual results may be materially different from the estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable. 
 Operating and Finance Leases 
 Our office leases provide for fixed minimum rent payments. Our restaurant leases provide for fixed minimum rent payments and some require additional contingent rent payments based upon sales in excess of specified thresholds. When achievement of such sales thresholds is deemed probable, contingent rent is accrued in proportion to the sales recognized in the period. For operating leases that include free-rent periods and rent escalation clauses, we recognize rent expense based on the straight-line method. For the purpose of calculating rent expenses under the straight-line method, the lease term commences on the date we obtain control of the property. Lease incentives used to fund leasehold improvements are recognized when earned and reduce the operating right-of-use asset related to the lease. These are amortized through the operating right-of-use asset as reductions of expense over the lease term. Restaurant lease expense is included in occupancy expenses, while office lease expense is included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying financial statements. 
 We currently lease all of our restaurant locations, corporate office, and some of the equipment used in our restaurants. On January 1, 2022, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or Topic 842 , using a modified retrospective approach. See "Note 10 Leases" to the financial statements. At commencement of the lease, we determine the appropriate classification as an operating lease or a finance lease. All of our restaurant and office leases are classified as operating leases and some of our equipment leases are classified as finance leases. 
 Assets we acquired under finance lease arrangements are recorded at the lower of the present value of future minimum lease payments or fair value of the assets at the inception of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or the lease term, and the amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization on the accompanying financial statements. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 We assess potential impairments of our long-lived assets, which includes property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 360 Property, Plant and Equipment. An impairment test is performed on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. In determining the recoverability of the asset value, an analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level. Assets are grouped at the individual restaurant-level for purposes of the impairment assessment because a restaurant represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to its estimated forecasted restaurant cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. Factors considered by us in estimating future cash flows include, but are not limited to: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets; and significant negative industry or economic trends. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. 
 No impairment loss was recognized during any of the periods presented. 
 36 

Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue, we have more than 700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. 
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 Please see Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Commodity and Food Price Risks 
 Our profitability is dependent on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverage and other commodities. We have been able to partially offset cost increases that have resulted from a number of factors, including market conditions, shortages or interruptions in supply due to weather or other conditions beyond our control and governmental regulations and inflation, by increasing our menu prices as well as making other operational adjustments that increase productivity. However, substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be offset by menu price increases or operational adjustments. 
 Inflation Risk 
 The primary areas where inflation impacts our operations are food, beverage, labor and energy costs. Our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage and other laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and tip credits. Significant numbers of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and/or state minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs. To the extent permitted by competition and the economy, we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed through to our guests. Historically, until 2022, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 While we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of core operating resources by gradually increasing menu prices, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our guests without any resulting change to their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate sales growth in an amount sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures. 
 37 

Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is exposed to market interest rates reflected in the line of credit which bears an interest rate at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus 0.25 . 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The material weaknesses related to (a) a lack of adequate and timely review of accounts and reconciliations by management, primarily due to a large number of accounting journal entries across GEN Restaurant Group's operating entities resulting in material audit adjustments and significant post-closing adjustments and (b) an inadequate design of our information technology controls and inadequate access by members of our finance team, primarily due to our accounting system's open architecture and a lack of segregation of duties within our finance team.
