The Company is also required to make mandatory prepayments in the event of (i) achieving certain excess cash flow criteria, including the achievement and maintenance of a specific leverage ratio, (ii) certain asset sales that are collateral, or (iii) upon the issuance, offering, or placement of new debt obligations. As described in Note 7 Leases , the Company received net cash proceeds in January 2023 from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction and is subject to a provision whereby such net cash proceeds can be reinvested into certain investments, such as capital expenditures. This provision of the Term Loan includes (i) cash investments made within a one-year period from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, and (ii) investments which are contractually committed within one-year of the Sale-Leaseback Transaction and paid within 180 days after entering into such contractual commitment.

 , and the interest rate on borrowings was revised to various spreads, based on the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio.

 The unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs were and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Debt discount and deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is an asset-based facility that is secured by a first lien on the working capital assets of the Company and a second lien on the non-working capital assets of the Company (including most of the Company s subsidiaries). The borrowing base is based on a detailed monthly calculation of the sum of (a) a percentage of the Eligible Accounts at such time, plus (b) the lesser of (i) a percentage of the Eligible Inventory, at such time, valued at the lower of cost or market value, determined on a first-in-first-out basis, and (ii) the product of a percentage multiplied by the Net Orderly Liquidation Value percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal ordered by the Administrative Agent multiplied by the Eligible Inventory, valued at the lower of cost or market value, determined on a first-in-first-out basis, minus (c) Reserves (each of the defined terms above, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility documents). 
 The Company is required to maintain certain reporting requirements, affirmative covenants and negative covenants, pursuant to terms outlined in the agreement. Additionally, if the Company s Excess Availability (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility documents) is less than an amount equal to of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment as of September 30, 2024), the Company will be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x on a rolling basis until the Excess Availability is more than of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment for thirty consecutive days. In order to consummate permitted acquisitions or to make restricted payments, the Company would be required to comply with a higher fixed charge coverage ratio of x, but no such acquisitions or payments are currently contemplated. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is in compliance with the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility provides for various interest rate options including the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate, the CB Floating Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR, or the CBFR. The rates that use SOFR as the reference rate (Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR and the CBFR rate) use the Term SOFR Rate plus . Each rate has a floor. A fee of per annum is charged for available but unused borrowings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had borrowed under the facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company would be able to borrow approximately million under the Revolving Credit Facility, before the Company would be required to comply with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x. 
 Other Debt 
 Other debt of and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, was primarily comprised of a foreign subsidiary's other debt which constitutes an immaterial revolving line of credit and mortgage.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. You should read this analysis in conjunction with our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance. Actual events or results may differ materially from forward-looking statements. In evaluating such statements, you should carefully consider the various factors identified in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements, including those set forth in Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Company Overview 
 We are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of branded hydroponics equipment and supplies for controlled environment agriculture ("CEA"), including grow lights, climate control solutions, growing media and nutrients, as well as a broad portfolio of innovative and proprietary branded products. We primarily serve the U.S. and Canadian markets, and believe we are one of the leading companies in these markets in an otherwise fragmented industry. For over 40 years, we have helped growers make growing easier and more productive. Our mission is to empower growers, farmers and cultivators with products that enable greater quality, efficiency, consistency, and speed in their grow projects. 
 Hydroponics is the farming of plants using soilless growing media and often artificial lighting in a controlled indoor or greenhouse environment. Hydroponics is the primary category of CEA and we use the terms CEA and hydroponics interchangeably. Our products are used to grow, farm, and cultivate cannabis, flowers, fruits, plants, vegetables, grains and herbs in controlled environment settings that allow end users to control key farming variables including temperature, humidity, CO 2 , light intensity spectrum, nutrient concentration and pH. Through CEA, growers are able to be more efficient with physical space, water and resources, while enjoying year-round and more rapid grow cycles as well as more predictable and abundant grow yields, when compared to other traditional growing methods. 
 We reach commercial farmers and consumers through a broad and diversified network of over 2,000 wholesale customer accounts, who we connect with primarily through our proprietary online ordering platform. Our products are distributed across the United States and Canada through a diversified range of retailers of commercial and home gardening equipment and supplies. Our customers include specialty hydroponic retailers, commercial resellers and greenhouse builders, garden centers, hardware stores, and e-commerce retailers. Specialty hydroponic retailers can provide growers with specialized merchandise assortments and knowledgeable staff. 
 Market Conditions 
 We have experienced adverse financial results which we believe is primarily a result of an agricultural oversupply impacting our market and resulting in a decrease in indoor and outdoor cultivation. The extent these market conditions will continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations is uncertain and difficult to predict at this time. We believe COVID-19 may have provided a positive demand impact for the Company in 2020 and 2021 from shelter-in-place orders in the United States, a possible negative supply chain impact from workforce disruption at international and domestic suppliers, and a possible negative growth rate impact in 2022 and 2023 due to agricultural oversupply initiated during the height of COVID-related shelter-in-place orders in 2020 and 2021. 
 In 2022, we undertook the following major initiatives in connection the first phase of our previously disclosed restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan"): (i) narrowing our product and brand portfolio, including removing approximately one-third of all products and one-fifth of all brands relating to our primary product portfolio, which excluded our garden center business in Canada, and (ii) relocating and consolidating certain manufacturing and distribution centers, including headcount reductions and reorganization to drive a solution based approach, focusing commercial sales on competencies and product assortment gained from our recent acquisitions. Total costs incurred relating to this first phase of the Restructuring Plan from its commencement in 2022 to its completion in 2023, were (i) 6.4 million relating primarily to inventory markdowns, and (ii) 3.4 million relating primarily to the relocation and termination of certain facilities in Canada. 
 As a result of the continued adverse market conditions, in the third quarter of 2023 we began a second phase of the Restructuring Plan which included U.S. manufacturing facility consolidations, in particular with respect to our production of certain durable equipment products. In 2023, we recorded 9.2 million of restructuring charges for the second phase. These charges primarily related to estimated non-cash raw material inventory write-downs as we reduced our capacity and facility

 space, given the change in customer demand for these products. These restructuring charges were primarily recorded within Cost of goods sold on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 In 2024, we evaluated alternatives to maximize the recovery value of our assets and the cost structure associated with manufacturing our IGE branded durable equipment products. In the second quarter of 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with the Buyer to sell the inventories, and property, plant and equipment associated with our IGE branded products for approximately 8.7 million, while retaining our proprietary brand and customer relationships. In connection with the Asset Sale, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with the Buyer, pursuant to which the Buyer provides contract manufacturing and we continue to sell our proprietary branded durable products, which include horticulture benches, racking and LED lighting systems. As a result of the Asset Sale and new contract manufacturing arrangement, we expect improved profitability on future IGE branded product sales from an anticipated decrease in fixed costs. The Asset Sale closed on May 31, 2024 and we sold or disposed of approximately 11.6 million of inventories, 3.7 million of property, plant and equipment, and technology intangible assets of 2.6 million. In connection with the Asset Sale, we terminated and paid-off the facility operating lease for 1.3 million and certain equipment finance leases for 0.7 million. We recorded a loss on asset disposition of approximately 11.5 million on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to execute further restructuring actions, including consolidation of other U.S. manufacturing facilities, and outsourcing certain distribution center locations to reduce costs and further consolidate our facility footprint. These actions resulted in restructuring charges of 0.7 million and 1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, including termination and disposal costs associated with inventory, facilities and headcount reductions. After completion of the Asset Sale and the aforementioned restructuring actions, we have now consolidated our manufacturing operations into two U.S. locations and our peat moss harvesting and processing operation in Canada. We are evaluating other opportunities to sell excess owned land to supplement our cash position and potential contract manufacturing or other outsourcing arrangements. We estimate additional charges associated with completing the second phase of our Restructuring Plan may approximate 1.0 million. We anticipate the second phase of our Restructuring Plan and the related actions described above may result in annual cost savings of over 2.0 million. The amounts we will ultimately realize or disburse in connection with the Restructuring Plan could differ materially from our estimates, and we may incur additional non-cash charges in future periods depending on our ability to execute asset sales or pursue other alternatives. We may not be able to realize the full extent of our anticipated cost savings if industry conditions persist and net sales volumes worsen. 
 We maintain an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory that is based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. While we believe our estimates of charges relating to our Restructuring Plan, long-lived assets, inventory obsolescence, and accounts receivable allowances are reasonable, it is possible that we may incur additional charges in the future and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions. Depending on the length and severity of the industry and market conditions impacting our business, it is possible we may execute additional restructuring plan actions and incur future associated charges, and we may not be able to realize the full extent of our anticipated cost savings.

 Results of Operations Comparison of three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following table sets forth our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, including amounts and percentages of net sales for each period and the period-to-period change in dollars and percent (amounts in thousands): 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Period change Net sales 44,009 100.0 54,168 100.0 (10,159) -18.8 Cost of goods sold 35,490 80.6 50,859 93.9 (15,369) -30.2 Gross profit 8,519 19.4 3,309 6.1 5,210 157.4 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 17,556 39.9 19,543 36.1 (1,987) -10.2 Loss on asset disposition 0.0 0.0 N/A Loss from operations (9,037) -20.5 (16,234) -30.0 7,197 44.3 Interest expense (3,910) -8.9 (3,963) -7.3 (53) -1.3 Other income, net 80 0.2 402 0.7 (322) -80.1 Loss before tax (12,867) -29.2 (19,795) -36.5 6,928 35.0 Income tax expense (279) -0.6 (89) -0.2 190 213.5 Net loss (13,146) -29.9 (19,884) -36.7 6,738 33.9 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Period change Net sales 152,974 100.0 179,397 100.0 (26,423) -14.7 Cost of goods sold 122,679 80.2 150,234 83.7 (27,555) -18.3 Gross profit 30,295 19.8 29,163 16.3 1,132 3.9 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 55,836 36.5 67,442 37.6 (11,606) -17.2 Loss on asset disposition 11,520 7.5 0.0 11,520 N/A Loss from operations (37,061) -24.2 (38,279) -21.3 1,218 3.2 Interest expense (11,652) -7.6 (11,423) -6.4 229 2.0 Other income, net 374 0.2 22 0.0 352 1,600.0 Loss before tax (48,339) -31.6 (49,680) -27.7 1,341 2.7 Income tax (expense) benefit (865) -0.6 82 0.0 947 1,154.9 Net loss (49,204) -32.2 (49,598) -27.6 394 0.8 
 Net sales 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 44.0 million, a decrease of 10.2 million, or 18.8 compared to the same period in 2023. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 153.0 million, a decrease of 26.4 million, or 14.7 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The 18.8 decrease in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 13.7 decline in volume/mix of products sold and a 4.9 decrease in price. The decrease in volume/mix of products sold was primarily related to the aforementioned oversupply in the cannabis industry. The 14.7 decrease in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a 11.3 decline in volume/mix of products sold and a 3.3 decrease in price. The decrease in volume/mix of products sold was primarily related to the aforementioned oversupply in the cannabis industry. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 8.5 million, an increase of 5.2 million, or 157.4 , compared to the same period in 2023. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 30.3 million, an increase of 1.1 million, or 3.9 , compared to the same period in 2023. Our gross profit margin percentage increased to 19.4 
 28 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.1 in the same period in 2023. Our gross profit margin percentage increased to 19.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 16.3 in the same period in 2023. 
 Gross profit and gross profit margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily due to 6.9 million and 7.8 million of decreases in restructuring charges, respectively, from the prior year period. Additionally, gross profit increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to selling a higher proportion of proprietary brand products, as well as improved productivity. These increases more than offset the impact of lower net sales. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 17.6 million, a decrease of 2.0 million, or 10.2 compared to the same period in 2023. SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 55.8 million, a decrease of 11.6 million, or 17.2 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 SG A expenses decreased 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to lower expenses in several areas, including as a result of our cost saving and restructuring initiatives: (i) a 0.9 million decrease in facility costs, (ii) a 0.6 million decrease in employee compensation costs, including stock-based compensation and salaries and benefits, and (iii) a 0.4 million decrease in insurance, along with other expense reductions in multiple areas including professional fees and outside services. 
 The 11.6 million decrease in SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to lower expenses in several areas, including as a result of our cost saving and restructuring initiatives: (i) a 3.6 million decrease in facility costs, (ii) a 2.5 million decrease in salaries and benefits, (iii) a 1.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation, (iv) a 1.5 million decrease in professional fees and outside services, and (v) a 1.5 million decrease in insurance costs, along with other expense reductions in multiple areas. 
 Loss on asset disposition 
 As previously described, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with CM Fabrication, LLC to sell assets relating to the production of durable equipment products for 8.7 million. The Asset Sale closed during the second quarter of 2024, and we sold or disposed of inventories and other assets. We recorded a Loss on asset disposition of 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 3 Restructuring and asset dispositions for a further description of the Asset Sale. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 3.9 million, which is a slight decrease from 4.0 million of interest expense recorded in the same period in the prior year. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 11.7 million, an increase of 0.2 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower debt outstanding due to principal repayments, partially offset by higher variable interest rates on our Term Loan. The increase during nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to higher variable interest rates on our Term Loan, partially offset by lower debt outstanding due to principal repayments. 
 Other income, net 
 Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.1 million, a decrease of 0.3 million compared to 0.4 million during the same period in the prior year. Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.4 million, an increase of 0.4 million compared to less than 0.1 million during the same period in the prior year. Other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by interest income and foreign currency exchange gains. 
 Income taxes 
 We recorded income tax expense of 0.3 million and 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of (2.2) and (1.8) , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in full valuation allowance. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions and U.S. state taxes. 
 We recorded income tax expense of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an effective tax rate of (0.4) . We recorded an income tax benefit of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an effective income tax rate of 0.2 . Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, differs 
 29 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to maintaining a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the United States and most foreign jurisdictions. The income tax expense and benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily due to minor foreign tax items in certain jurisdictions. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flow from Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (amounts in thousands): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) from operating activities (2,980) 8,629 Net cash from (used in) investing activities 1,461 (4,058) Net cash (used in) from financing activities (4,287) 6,644 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (102) (49) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (5,908) 11,166 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 30,312 21,291 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 24,404 32,457 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net cash usage was primarily due to a 0.8 million net cash inflow from a reduction in working capital, offset by a net loss of 49.2 million, less net non-cash items of 45.4 million. The 0.8 million net reduction in working capital was primarily comprised of a 8.9 million decrease of inventories, a 0.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, and a 0.8 million decrease of prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a 7.1 million decrease of lease liabilities and a 2.3 million decrease in accounts payable. As described in Note 3 Restructuring and asset dispositions, in connection with the Asset Sale, we estimated the amount of cash proceeds associated with the sale of inventories as 5.0 million and classified the amount within net cash from operating activities. In addition, the Company paid cash of 1.3 million to terminate the facility operating lease in connection with the Asset Sale. 
 Net cash from operating activities was 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by positive cash from operating activities in the second and third quarters. The net cash from operating activities was primarily due to a 11.7 million net cash inflow from a reduction in working capital, partially offset by a reported net loss of 49.6 million less non-cash items of 46.6 million. The net reduction in working capital was primarily driven by decreases of inventories of 22.6 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1.2 million, partially offset by decreases of 7.0 million of lease liabilities and 4.4 million of accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash from investing activities was 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and net cash used in investing activities was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We received cash proceeds from the Asset Sale associated with the sale of property, plant and equipment of 3.7 million during the second quarter of 2024, along with other cash from investing activities of 0.4 million. These cash proceeds were partially offset by 2.6 million of capital expenditures of property, plant and equipment. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to capital expenditures of property, plant and equipment. The capital expenditures of property, plant and equipment in 2024 and 2023 primarily relate to investments in our peat moss harvesting operation in Canada. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by (i) 2.9 million of Term Loan repayments relating to required quarterly payments of principal and prepayments made in 
 30 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 conjunction with the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, and (ii) finance lease principal payments of 1.3 million which included approximately 0.7 million relating to equipment finance lease payments made in connection with the Asset Sale. 
 Net cash from financing activities was 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by 8.6 million of proceeds from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction. In addition, we paid 0.9 million on the Term Loan relating to required quarterly payments of principal. 
 Availability and Use of Cash 
 Our ability to make investments in our business, service our debt and maintain liquidity will depend upon our ability to generate excess operating cash flows through our operating subsidiaries. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities, combined with current cash levels and borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to support our ongoing operations, to fund debt service requirements, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital needs through the next twelve months of operations. However, we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available under our borrowing agreements in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other working capital needs. Actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control as further discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 As further described in Note 3 Restructuring and asset dispositions, we closed on an Asset Sale and received gross proceeds of 8.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024. In accordance with the Company s Term Loan, the net proceeds, approximately 6.3 million, from the Asset Sale transaction are required to be reinvested into certain permitted investments, such as capital expenditures, or offered to prepay Term Loan principal. The Company intends to reinvest the net proceeds from the Asset Sale into certain permitted investments, such as capital expenditures, in accordance with provisions of the Term Loan. 
 If necessary, we believe that we could supplement our cash position through additional sale-leasebacks, asset sales and equity financing. During the second quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of the excess owned land at our Goshen, New York location, and are evaluating other opportunities to sell excess owned land to supplement our cash position. We believe it is prudent to be prepared if required and, accordingly, continue to be engaged in the process of evaluating and preparing to implement one or more of the aforementioned activities. Any potential such event may be subject to provisions refer enced in our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, such as subjecting the Company to make mandatory prepayments . 
 Term Loan 
 On October 25, 2021, we and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into the Term Loan with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, pursuant to which we borrowed a 125 million senior secured term loan (the "Term Loan"). The Term Loan was amended by Amendment No. 1 effective as of June 27, 2023, to replace the LIBOR referenced rates with SOFR referenced rates. Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, any Term Loan that constitutes a Eurodollar Rate Loan that is outstanding as of the Amendment No. 1 closing date shall continue until the end of the applicable interest period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan and the provisions of the Term Loan applicable thereto shall continue and remain in effect (notwithstanding the occurrence of the Amendment No. 1 closing date) until the end of the applicable interest period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, after which such provisions shall have had no further force or effect. Such Eurodollar Rate Loan shall subsequently either be an ABR Loan or a Term Benchmark Loan. The ABR Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate (with a 2.0 floor) plus 4.50 , and Term Benchmark Loans shall bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (with a 1.0 floor) plus 5.50 . As of the date of filling this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the ABR Loan and Term Benchmark Loan credit spreads of 4.50 and 5.50 , respectively, within the Amendment No. 1 have not changed from the credit spreads in the original Term Loan. The Term Loan matures on October 25, 2028. 
 The principal amounts of the Term Loan are scheduled to be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments in amounts equal to 0.25 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan on the last day of each fiscal quarter commencing March 31, 2022, with the balance of the Term Loan payable on the Maturity Date of October 25, 2028. 
 We are also required to make mandatory prepayments in the event of (i) achieving certain excess cash flow criteria, including the achievement and maintenance of a specific leverage ratio, (ii) certain asset sales that are collateral, or (iii) upon the issuance, offering, or placement of new debt obligations. As described in Note 7 Leases , we received net cash proceeds in January 2023 from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction and are subject to a provision whereby such net cash proceeds can be reinvested into certain investments, such as capital expenditures. This provision of the Term Loan includes (i) cash investments made within a one-year period from the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, and (ii) investments which are contractually committed 
 31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 within one-year of the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, and paid within 180 days after entering into such contractual commitment. The amount of any net cash proceeds which are not reinvested would require us to make an offer to prepay the corresponding amount on the Term Loan in 2024. In accordance with this provision, we classified 1.7 million as current debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, and prepaid the Term Loan in this amount during the three months ended March 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have satisfied this provision through a combination of payments made pursuant to the contractual commitments and an additional 0.3 million repayment of the Term Loan . The foregoing description of the reinvestment provision does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Term Loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan was 119.6 million and 122.5 million, respectively. 
 The Term Loan requires us to maintain certain reporting requirements, affirmative covenants, and negative covenants. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. The Term Loan is secured by a first lien on our non-working capital assets and a second lien on our working capital assets. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On March 29, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, issuing bank and swingline lender for a revolving line of credit up to 50 million. The Revolving Credit Facility was amended by the First Amendment dated August 31, 2021, which increased the revolving line of credit by an additional 50 million for an aggregate borrowing limit of 100 million. The Revolving Credit Facility was further amended by the Second Amendment dated October 25, 2021 which, among other things, permitted the incurrence of the Term Loan and made certain other changes including subordinating its liens on non-working capital assets to the obligations under the Term Loan. The Revolving Credit Facility was further amended by the Third Amendment and Joinder dated August 23, 2022, pursuant to which several previously acquired subsidiaries became parties to the Revolving Credit Facility and granted liens on their assets. On December 22, 2022, we entered into the Fourth Amendment pursuant to which a sale-leaseback transaction was permitted, and certain other changes were made, including a reduction of the maximum commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility from 100 million to 75 million and transitioning the LIBOR based rates to SOFR based rates. On March 31, 2023, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Fifth Amendment, pursuant to which the maturity date was extended to June 30, 2026, the maximum commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility was reduced to 55 million, and the interest rate on borrowings was revised to various spreads, based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. On November 1, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to which the maximum commitment amount was reduced to 35 million. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility provides for various interest rate options including the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate, the CB Floating Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR, or the CBFR. The rates that use SOFR as the reference rate (Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate, the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR and the CBFR rate) use the Term SOFR Rate plus 1.95 . Each rate has a 0.0 floor. A fee of 0.40 per annum is charged for available but unused borrowings. Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien (subject to certain permitted liens) in substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' respective personal property assets pursuant to the terms of a U.S. and Canadian Pledge and Security Agreement dated March 29, 2021 and other security documents, as amended to include additional subsidiaries. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility maintains certain reporting requirements, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and financial covenants. A certain financial covenant becomes applicable in the event that our excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than an amount equal to 10 of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment 55 million as of September 30, 2024) and would require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1x on a rolling twelve-month basis. 
 In order to consummate permitted acquisitions or to make restricted payments, we would be required to comply with a higher fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15x, but no such acquisitions or payments are currently contemplated. 
 We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 17 million was available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, before we would be required to comply with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1x. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had zero borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our primary market risk has been interest rate, foreign currency and inflation risk. We do not have material exposure to commodity risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk through our variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 119.6 million of Term Loan debt that is subject to variable interest rates that are based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or an alternate base rate. Refer to Item 1. Financial Statements , Note 10 Debt for details relating to the debt. If the rates were to increase by 100 basis points from the rates in effect as of September 30, 2024, our interest expense on the variable-rate debt would increase by an average of 1.1 million annually. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumptions that interest rate changes would be instantaneous, while SOFR changes regularly. We do not currently hedge our interest rate risks, but may determine to do so in the future. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiary operations are predominantly in the Canadian dollar CAD and the Euro. For the purposes of presenting these condensed consolidated financial statements, the assets, and liabilities of subsidiaries with CAD or Euro functional currencies are translated into USD using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average rate prevailing during the period with exchange differences impacting other comprehensive income (loss) in equity. Therefore, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the CAD. We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates when we sell product in currencies different from the currency in which costs were incurred. The functional currencies and our purchasing and sales activities primarily include USD, CAD and Euro. As these currencies fluctuate against each other, and other currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales, purchasing transactions, and labor. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange contracts and currently do not expect to enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical costs. We cannot provide assurances that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 For a discussion of risk factors, please read Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report. Such risk factors continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and operating results. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been the following material changes with respect to such risk factors: 
 We are not currently in compliance with the continued listing requirements for Nasdaq. If the price of our common stock continues to trade below 1.00 per share for a sustained period or we do not meet other continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could affect the market price and liquidity for our common stock and reduce our ability to raise additional capital. 
 On March 14, 2024, we received written notice (the Notification Letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum closing bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the Notification Letter, the Company did not meet the minimum closing bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time prior to September 10, 2024. 
 On August 9, 2024, the Company submitted a request to Nasdaq for a 180-day extension to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Company indicated to Nasdaq that it met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and provided notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the extended compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. On June 6, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio between 1-for-1.1 and 1-for-25, with the decision of whether to implement such split being subject to the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors. 
 On September 12, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it had approved the Company s application to transfer its listing from Nasdaq s Global Select Market tier to the Capital Market tier. This transfer was effective at the opening of business on Friday, September 13, 2024. Nasdaq also approved an additional 180-day extension to March 10, 2025 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). We continue to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and consider our available options to resolve our noncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or we will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria. If we fail to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or to meet the other applicable continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq. 
 Delisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, the price of our common stock may decline and our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or on the pink sheets where an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of their common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. Further, if we are delisted, we would incur additional costs under requirements of state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market.

 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 On November 1, 2024, Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, issuing bank and swingline lender, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. The Sixth Amendment reduced the maximum commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility from 55 million to 35 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s borrowing base assets supported availability of approximately 17 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the maximum commitment amount reduction to have any material immediate negative impact on its overall liquidity position. Furthermore, as of November 1, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Sixth Amendment did not modify the existing financial covenant relating to the applicability of the Company s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Company is charged a fee of 0.40 per annum for unused borrowings under the maximum commitment amount and anticipates a reduction in these fees in future periods as a result of the commitment reduction pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. 
 The foregoing description of the Sixth Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Sixth Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.5 to this Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.
