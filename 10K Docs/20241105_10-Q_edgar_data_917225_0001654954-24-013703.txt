This disturbance consists of an exploration camp including certain drill sites and access roads at the camp. The estimate was based upon estimated cash costs for reclamation as determined by Solitario and its joint venture partner Teck and is supported by a permitting bond required by the State of Alaska, for which Solitario has purchased a reclamation bond insurance policy in the event Solitario or Teck, do not complete required reclamation. Solitario has not applied a discount rate to the recorded asset retirement obligation as the estimated time frame for reclamation is not currently known, as completion reclamation is not expected to occur until the end of the related project life, which would follow future development and operations, the start of which cannot be estimated or assured at this time. Additionally, no depreciation will be recorded on the related asset for the asset retirement obligation until the Lik Project goes into operation, which cannot be assured. Solitario is also involved in certain matters concerning its current drilling program remediation at its Golden Crest Project. Generally, the remediation at Golden Crest is carried out concurrently with drilling activities, with only ongoing contouring and reseeding of drill sites upon completion of drilling.

Solitario's financial condition and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of what may be expected in future periods. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to dollars are to U.S. dollars. (a) Business Overview and Summary We are an exploration stage company as defined by rules issued by the SEC, with a focus on the acquisition of precious and base metal properties with exploration potential and the development or purchase of royalty interests. Currently our primary focus is the acquisition and exploration of precious metals, zinc and other base metal exploration mineral properties. However, we continue to evaluate other mineral properties for acquisition, and we hold a portfolio of mineral exploration properties and assets for future sale, joint venture or on which to create a royalty prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves. Although our mineral properties may be developed in the future by us, through a joint venture or by a third party, we have never developed a mineral property. In addition to focusing on our current mineral exploration properties, we also from time-to-time evaluate potential strategic transactions for the acquisition of new precious and base metal properties and assets with exploration potential. Our current geographic focus for the evaluation of potential mineral property assets is in North and South America; however, we have conducted property evaluations for potential acquisition in other parts of the world. At September 30, 2024, we consider our Golden Crest Project in South Dakota, our carried interest in the Florida Canyon Project in Peru, and our interest in the Lik Project in Alaska to be our core mineral property assets. In addition, during 2024 we added the Cat Creek Project in Colorado, which has not been explored to the degree of any of our three core assets, described above. We are conducting exploration activities in the United States on our own at the Golden Crest and Cat Creek Projects and through joint ventures operated by our partners in Peru at the Florida Canyon Project and in Alaska at the Lik Project. We also conduct potential acquisition evaluations in other countries located in South and North America. We have recorded revenue in the past from the sale of mineral properties, however revenues and / or proceeds from the sale or joint venture of properties or assets, although generally significant when they have occurred in the past, have not been a consistent source of revenue and would only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis. We have reduced our exposure to the costs of our exploration activities in the past through the use of joint ventures. Although we anticipate that the use of joint ventures to fund some of our exploration activities will continue for the foreseeable future, we can provide no assurance that these or other sources of capital will be available in sufficient amounts to meet our needs, if at all. As of September 30, 2024, we have balances of cash and short-term investments that we anticipate using, in part, to (i) fund costs and activities intended to further the exploration of our Lik, Florida Canyon, Golden Crest and Cat Creek Projects; (ii) conduct reconnaissance exploration and (iii) potentially acquire additional mineral property assets. The fluctuations in precious metal and other commodity prices contribute to a challenging environment for mineral exploration and development, which has created opportunities as well as challenges for the potential acquisition of advanced mineral exploration projects or other related assets at potentially attractive terms. The extent to which our business, including our exploration and other activities and the market for our securities, may be impacted by public health threats, rising geopolitical tension, general economic uncertainty and market volatility will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2023 Annual Report. 15 Table of Contents (b) Results of Operations Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 We had a net loss of 2,276,000 or 0.03 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 1,292,000 or 0.02 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As explained in more detail below, the primary reasons for the increase in our net loss in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023 were (i) an increase in our exploration expense, primarily related to our drilling program at Golden Crest, to 2,067,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to exploration expense of 918,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) an increase in our general and administrative expense of 383,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to general and administrative expense of 282,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023; (iii) the recording of a loss on derivative instruments of 22,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain on derivative instruments of 7,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023; and (iv) the recording of an unrealized gain on short-term investments of 14,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 with no similar item during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Partially offsetting these increases in the net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were (i) an increase in interest and dividend income to 94,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest and dividend income of 35,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023; and (ii) the recording of an unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of 110,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of 141,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Each of the major components of these items is discussed in more detail below. Our net exploration expense increased to 2,067,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to exploration expense of 918,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the initiation of a drilling program at our Golden Crest Project, which increased the exploration expense at Golden Crest to 1,957,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to exploration expense at Golden Crest of 731,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate the drilling to continue during the first part of the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, we incurred 19,000 of exploration expenses at our new Cat Creek Project during the three months ended September 30, 2024, with no similar exploration expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a result of the increase in our focus on the Golden Crest Project during 2024, the remaining projects showed a decrease in exploration expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, with (i) exploration expense of 81,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 at our Lik Project in Alaska compared to exploration expense of 139,000 at the Lik Project during the three months ended September 30, 2023; and (ii) a decrease in our reconnaissance exploration expenditures decreased to 10,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 48,000 of reconnaissance exploration during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate completing the drilling program at Golden Crest during the fourth quarter of 2024 and expect a significant increase in exploration expense for the full year of 2024 compared to the full-year exploration expense of 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we had four contract geologists working at our Golden Crest Project, as well as several part-time employees who assisted our contract geologists in monitoring the drilling project as well as collecting, organizing and testing soil and rock samples at Golden Crest. In addition, certain of our Denver-based personnel spent a portion of their time on the Golden Crest Project and reconnaissance exploration activities described above and related matters. We have budgeted approximately 3,900,000 for the full-year exploration expenditure for 2024, which includes approximately 1,700,000 for drilling at the Golden Crest Project. We expect our full-year exploration expenditures for 2024 to exceed our exploration expenditures for 2023. Exploration expense (in thousands) by project consisted of the following: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Project Name 2024 2023 2024 2023 Golden Crest 1,957 731 2,742 1,458 Lik 81 139 105 172 Cat Creek 19 - 32 - Reconnaissance 10 48 29 118 Total exploration expense 2,067 918 2,908 1,748 16 Table of Contents General and administrative costs, excluding stock option compensation costs, discussed below, were 258,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 224,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The major components of our general and administrative costs were (i) salaries and benefit expense of 79,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to salary and benefit costs of 108,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of a reduction in administrative staff costs; (ii) legal and accounting expenditures of 50,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2023; (iii) office rent and expenses of 34,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 35,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023; and (iv) travel and shareholder relation costs of 95,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 34,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate the full-year general and administrative costs will be comparable for 2024 and 2023. We recorded 125,000 of stock option compensation expense for the amortization of unvested grant date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in-capital during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 58,000 of stock option compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. These non-cash charges related to the expense for vesting on stock options outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The primary reason for the increase in stock option compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was as a result of the grant of an aggregate of 2,125,000 options in the second quarter of 2024, which included amortization of three months, out of the thirty-six-month amortization period of the total grant date fair value of 1,120,000. The remaining expense related to the amortization of grant date fair values of outstanding unvested options for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was comparable. See Note 10, Employee Stock Compensation Plans, above, for additional information on our stock option expense. We recorded a non-cash unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of 110,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of 141,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The non-cash unrealized gain during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to (i) an increase in the fair value of our 100,000 shares of Kinross common stock to 936,000 at September 30, 2024 from a fair value of 832,000 at June 30, 2024 or an increase of 104,000, based on quoted market prices; and (ii) an increase in the fair value of our 134,055 shares of Vox Royalty Corp. Vox common stock to 405,000 at September 30, 2024 from a fair value of 371,000 at June 30, 2024 or an increase of 34,000 based on quoted market prices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of our 7,750,000 shares of Vendetta Mining Corp. Vendetta common stock to 57,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to a fair value of 85,000 at June 30, 2024 or a decrease of 28,000 based on quoted market prices. The non-cash unrealized loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to (i) a decrease in the fair value of our 7,750,000 shares of Vendetta common stock, which decreased to a fair value of 172,000 at September 30, 2023 from a fair value of 234,000 at June 30, 2023 or a decrease of 62,000 based on quoted market prices; (ii) a decrease in the fair value of our 134,055 shares of Vox common stock to 271,000 at September 30, 2023 compared to a fair value of 324,000 at June 30, 2023 or a decrease of 54,000 based on quoted market prices and (iii) a decrease in the fair value of our holdings of 100,000 shares of Kinross common stock to 456,000 at September 30, 2023 compared to a fair value of 477,000 at June 30, 2023 or a decrease of 21,000 based on quoted market prices. We recorded interest and dividend income of 94,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest income of 35,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our funds held in our money market account during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the funds held in our money market account during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our dividend income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3,000 and 12,000 was comparable to the same periods of 2023. We anticipate interest income will decrease during the remainder of 2024 from the amounts recorded through the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we expect to utilize the funds in the money market account to fund our exploration and general and administrative expenditures. We recorded a non-cash unrealized gain on our short-term investments of 14,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the maturing of our USTS, which are marked-to-market and a reversal of prior reductions in the quoted fair value of our existing USTS that were purchased at lower yield-to-maturities than current market values, as the USTS matured and approached face value. We held no USTS during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and accordingly there were no similar changes in the marked-to-market values during the three months ended September 30, 2024. These changes in interest rates are a result of many factors that are not related to our business and do not affect the yield-to-maturity quoted for our investments in USTS at the time we acquire these short-term investments, to the extent we hold the investments to maturity. 17 Table of Contents During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a non-cash loss on derivative instruments of 22,000 related to certain Kinross calls that expire in November 2024, which we held during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain on derivative instruments of 7,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to our holdings of Kinross calls, which expired unexercised in August 2023. See Note 6, Derivative Instruments, above for a discussion of our Kinross calls. We regularly perform evaluations of our mineral property assets to assess the recoverability of our investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable utilizing guidelines based upon future net cash flows from the asset as well as our estimates of the geological potential of an early-stage mineral property and its related value for future sale, joint venture or development by us or others. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded no property impairments. We recorded no income tax expense or benefit during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 as we provide a valuation allowance for the tax benefit arising out of our net operating losses for all periods presented. As a result of our administrative expenses and exploration activities, we anticipate we will not have currently payable income taxes during 2024. In addition to the valuation allowance discussed above, we provide a valuation allowance for our foreign net operating losses, which are primarily related to our exploration activities in Peru. We anticipate we will continue to provide a valuation allowance for these net operating losses until we are in a net tax liability position with regard to those countries where we operate or until it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize those net operating losses in the future. Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 We had a net loss of 3,768,000 or 0.05 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 2,712,000 or 0.04 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As explained in more detail below, the primary reasons for the increase in our net loss were (i) an increase in exploration expense to 2,908,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to exploration expense of 1,748,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) an increase in general and administrative expense to 1,511,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to general and administrative expense of 1,073,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and (iii) the recording of a loss on derivative instruments of 43,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gain on derivative instruments of 30,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting these increases in the net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were (i) a realized gain of 54,000 on the sale of marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable sales of marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) an unrealized gain of 366,000 on marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of 39,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; (iii) the recording of an unrealized gain on short-term investments of 49,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with no similar item during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; and (iv) an increase in interest and dividend income to 295,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest income of 88,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The significant changes for these items are discussed in more detail below. Our net exploration expense increased to 2,908,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,748,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reasons for the increase were (i) the exploration expenditures at our Golden Crest Project increased to 2,742,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,458,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the drilling program discussed above; and (ii) we initiated exploration activities at our new Cat Creek Project in Colorado with 32,000 in exploration expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no similar expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting these increases in exploration expenditures were (i) a reduction in the expenditures at our Lik Project in Alaska to 105,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to exploration expenditures of 172,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and (ii) a reduction in reconnaissance exploration expenditures to 29,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to reconnaissance exploration expenditures of 118,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate continued exploration expenditures at our Golden Crest Project through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2024 from the on-going drilling program as discussed above. 18 Table of Contents General and administrative costs, excluding stock-based compensation expense discussed below, were 971,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 889,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The major components of the costs were (i) salary and benefit expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 292,000 compared to salary and benefit expense of 371,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of salary reductions during 2024; (ii) legal and accounting expenditures of 180,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 193,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; (iii) office and other costs of 104,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 108,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and (iv) travel and shareholder relation costs of 395,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 217,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Solitario recorded 540,000 and 184,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the amortization of unvested grant date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in capital. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the grant of options for 2,125,000 shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in the increased amortization of grant date fair value including the amortization of 280,000 for 25 of the grant date fair value on the date of grant during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no similar grant during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded an unrealized gain on marketable equity securities of 366,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of 39,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The non-cash unrealized gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to (i) an increase in the fair value of our holdings of 100,000 shares of Kinross common stock at September 30, 2024 to 936,000 compared to a fair value of 605,000 at December 31, 2023, or an increase of 331,000 based on quoted market prices; (ii) an increase in the fair value of our holdings of 134,055 shares of Vox common stock to 405,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to a fair value of 276,000 at December 31, 2023, or an increase of 129,000 based on quoted market prices; and (iii) an increase of 22,000 in the fair value of our holdings of 100,000 shares of Highlander common stock from the fair value at December 31, 2023 to the date of the sale of our holdings. These unrealized increases in the value of our marketable equity securities were partially offset by (i) a decrease in the value of our holdings of Vendetta common stock to 57,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to a fair value of 118,000 at December 31, 2023 or a decrease of 61,000 based on quoted market prices; and (ii) the transfer of 54,000 of unrealized gain to realized gain on the sale of our 100,000 shares of Highlander common shares upon the sale of those shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The non-cash unrealized loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to (i) a decrease in the fair value of our holdings of 7,750,000 shares of Vendetta common stock to 172,000 at September 30, 2023 compared to a fair value of 229,000 at December 31, 2022, based on quoted market prices; and (ii) a decrease in the fair value of our holdings of 134,055 shares of Vox to 271,000 at September 30, 2023 compared to a fair value of 311,000 at December 31, 2022. based on quoted market prices. Partially offsetting these decreases in value during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was (i) an increase in the fair value of our holdings of 100,000 shares of Kinross common stock at September 30, 2023 to 456,000 compared to a fair value of 409,000 at December 31, 2022, based on quoted market prices; and (ii) an increase in the fair value of our holdings of Highlander common stock to 11,000 at September 30, 2023. We recorded interest and dividend income of 295,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest and dividend income of 88,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily related to an increase in our average outstanding balance of money market holdings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as an increase in the average interest rate and income earned on our money market account during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the average interest rate and income earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate our interest income will decrease during the remainder of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2024 as a result of the use of our short-term investments and our cash balances primarily for ordinary overhead, operational costs, and the drilling and exploration activities, discussed above. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion of our cash and cash equivalent balances. 19 Table of Contents We recorded a non-cash unrealized gain on our short-term investments of 49,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to certain of our USTS increasing in value as they approached maturity, which were previously recorded at a mark-to-market amount that was below their face value as a result of then-current interest rates being higher than the yield-to-maturity rates of our USTS at the time the USTS were acquired. We did not hold significant investments of USTS during 2024 and did not have a non-cash unrealized gain or loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 100,000 shares of our holdings of Highlander common stock for proceeds of 54,000 and recorded a gain on sale of marketable equity securities of 54,000. We did not sell any marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 3 Marketable Equity Securities to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the sale of marketable equity securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a non-cash loss on derivative instruments of 43,000 related to certain Kinross calls we sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the increase in the underlying value of our holdings of Kinross common stock, discussed above. These calls have a strike price of 9.00 per share and expire in November 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a non-cash gain on derivative instruments of 30,000 related to certain Kinross calls we sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. (c) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Short-term Investments As of September 30, 2024, we have 6,484,000 in cash and short-term investments. The bulk of this, 6,398,000, is held in a money market account at a brokerage firm. We anticipate we will continue to invest our cash and short-term investments in the money market account for that portion not used for exploration and drilling expenditures, and other operating costs during the remainder of 2024. We intend to utilize a portion of our cash and short-term investments to fund our exploration activities and the potential acquisition of mineral assets over the next several years. Investment in Marketable Equity Securities Our marketable equity securities are carried at fair value, which is based upon market quotes of the underlying securities. At September 30, 2024 we own 7,750,000 shares of Vendetta common stock, 100,000 shares of Kinross common stock, and 134,055 shares of Vox common stock. At September 30, 2024, the Vendetta shares are recorded at their fair value of 57,000, the Kinross shares are recorded at their fair value of 936,000; and the Vox shares are recorded at their fair value of 405,000. We sold all of our holdings of Highlander common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for proceeds of 54,000, as discussed above. We did not sell any of our marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 3 Marketable Equity Securities to the condensed consolidated financial statements. We anticipate we may sell some portion of our holdings of marketable equity securities during the remainder of 2024 depending on cash needs and market conditions. Working Capital We had working capital of 7,222,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to working capital of 9,309,000 as of December 31, 2023. Our working capital at September 30, 2024 consists primarily of our cash and short-term investments, discussed above, our investment in marketable equity securities of 1,398,000, and other current assets of 102,000, less our accounts payable of 638,000 and other current liabilities of 124,000. As of September 30, 2024, our cash balances along with our short-term investments and marketable equity securities are adequate to fund our expected expenditures over the next year. The nature of the mineral exploration business requires significant sources of capital to fund the exploration, development and operation of mining projects. We will need additional capital if we decide to develop or operate any of our current exploration projects or any projects or assets we may acquire. We anticipate we would finance any such development through the use of our cash reserves, short-term investments, joint ventures, issuance of debt or equity, or the sale of our interests in other exploration projects or assets. 20 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Plans 2013 Plan As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were options outstanding to acquire 3,173,500 and 3,778,500 shares of our common stock under the 2013 Plan. The outstanding options have exercise prices between 0.69 per share and 0.20 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, options for 250,000 shares were exercised with exercise prices between 0.20 and 0.28 per share for proceeds of 54,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, options for 195,000 shares were exercised with exercise prices between 0.28 and 0.31 per share for proceeds of 59,000. 2023 Plan As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were options outstanding to acquire 2,175,000 and 50,000 shares of our common stock under the 2023 Plan. The outstanding options at September 30, 2024 have exercise prices between 0.85 per share and 0.51 per share. No options were exercised under the 2023 Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. We do not anticipate the exercise of options to be a significant source of cash flow during the remainder of 2024. At the Market Offering Agreement On February 2, 2021, we entered into the ATM Agreement with Wainwright, under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock through Wainwright as sales manager in an at-the-market offering under a prospectus supplement for aggregate sales proceeds of up to 10.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1,802,060 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement at an average price of 0.70 per share for net proceeds of 1,218,000, after commissions and sale expenses. There were no sales of shares of common stock under the ATM Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We may sell additional shares under the ATM Program during the remainder of 2024 if market conditions warrant such sales. (d) Cash Flows Net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 3,350,000 compared to 2,684,000 of net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of (i) an increase in exploration expense to 2,908,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to exploration expense of 1,748,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) an increase in our general and administration expense, excluding non-cash stock based compensation expense, of 971,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the general and administrative expense, excluding the non-cash stock-based compensation expense, of 889,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and (iii) a smaller net increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of 12,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of 34,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Partially offsetting these increases in the use of cash in operations were (i) interest and dividend income of 295,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest and dividend income of 88,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; and (ii) a decrease in prepaid expense and other current assets of 171,000 during nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared an increase in prepaid expense and other current assets of 199,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Based upon projected expenditures in our 2024 budget, we anticipate continued use of funds from operations through the remainder of 2024, primarily for drilling expenditures and other exploration related to our Golden Crest and Lik Projects. See Results of Operations discussed above for further explanation of some of these variances. 21 Table of Contents During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we provided 2,038,000 of cash from the sale of short-term investments compared to 36,000 of cash from the sales of short-term investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased a certificate of deposit for 100,000 that is restricted for reclamation in the event of any un-reclaimed areas of our planned drilling at Golden Crest. This certificate of deposit is shown separately on our balance sheet as restricted cash at September 30, 2024. There was no similar restricted cash item at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired equipment and other assets used in our exploration activities of 12,000 as well as 12,000 of equipment acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We received cash proceeds of 39,000 from the sale of Kinross calls during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash proceeds of 31,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold marketable equity securities for proceeds of 54,000, with no similar sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We also used 43,000 of our cash to acquire additional mineral claims, at our Golden Crest Project, and 12,000 for initial acquisition costs of our new Cat Creek Project during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with no similar mineral property additions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We may sell a portion of our marketable equity securities during the remainder of 2024; however, we do not anticipate the sale of marketable equity securities will be a significant source of cash during the remainder of 2024. We will continue to liquidate a portion of our short-term investments as needed during the remainder of 2024 to fund our operations and any exploration expenditures related to potential mineral property acquisitions . Any potential mineral property acquisition or strategic corporate investment during the remainder of 2024, discussed above, could involve a significant change in our cash provided or used for investing activities, depending on the structure of any potential transaction. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net cash of 1,218,000 from the issuance of common stock under the ATM Program, discussed above. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we received 54,000 and 59,000, respectively, from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options, discussed above in Note 10, Employee Stock Compensation Plans to the condensed consolidated financial statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received net proceeds of 2,422,000 as a result of a private placement for the purchase and sale of 4,166,667 shares of Solitario common stock discussed above in Note 11, Shareholders Equity. (e) Mineral Resources CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF MINERAL PROPERTIES Mineral Reserves and Resources We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), and applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result we report our mineral resources according to two different standards. U.S. reporting requirements are governed by Item 1300 of Regulation S-K S-K 1300 issued by the SEC. Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects NI 43-101 adopted from the definitions provided by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. Both sets of reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but the standards generally embody slightly different approaches and definitions. In our public filings in the U.S. and Canada and in certain other announcements not filed with the SEC, we disclose measured, indicated and inferred resources, each as defined in S-K 1300. The estimation of measured resources and indicated resources involve greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic feasibility than the estimation of proven and probable reserves, and therefore investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into S-K 1300-compliant reserves. The estimation of inferred resources involves far greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic viability than the estimation of other categories of resources, and therefore it cannot be assumed that all or any part of inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically. (f) Off-balance sheet arrangements As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet obligations. (g) Development Activities, Exploration Activities, Environmental Compliance and Contractual Obligations We are not involved in any development activities, nor do we have any contractual obligations related to any potential development activities as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations for exploration activities, environmental compliance or other obligations from those disclosed in our Management s Discussion and Analysis included in our 2023 Annual Report. 22 Table of Contents (h) Discontinued Projects We did not record any mineral property write-downs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. (i) Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. Solitario s valuation of mineral properties is a critical accounting estimate. We review and evaluate our mineral properties for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Significant negative industry or economic trends, adverse social or political developments, geologic results, geo-technical difficulties, or other disruptions to our business are a few examples of events that we monitor, as they could indicate that the carrying value of the mineral properties may not be recoverable. In such cases, a recoverability test may be necessary to determine if an impairment charge is required. There has been no change to our assumptions, estimates or calculations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. (j) Related Party Transactions As of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have no related party transactions or balances. (k) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1, Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements under Recent Accounting Pronouncements above for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. (l) Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the 1934 Act, with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, business prospects, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, capital expenditures, and exploration and development efforts. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, forecasts, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, may, will, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described herein and the risk factors included under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report to which there have been no material changes. These forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements with respect to, among other things: Our estimates of the value and recovery of our short-term investments; Our estimates of future exploration, development, general and administrative and other costs; Our ability to realize a return on our investment in the Lik, Golden Crest and Cat Creek Projects; Our ability to successfully identify and execute on transactions to acquire new mineral exploration properties and other related assets; Our ability to secure financing in the credit or capital markets in amounts and on terms that will allow us to execute our business strategy, invest in new projects, and maintain adequate liquidity; 23 Table of Contents Our estimates of fair value of our investment in shares of Vendetta, Vox and Kinross; Our expectations regarding development and exploration of our properties including those subject to joint venture and shareholder agreements; The impact of political and regulatory developments; The impact of technological changes, system failures, or breaches of our network security as well as other cyber security risks that could subject us to increased operating costs, litigation and other liabilities: The effects of macro-economic and geo-political conditions, including financial market volatility, inflation, interest rate fluctuations, and labor and supply shortages; Our future financial condition or results of operations and our future revenues and expenses; Our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations; and Risks related to natural disasters or adverse external events such as epidemics or pandemics. Although we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that these statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in the statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Smaller Reporting Companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act, as of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer). Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the 1934 Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 24 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
