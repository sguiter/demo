 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS branch locations throughout Long Island and the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, and Westchester County. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the collective results of the Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, which are collectively herein referred to as we , us , our and the Company. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included herein reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. In preparing the interim financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. Such estimates are subject to change in the future as additional information becomes available or previously existing circumstances are modified. Actual future results could differ significantly from those estimates. The annualized results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the entire fiscal year. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts, and the related discussion and analysis, to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders' equity. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which remain significantly unchanged and have been followed similarly as in prior periods.

Additionally, given the nature of the Company s held-to-maturity portfolio which predominantly consists of agency guaranteed securities, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses on the held-to-maturity portfolio. With respect to certain classes of debt securities, primarily U.S. Treasuries and securities issued by Government Sponsored Entities, the Company considers the history of credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero, even if the U.S. government were to technically default. Accrued interest receivable on securities totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was included in other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Condition and excluded from the amortized cost and estimated fair value totals in the table above. Management evaluates available-for-sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which the fair value

Due to the removal of the TDR designation, the Company applies the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification or other form of restructuring results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows include conditions where there is principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions, and/or a combination of these modifications. The disclosures related to loan restructuring are only for modifications that directly affect cash flows. The following table presents loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, disaggregated by loan category and type of concession granted for the three and nine months September 30, 2024 and 2023: Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate Total For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Significant Payment Significant Delay, Term Payment Term Term Extension Delay Extension Extension of and and and and Total Significant Significant Interest Interest Interest Class of Term Payment Payment Rate Rate Rate Financing (Dollars in thousands) Extension Delay Delay Reduction Reduction Reduction Total Receivable Business loans Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate Total

For the purposes of this disclosure, a payment default is defined as 90 or more days past due. Non-accrual loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty remain on non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated performance under the modified terms. Credit Quality Indicators The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit structure, loan documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying them based on credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Bank s credit position at some future date. Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of then existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

 The effects of fair value and cash flow hedging: Gain or (loss) on fair value hedging relationships Interest contracts: Hedged items ) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Gain or (loss) on cash flow hedging relationships Interest contracts: Loss reclassified from AOCI into income Fair Value Hedges The Company uses fair value hedges to protect against changes in fair value of certain interest rate sensitive assets. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.

 Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company uses these types of derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing or forecasted issuances of short-term borrowings. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s debt. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional million will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense. The Company did t terminate any derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The table below presents the effect of the cash flow hedge accounting on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the periods indicated: ) ) ) Loss reclassified from other comprehensive income into interest expense ) ) ) ) All cash flow hedges are recorded gross on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.

Freestanding Derivatives The Company maintains an interest-rate risk protection program for its loan portfolio in order to offer loan level derivatives with certain borrowers and to generate loan level derivative income. The Company enters into interest rate swap or interest rate floor agreements with borrowers. These interest rate derivatives are designed such that the borrower synthetically attains a fixed-rate loan, while the Company receives floating rate loan payments. The Company offsets the loan level interest rate swap exposure by entering into an offsetting interest rate swap or interest rate floor with an unaffiliated and

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Dime Community Bancshares, Inc., a New York corporation, is a bank holding company formed in 1988. On a parent-only basis, the Holding Company has minimal operations, other than as owner of Dime Community Bank. The Holding Company is dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dime Community Bank, its own earnings, additional capital raised, and borrowings as sources of funds. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank's results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit and loan accounts, merchant credit and debit card processing programs, loan swap fees, investment services, income from its title insurance subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses, expenses from the Bank s title insurance subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects our net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts and the related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income or total stockholders' equity. Selected Financial Highlights and Other Data (Dollars in Thousands Except Per Share Amounts)

 Critical Accounting Estimates Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a summary of significant accounting policies. These accounting policies may require various levels of subjectivity, estimates or judgment by management. Policies with respect to the methodologies it uses to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and fair value of loans acquired in a business combination are critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting estimates involve a significant degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often necessitate assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could result in material variations in the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Management has reviewed the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with its Audit Committee. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans Held for Investment Methods and Assumptions Underlying the Estimate The allowance for credit losses is established and maintained through a provision for credit losses based on expected losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged against the allowance. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the allowance for credit losses for loans that share similar risk characteristics, the Company utilizes a model which compares the amortized cost basis of the loan to the net present value of expected cash flows to be collected. Expected credit losses are determined by aggregating the individual cash flows and calculating a loss percentage by loan segment, or pool, for loans that share similar risk characteristics. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, the Company will evaluate the loan on an individual basis. Within the model, assumptions are made in the determination of probability of default, loss given default, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, prepayment rate, curtailment rate, and recovery lag periods. Management assesses the sensitivity of key assumptions at least annually by stressing the assumptions to understand the impact on the model. Statistical regression is utilized to relate historical macro-economic variables to historical credit loss experience of a peer group of banks that operate in and around Dime s footprint. These models are then utilized to forecast future expected loan losses based on expected future behavior of the same macro-economic variables. Adjustments to the quantitative results are made using qualitative factors. These factors include: (1) lending policies and procedures and the experience, ability, and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; (2) international, national, regional and local economic business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various markets; (3) the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; (4) the volume and severity of past due loans; (5) the quality of our loan review system; (6) the value of underlying collateral for collateralized loans; (7) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations; and (8) the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio. The Company evaluates loans that do not share risk characteristics on an individual basis based on various factors. Factors that may be considered are borrower delinquency trends and non-accrual status, probability of foreclosure or note sale, changes in the borrower s circumstances or cash collections, borrower s industry, or other facts and circumstances of the loan or collateral. The expected credit loss is measured based on net realizable value, that is, the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, based on the original effective interest rate, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. For collateral dependent loans, expected credit loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell.

 Uncertainties Regarding the Estimate Estimating the timing and amounts of future losses is subject to significant management judgment as these projected cash flows rely upon the estimates discussed above and factors that are reflective of current or future expected conditions. These estimates depend on the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, borrower, or portfolio specific conditions. Volatility in certain credit metrics and differences between expected and actual outcomes are to be expected. Customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Impact on Financial Condition and Results of Operations If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover expected losses in the loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic, market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance through charges to earnings which would materially decrease our net income. We may experience significant credit losses if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Board of Directors has approved a liquidity policy that it reviews and updates at least annually. Senior management is responsible for implementing the policy. The Bank s Asset Liability Committee ALCO is responsible for general oversight and strategic implementation of the policy and management of the appropriate departments are designated responsibility for implementing any strategies established by ALCO. On a daily basis, appropriate senior management receives a current cash position report and 30-day forecast to ensure that all short-term obligations are timely satisfied, and that adequate liquidity exists to fund future activities. Reports detailing the Bank s liquidity reserves are presented to appropriate senior management on at least a monthly basis, and the Board of Directors at each of its meetings. In addition, a twelve-month liquidity forecast is presented to ALCO in order to assess potential future liquidity concerns. A forecast of cash flow data for the upcoming 12 months is presented to the Board of Directors no less than annually. Given recent banking industry events, management is also monitoring the level of uninsured deposits on a daily basis. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments and deposit withdrawals, either on demand or on contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise. The Bank s primary sources of funding for its lending and investment activities include deposits, loan, investment security principal and interest payments and advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank may also sell or securitize selected multifamily residential, mixed-use or one-to-four family residential real estate loans to private sector secondary market purchasers and has in the past sold such loans to FNMA and FHLMC. The Company may additionally issue debt or equity under appropriate circumstances. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and prepayments on real estate loans and MBS are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank is a member of American Financial Exchange AFX ), through which it may either borrow or lend funds on an overnight or short-term basis with other member institutions. The availability of funds changes daily.

 The Bank gathers deposits in direct competition with commercial banks, savings banks and brokerage firms, many among the largest in the nation. It must additionally compete for deposit monies against the stock and bond markets, especially during periods of strong performance in those arenas. The Bank s deposit flows are affected primarily by the pricing and marketing of its deposit products compared to its competitors, as well as the market performance of depositor investment alternatives such as the U.S. bond or equity markets. To the extent that the Bank is responsive to general market increases or declines in interest rates, its deposit flows should not be materially impacted. However, favorable performance of the equity or bond markets could adversely impact the Bank s deposit flows. Total deposits (including escrow) increased 886.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase of 382.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Within deposits, core deposits i.e., non-CDs) increased 1.08 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an increase of 55.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in core deposits was primarily due to growth in business deposits. In the event that the Bank should require funds beyond its ability or desire to generate them internally, additional sources of funds are available through a borrowing line at the FHLBNY, borrowing capacity at the AFX, lines of credit with unaffiliated correspondent banks, and various brokered deposit sources. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had remaining borrowing capacity of 1.98 billion through the FHLBNY, subject to customary minimum FHLBNY common stock ownership requirements i.e. , 4.5 of the Bank s outstanding FHLBNY borrowings). The Bank reduced its outstanding FHLBNY advances by 805.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 8.0 million decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 12. FHLBNY Advances for further information. Subordinated debentures totaled 272.3 million at September 31, 2024 compared to 200.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to the Company s issuance of subordinated notes that are described in more detail in Note 13. Subordinated Debentures to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, business loan originations totaled 236.1 million and 209.7 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, real estate loan originations (excluding owner-occupied commercial real estate) totaled 147.2 million and 604.7 million, respectively. The Company and the Bank are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by their primary federal regulators. As a general matter, these capital requirements are based on the amount and composition of an institution s assets. At September 30, 2024, both the Company and the Bank were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements and the Bank was considered "well capitalized" for all regulatory purposes. The following table summarizes Company and Bank capital ratios calculated under the Basel III Capital Rules framework as of the period indicated:

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Holding Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. The Holding Company repurchased 36,813 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 947 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 1,566,947 shares remained available for purchase under the authorized share repurchase programs. See "Part II - Item 2. Other Information - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for additional information about repurchases of common stock.

 The Holding Company paid 5.5 million in cash dividends on its preferred stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Holding Company paid 28.5 million and 28.0 million in cash dividends on its common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Contractual Obligations The Bank generally has borrowings outstanding in the form of FHLBNY advances, short-term or overnight borrowings, subordinated debt, as well as customer CDs with fixed contractual interest rates. In addition, the Bank is obligated to make rental payments under leases on certain of its branches and equipment. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its loan origination business, the Bank generally has outstanding commitments to extend credit to borrowers, which are originated pursuant to its regular underwriting standards. Available lines of credit may not be drawn on or may expire prior to funding, in whole or in part, and amounts are not estimates of future cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had 63.8 million of firm loan commitments that were accepted by the borrowers. All of these commitments are expected to close during the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2024. Additionally, in connection with a loan securitization completed in December 2017, the Bank executed a reimbursement agreement with FHLMC that obligates the Company to reimburse FHLMC for any contractual principal and interest payments on defaulted loans, not to exceed 10 of the original principal amount of the loans comprising the aggregate balance of the loan pool at securitization. The maximum exposure under this reimbursement obligation is 28.0 million. The Bank has pledged 27.9 million of pass-through MBS issued by GSEs as collateral. Asset Quality General We do not originate or purchase loans, either whole loans or loans underlying MBS, which would have been considered subprime loans at origination, i.e ., real estate loans advanced to borrowers who did not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their income or credit history. See Note 6 to our unaudited condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of evaluation for impaired securities. Monitoring and Collection of Delinquent Loans Our management reviews delinquent loans on a monthly basis and reports to our Board of Directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting regarding the status of all non-performing and otherwise delinquent loans in our loan portfolio. Our loan servicing policies and procedures require that an automated late notice be sent to a delinquent borrower as soon as possible after a payment is ten days late in the case of multifamily residential, commercial real estate loans, and commercial and industrial C I loans, or fifteen days late in connection with one-to-four family or consumer loans. Thereafter, periodic letters are mailed and phone calls placed to the borrower until payment is received. When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure, we will attempt to obtain the full payment due or negotiate a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure. Accrual of interest is generally discontinued on a loan that meets any of the following three criteria: (i) full payment of principal or interest is not expected; (ii) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more (unless the loan is both deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection); or (iii) an election has otherwise been made to maintain the loan on a cash basis due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. Such non-accrual determination practices are applied consistently to all loans regardless of their internal classification or designation. Upon entering non-accrual status, we reverse all outstanding accrued interest receivable.

 We generally initiate foreclosure proceedings on real estate loans when a loan enters non-accrual status based upon non-payment, unless the borrower is paying in accordance with an agreed upon modified payment agreement. We obtain an updated appraisal to calculate a potential collateral shortfall and to reserve appropriately for the potential loss. Upon completion of a foreclosure action, the property securing the loan is transferred to Other Real Estate Owned OREO status. We generally attempt to utilize all available remedies, such as note sales in lieu of foreclosure, in an effort to resolve non-accrual loans and OREO properties as quickly and prudently as possible in consideration of market conditions, the physical condition of the property and any other mitigating circumstances. We have not initiated any expected or imminent foreclosure proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event that a non-accrual loan is subsequently brought current, it is returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectability has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions for a period of generally at least six months. The C I portfolio is actively managed by our lenders and underwriters. Most credit facilities typically require an annual review of the exposure and borrowers are required to submit annual financial reporting and loans are structured with financial covenants to indicate expected performance levels. Smaller C I loans are monitored based on performance and the ability to draw against a credit line is curtailed if there are any indications of credit deterioration. Guarantors are also required to update their financial reporting. All exposures are risk rated and those entering adverse ratings due to financial performance concerns of the borrower or material delinquency of any payments or financial reporting are subjected to added management scrutiny. Measures taken typically include amendments to the amount of the available credit facility, requirements for increased collateral, additional guarantor support or a material enhancement to the frequency and quality of financial reporting. Loans determined to reach adverse risk rating standards are monitored closely by Credit Administration to identify any potential credit losses. When warranted, loans reaching a Substandard rating could be reassigned to the Workout Group for direct handling. Non-accrual Loans Within our held-for-investment loan portfolio, non-accrual loans totaled 49.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 29.1 million at December 31, 2023. The following is a reconciliation of non-accrual loans as of the dates indicated: 

September 30, December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Non-accrual loans: Business loans 25,411 18,574 19,555 One-to-four family residential, including condominium and cooperative apartment 3,880 3,248 2,874 Multifamily residential and residential mixed-use Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate 19,509 6,620 15 ADC 657 657 657 Other loans 6 219 Total non-accrual loans 49,463 29,099 23,320 Ratios: Total non-accrual loans to total loans 0.45 0.27 0.21 Total non-performing assets to total assets 0.36 0.21 0.17 Loan Restructurings The accrual status of each restructured loan is determined separately in accordance with our policies for determining accrual or non-accrual status. At the time the modification agreement is entered into between the Bank and the borrower the loan can be on either accrual or non-accrual status. If a loan is on non-accrual status at the time it is restructured, it continues to be classified as non-accrual until the borrower has demonstrated compliance with the modified loan terms for a period of at least six months. Conversely, if at the time of restructuring the loan is performing (and accruing) it will remain accruing throughout its restructured period, unless the loan subsequently meets any of the criteria for non-accrual status under our policy and agency regulations.

 Within the allowance for credit losses, losses are estimated for restructured loans on accrual status as well as restructured loans on non-accrual status that are one-to-four family loans or consumer loans, on a pooled basis with loans that share similar risk characteristics. Restructured loans on non-accrual status excluding one-to-four family and consumer loans are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses. For restructured loans that are collateral-dependent where the Bank has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we expect repayment of the loan to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of collateral, less the estimated costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For non-collateral-dependent loans, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. OREO Property acquired by the Bank, or a subsidiary, as a result of foreclosure on a mortgage loan or a deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO. Upon entering OREO status, we obtain a current appraisal on the property and reassess the likely realizable value a/k/a fair value) of the property quarterly thereafter. OREO is carried at the lower of the fair value or book balance, with any write downs recognized through a provision recorded in non-interest expense. Only the appraised value, or either a contractual or formal marketed value that falls below the appraised value, is used when determining the likely realizable value of OREO at each reporting period. We typically seek to dispose of OREO properties in a timely manner. As a result, OREO properties have generally not warranted subsequent independent appraisals. There was no carrying value of OREO properties on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. We did not recognize any provisions for losses on OREO properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Past Due Loans Loans Delinquent 30 to 59 Days At September 30, 2024, there were 8.2 million of loans between 30 and 59 days past due. At December 31, 2023, there were 12.0 million of loans between 30 and 59 days past due. The 30 to 59-day delinquency levels fluctuate monthly and are generally considered a less accurate indicator of near-term credit quality trends than non-accrual loans. Loans Delinquent 60 to 89 Days At September 30, 2024, there were 30.0 million of loans between 60 and 89 days past due. At December 31, 2023, there were 1.3 million of loans 60 and 89 days past due. The 60 to 89-day delinquency levels fluctuate monthly and are generally considered a less accurate indicator of near-term credit quality trends than non-accrual loans. Accruing Loans 90 Days or More Past Due There were no accruing loans 90 days or more past due at September 30, 2024 or at December 31, 2023. Allowance for Off-Balance Sheet Exposures The Bank maintains an allowance, recorded in other liabilities, associated with unfunded loan commitments accepted by the borrower. The amount of our allowance was 3.1 million and 2.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Any increases or reductions in this allowance are recognized in provision for credit losses.

 Allowance for Credit Losses Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.4 million, compared to a credit loss recovery of 950 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 22.4 million credit loss provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was related to a combination of factors including, provisioning for growth and individually analyzed loans in the business loan portfolio as well as provisioning for the pooled multifamily loan portfolio. The 950 thousand credit loss recovery for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily associated with a reduction in reserves on pooled Purchased Credit Deteriorated PCD loans that were acquired as part of the Company s 2021 Merger. For a further discussion of the allowance for credit losses and related activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, please see Note 7 to the condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table presents our allowance for credit losses allocated by loan type and the percent of loans in each category to total loans as of the dates indicated.

 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Assets . Assets totaled 13.75 billion at September 30, 2024, 110.5 million above their level at December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases of 168.5 million in cash and due from banks, 105.1 million in the loan portfolio and 22.6 million in BOLI, partially offset by decreases of 113.8 million in total investment securities, 34.5 million in restricted stock, 16.5 million in derivative assets and 9.8 million in premises and fixed assets. Total loans, net of allowance increased 105.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 10.81 billion at period end. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had loan originations of 383.4 million. Total investment securities decreased 113.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 1.37 billion at period end, primarily due to proceeds from principal payments, calls and maturities of 167.1 million, offset by purchases of 21.0 million and a decrease in unrealized losses of 32.3 million. There were no transfers to or from securities held-to-maturity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Premises and fixed assets decreased 9.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 35.1 million at period end, primarily due to the sale of two Bank owned buildings. Total restricted stock decreased 34.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 64.2 million at period end, primarily due to a reduction in FHLBNY advances. Liabilities . Total liabilities increased 72.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 12.48 billion at period end, primarily due to an increase of 886.7 million in deposits (including mortgage escrow accounts) and an increase of 72.1 million in subordinated debt, partially offset by decreases of 805.0 million in FHLBNY advances, 39.1 million in derivative cash collateral and 23.2 million in derivative liabilities. Subordinated debt increased 72.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 272.3 million at period end, due to the Company raising 74.8 million of gross proceeds from a registered public offering of its 9.000 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2034 (the Notes ). Stockholders Equity . Stockholders equity increased 37.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to 1.26 billion at period end, primarily due to net income of 49.5 million and other comprehensive income of 18.6 million, partially offset by common stock dividends of 29.3 million, and preferred stock dividends of 5.5 million. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General. Net income was 13.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased by 3.4 million, the credit loss provision increased by 9.8 million, non-interest income decreased by 297 thousand, non-interest expense decreased by 1.8 million, and income tax expense decreased by 3.2 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The discussion of net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with the following tables, which set forth certain information related to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those periods, and which also present the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. The average yields and costs were derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of their related assets or liabilities during the periods represented. Average balances were derived from average daily balances. No tax-equivalent adjustments have been made for interest income exempt from federal, state, and local taxation. The yields include loan fees consisting of amortization of loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct and indirect origination costs, prepayment fees, and late charges that are considered adjustments to yields. Net loan fees included in interest income were 849 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net loan fees included in interest income were 320 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loan fees was primarily due to increases in prepayment penalty fees and deferred fees on loans in 2024.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 6.4 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting increases in interest income of 8.3 million on business loans, 1.9 million on one-to-four family loans and 620 thousand on non-owner-occupied loans. The increased interest income on business loans was due to a 349.7 million increase in the average balances and a 37-basis point increase in the yield of such loans in the period. The increased interest income on one-to-four family loans was related to a 62-basis point increase in the yield and a 44.5 million increase in the average balances of such loans in the period. The increased interest income on non-owner-occupied loan income was related to a 22-basis point increase in the yield, partially offset by a decrease of 85.2 million in the average balances of such loans in the period.

The discussion of net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with the following tables, which set forth certain information related to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those periods, and which also present the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. The average yields and costs were derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of their related assets or liabilities during the periods represented. Average balances were derived from average daily balances. No tax-equivalent adjustments have been made for interest income exempt from federal, state, and local taxation. The yields include loan fees consisting of amortization of loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct and indirect origination costs, prepayment fees, and late charges that are considered adjustments to yields. Net loan fees

 included in interest income were 545 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net loan fees included in interest income were 975 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loan fees was primarily due to the decline in loan deferred fees and costs, and the decline in loan prepayment fees in 2024. Analysis of Net Interest Income

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk were presented at December 31, 2023 in Item 7A of the Holding Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. The following is an update of the discussion provided therein. General . The Company s largest component of market risk remains interest rate risk. The Company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we conducted zero transactions involving derivative instruments requiring bifurcation in order to hedge interest rate or market risk. Interest Rate Risk Exposure Analysis Economic Value of Equity EVE Analysis . In accordance with agency regulatory guidelines, the Company simulates the impact of interest rate volatility upon EVE using several interest rate scenarios. EVE is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the Company s assets and liabilities and the value of any off-balance sheet items, such as derivatives, if applicable.

 Traditionally, the fair value of fixed-rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Increases in interest rates thus result in decreases in the fair value of interest-earning assets, which could adversely affect the Company s consolidated results of operations in the event they were to be sold, or, in the case of interest-earning assets classified as available-for-sale, reduce the Company s consolidated stockholders equity, if retained. The changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates measure the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities. In order to measure the Company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates, EVE is calculated under market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter-end Pre-Shock Scenario ), and under various other interest rate scenarios Rate Shock Scenarios representing immediate, permanent, parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates from the actual term structure observed in the Pre-Shock Scenario. An increase in the EVE is considered favorable, while a decline is considered unfavorable. The changes in EVE between the Pre-Shock Scenario and various Rate Shock Scenarios due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the Company s assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items that are included in the EVE. Management reports the EVE results to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The report compares the Company s estimated Pre-Shock Scenario EVE to the estimated EVE calculated under the various Rate Shock Scenarios. The Company s valuation model makes various estimates regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and deposit decay rates at each level of interest rate change. The Company s estimates for loan repayment levels are influenced by the recent history of prepayment activity in its loan portfolio, as well as the interest rate composition of the existing portfolio, especially in relation to the existing interest rate environment. In addition, the Company considers the amount of fee protection inherent in the loan portfolio when estimating future repayment cash flows. Regarding deposit decay rates, the Company tracks and analyzes the decay rate of its deposits over time, with the assistance of a reputable third-party, and over various interest rate scenarios. Such results are utilized in determining estimates of deposit decay rates in the valuation model. The Company also generates a series of spot discount rates that are integral to the valuation of the projected monthly cash flows of its assets and liabilities. The valuation model employs discount rates that it considers representative of prevailing market rates of interest with appropriate adjustments it believes are suited to the heterogeneous characteristics of the Company s various asset and liability portfolios. No matter the care and precision with which the estimates are derived, actual cash flows could differ significantly from the Company s estimates resulting in significantly different EVE calculations. The analysis that follows presents, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated EVE at both the Pre-Shock Scenario and the -200 Basis Point, -100 Basis Point, +100 Basis Point, and +200 Basis Point Rate Shock Scenarios. 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Dollar Percentage Dollar Percentage (Dollars in thousands) EVE Change Change EVE Change Change Rate Shock Scenarios + 200 Basis Points 1,699,789 162,618 10.6 1,414,548 79,745 6.0 + 100 Basis Points 1,662,650 125,479 8.2 1,375,777 40,974 3.1 Pre-Shock Scenario 1,537,171 1,334,803 - 100 Basis Points 1,418,589 (118,582) (7.7) 1,247,956 (86,847) (6.5) - 200 Basis Points 1,202,625 (334,546) (21.8) 1,112,110 (222,693) (16.7) The Company s Pre-Shock Scenario EVE increased from 1.33 billion at December 31, 2023 to 1.54 billion at September 30, 2024. The primary factor contributing to the increase in EVE is an increase in the value of the Bank s non-maturity deposit base. The Company s EVE in the +100 Basis Point Rate and +200 Basis Point Rate Shock Scenarios increased from 1.38 billion and 1.41 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, to 1.66 billion and 1.70 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024. In the -100 Basis Point Rate and -200 Basis Point Rate Shock Scenario the Company s EVE increased from 1.25 billion and 1.11 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023, to 1.42 billion and 1.20 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024.

 Income Simulation Analysis . As of the end of each quarterly period, the Company also monitors the impact of interest rate changes through a net interest income simulation model. This model estimates the impact of interest rate changes on the Company s net interest income over forward-looking periods typically not exceeding 36 months (a considerably shorter period than measured through the EVE analysis). Management reports the net interest income simulation results to the Company s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The following table discloses the estimated changes to the Company s net interest income in various time periods assuming gradual changes in interest rates over a 12-month period beginning September 30, 2024, for the given rate scenarios: 

Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Gradual Change in Interest rates of: Year-One Year-Two + 200 Basis Points (1.7) + 100 Basis Points (0.7) 0.4 - 100 Basis Points 2.3 1.9 - 200 Basis Points 3.8 1.3 Management also examines the potential impact to net interest income by simulating the impact of instantaneous changes to interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated changes to the Company s net interest income in various time periods associated with the given interest rate shock scenarios. 

Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Instantaneous Rate Shock Scenarios Year-One Year-Two + 200 Basis Points (0.8) 2.5 + 100 Basis Points (0.2) 1.7 - 100 Basis Points 2.2 0.3 - 200 Basis Points 2.8 (2.4) iIte Item 4. Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, with the participation of its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
