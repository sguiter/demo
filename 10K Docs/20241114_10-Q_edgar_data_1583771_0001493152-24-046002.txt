by future or conditional verbs such as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, 
believe, estimate and continue or similar words. You should read statements that contain these words
carefully because they discuss future expectations and plans, which contain projections of future results of operations or financial
condition or state other forward-looking information. Such statements are only predictions and our actual results may differ materially
from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. We believe that it is important to communicate future expectations to investors.
However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Factors that may cause such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in the audited consolidated financial statements

on April 16, 2024, as well as under Item 1A . Risk Factors within this Form 10-Q. These factors include the uncertainties associated
with: 

our
 ability to successfully consummate the proposed merger Pharma Two B Ltd., or any strategic transaction
 that we may consummate in the future; 

our
 anticipated net cash balance and expectations regarding relative ownership percentages in the combined company following consummation
 of the Merger; 

our
 ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger and our ability to manage the risks of the proposed Merger; 

the
 effects that the pendency of the Merger may have on our business prior to the closing of the Merger, or if the Merger does not close; 

our
 ability to raise substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and fund our planned operations in the near term; 

estimates
 regarding our expenses, use of cash, timing of future cash needs and anticipated capital requirements; 

success
 in retaining, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors; 

our
 public securities potential liquidity and trading; 

our
 ability to license additional intellectual property to support our strategic alternatives or out-license our intellectual property;

our
 expectation of developments and projections relating to competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or our
 industry; 

our
 ability to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market; and 

our
 intellectual property position, including the strength and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. 

We
do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements as circumstances change and thus you should not unduly rely on these
statements.

a range of strategic and financing alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value within the current financial environment and
NASH drug development landscape. On April 19, 2024, we announced that we have begun wind-down activities in our ASCEND-NASH clinical
trial which wind-down activities have since been completed and the trial has been closed.

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries, Contravir Research
Inc. and Hepion Research Corp, which conduct their operations in Canada. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

Going
Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had million in cash, an accumulated deficit of million, and working capital of million. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was million and we had a net loss of million.
We have not generated revenue to date and have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception.
We have historically funded our operations through issuances of convertible debt, common stock and preferred stock. Our ability to continue
operations after our current cash resources are exhausted depends on future events outside of our control, including our ability to obtain
additional financing or to achieve profitable operations, as to which no assurances can be given. If adequate additional funds are not
available when required, or if our announced merger agreement (see Note 4) is unsuccessful, management may need to curtail planned operations
to conserve cash until sufficient additional capital can be raised. There can be no assurances that such a plan would be successful. 

These
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Due to
our recurring and expected continuing losses from operations, we have concluded there is substantial doubt in our ability to continue
as a going concern within one year of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements without additional capital becoming
available to us. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. 

We
will be required to raise additional capital within the few months to continue to fund operations. We cannot be certain that additional
funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities,
our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact
our ability to conduct business. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to (i)
seek collaborators for our product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or (ii) relinquish
or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize
on unfavorable terms. 

million and million, respectively, consisting of checking accounts held
at U.S. and Canadian commercial banks. At certain times, our cash balances with any one financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation insurance limits. We believe it mitigates our risk by depositing our cash balances with high credit, quality financial
institutions. We have never experienced losses related to these balances.

, respectively, of property and equipment, consisting primarily of
lab equipment, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures. Expenditures for additions, renewals and improvements will be capitalized
at cost. Depreciation will generally be computed on a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
The estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets are years to years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to
operations as incurred. We will periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our
depreciable assets may not be recoverable. There were adjustments to the carrying value of property and equipment at September 30,
2024 or December 31, 2023.

Under
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible
adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. . This could limit the amount of tax attributes that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities.
The amount of the annual limitation, if any, will be determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent
ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. The utilization of these NOLs is subject to limitations based on
past and future changes in our ownership pursuant to Section 382. We completed a Section 382 study of transactions in our stock through
December 31, 2021 and concluded that we have experienced ownership changes since inception that we believe under Section 382 and 383
of the Internal Revenue Code will result in limitations on our ability to use certain pre-ownership change NOLs and credits. We are not
aware of any ownership changes in 2024 or 2023. In addition, we may experience subsequent ownership changes as a result of future equity
offerings or other changes in the ownership of our stock, some of which are beyond our control. As a result, the amount of the NOLs and
tax credit carryforwards presented in our consolidated financial statements could be further limited. Similar provisions of state tax
law may also apply to limit the use of accumulated state tax attributes. 

The
income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0 and million, respectively. The million tax benefit
from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to the sale of our state NOLs related to prior years under the State of New
Jersey s Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program. There was no income tax expense or benefit for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023.

The
Merger is expected to be consummated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The obligation of the parties to consummate the Merger is subject
to various conditions, including, but not limited to: (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other

Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock 

On
October 14, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the sale and issuance of up to shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock (the Series A ). All shares of the Series A were issued between October 2014 and February 2015. Each share of the
Series A is convertible at the option of the holder into the number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the stated value
of such share by the conversion price that is subject to adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares outstanding.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, shares of the Series A were converted. If we sell common stock or equivalents
at an effective price per share that is lower than the conversion price, the conversion price may be reduced to the lower conversion
price. The Series A will be automatically convertible into common stock in the event of a fundamental transaction as defined in the offering. 

Series
C Convertible Preferred Stock Issuance 

On
July 3, 2018, we completed a rights offering pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-1. We offered for sale units
in the rights offering and each unit sold in connection with the rights offering consisted of share of our Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock, or Series C, and common stock warrants (the Rights Offering ). Upon completion of the offering, pursuant to the rights
offering, we sold an aggregate of units at an offering price of per unit comprised of shares of Series C and 
common stock warrants that expired in July 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of Series C outstanding. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares of the Series C were converted into shares of our common stock and during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, share of the Series C was converted into share of our common stock. Each share of Series C is convertible into
common stock at any time at the option of the holder thereof at the conversion price then in effect. The conversion price for the Series
C is determined by dividing the stated value of per share by per share (subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain
dilutive events). 

Common
Stock and Warrant Offering 

On
September 28, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor for the purchase and sale of 
shares of our common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) at a purchase price of per share and pre-funded warrants
to purchase up to shares at a offering price of in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules.
In addition, in a concurrent private placement, we issued to the investor unregistered Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate
of shares of common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock. The Series
A and Series B Warrants will have an exercise price of per share, will be exercisable immediately following the date of issuance
and will expire in years and years, respectively. The closing of the registered direct offering and the concurrent private placement
was on October 3, 2023. We received gross proceeds of million, before deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses
of approximately million that was recorded as general and administrative costs in our consolidated statement of operations. All
of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

We
used the guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, ASC 480 ), ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging ASC
815-40 and ASC 260, Earnings Per Shares ASC 260 to determine the accounting classification for the warrants. 

Based
on this evaluation, we determined that the Warrants are not indexed to our own stock and are precluded from being classified within equity.
Therefore, the Warrants were classified as a liability on the balance sheet, initially recorded at fair value, and then subsequently
will be carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. 

Upon
the issuance of the warrants, the fair value of the warrants was determined to be approximately million resulting in no residual
to allocate to equity and, further, with the excess of the fair value over the proceeds received was recorded as a day one loss of 
million that was recorded to Change in fair value of contingent consideration and derivative financial instruments in the
consolidated statement of operations. 

On
February 16, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with a current warrant holder to exercise the outstanding Series B Warrants
(the Series B Warrant Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Series B Warrant Agreement, the holder agreed to exercise
the Series B Warrant in full and purchase a total of shares of common stock at a reduced price of per share, generating
total gross cash proceeds of .

The
Company accounted for this transaction as a modification and settlement of the Series B Warrant liability. As such, the Company first
recognized a gain of as a result of the change in fair value of the Series B Warrant immediately prior to the modification.
As the modified Series B Warrant was immediately exercisable, the post-modification fair value was determined to be the intrinsic value
of the Series B Warrant at the date of the modification. Therefore, the change in fair value on the date of the modification prior to
the modification compared to the fair value on the date of the modification after the modification, but prior to exercise was determined
to be , which was recorded as an inducement charge, within other expenses in the Company s consolidated statement of operations.
The Company then subsequently reclassified the liability into equity upon settlement. 

As
part of the transaction, the Company incurred equity issuance costs of related to advisory and legal fees directly attributable
to the issuance of the common stock from the Series B Warrant Agreement, which were recorded against additional paid-in-capital. 

In
connection with the offering, the Company agreed to amend, effective upon the closing of this offering, the terms of the October 2023
Series A common stock purchase warrant held by a purchaser in the offering to reduce the exercise price thereof to per share and
to extend the expiration date to February 2029. All of the other terms of the October 2023 Series A common stock purchase warrant will
remain unchanged. 

The
Company accounted for this transaction as a modification of the Series A Warrant liability. As such the Company first recognized a gain
of as a result of the change in fair value of the Series A Warrant immediately prior to the modification. As a result of the
modification, the change in fair value on the date of the modification prior to the modification compared to the fair value on the date
of the modification after the modification, but prior to exercise was an fair value of , which was recorded as an inducement
expense, due to the modification being a result of the Series B Warrant Agreement, and is recorded within the Company s consolidated
statement of operations. 

Additionally,
as part of the Series B Warrant Agreement, we issued to the investor unregistered Series B-1 Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate
of shares of common stock and Series B-2 Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock, collectively
the New Warrant Shares . The Series B-1 and Series B-2 Warrants will have an exercise price of per share, will be
exercisable immediately following the date of issuance and will expire in years and years, respectively. The grant date value of
the New Warrant Shares issued of was recorded as inducement expense within other expenses in the Company s consolidated
statement of operations. 

The
fair value of these liability classified warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This method of valuation
involves using inputs such as the fair value of our common stock, historical volatility, the contractual term of the warrants, risk-free
interest rates and dividend yields. Due to the nature of these inputs, the valuation of the warrants is considered a Level 2 measurement
(see Note 7). The following assumptions were used to measure the Series A and Series B Warrants at modification and to remeasure the
liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and to measure Series B-1 and B-2 at issuance and to remeasure the liability as of
September 30, 2024. Per the warrant agreement, the holders of the warrant have an option to elect to have the unexercised portion of
their warrant repurchased based upon a predetermined formula in as defined in the agreement, which was a at the time of election.
 The repurchase option is only in the case of a Fundamental Transaction
as defined in the agreement (for which the Pharma Two B merger would qualify if it were to close) 

We used an and weighted probability between repurchase value and Black-Scholes, respectively, to remeasure
the liability as of September 30, 2024. The probability percentages are based on the completion of the merger.

The
unrealized gains or losses on the derivative liabilities are recorded as a change in fair value of derivative liabilities- warrants in
our consolidated statement of operations. See Note 4 for a rollforward of the derivative liability for nine months ended September 30,
2024. The financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. At each reporting period, we review the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 815-40. At each
reporting period, all assets and liabilities for which the fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs or instruments
which trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified as Level 3. We classified the derivative liability related to warrants as Level 3, due to the unobservable input related to the
probability weightings of the completion of the merger, used in determining the fair value of the derivative. 

Contingent
consideration was recorded for the acquisition of Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ciclofilin) on June 10, 2016. The contingent consideration
represented the acquisition date fair value of potential future payments, to be paid in cash and our stock, upon the achievement of certain
milestones and was estimated based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model.

grants were made, we did not have any options available for grant under the Plan. We accounted for these option grants as liability-classified
awards requiring us to measure the fair value of the awards each reporting period since there were not enough shares available at the
time of the grant. In April 2023, with the approval of the 2023 Plan, these awards are no longer accounted for as liability-classified
and the cumulative liability of million was recorded to additional paid-in capital. 

In
April 2023, our board of directors approved the 2023 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan), which became effective in June
2023 upon stockholder approval. The 2023 Plan allows for the grant of up to 
awards for the purpose of attracting, motivating and retaining employees (including officers), non-employee directors and
non-employee consultants. On March 6, 2024 pursuant to the 2023 Plan, we granted

We
account for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases , ASC 842 ). We determine if an arrangement is a lease
at contract inception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of identified property or
equipment for a period in exchange for consideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset
in the contract that is land or a depreciable asset (i.e., property and equipment), and (2) the customer has the right to control the
use of the identified asset. 

Operating
leases where we are the lessee are included under the caption Right of Use Assets ROU on our consolidated
balance sheets. The lease liabilities are initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the
lease commencement date. Key estimates and judgments include how we determine (1) the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease
payments to present value, (2) lease term and (3) lease payments. 

The
ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at
or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases,
the ROU asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs,
plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. Lease expense for lease
payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information
appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this
quarterly report contain forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as plan, 
 may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, believe, estimate 
and continue or similar words. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future business
success or financial results. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations
and plans, which contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition or state other forward-looking information.
We believe that it is important to communicate future expectations to investors. However, there may be events in the future that we are
not able to accurately predict or control. Accordingly, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements for
any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. 

The
forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties set forth
under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 16, 2024, as well as under Risk Factors within this
this Form 10-Q. Accordingly, to the extent that this Report contains forward-looking statements regarding the financial condition, operating
results, business prospects or any other aspect of us, please be advised that our actual financial condition, operating results and business
performance may differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in forward-looking statements, and you should not unduly rely
on such statements. 

Overview 

We
are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Edison, New Jersey, previously focused on the development of drug therapy for treatment
of chronic liver diseases. This therapeutic approach targets fibrosis, inflammation, and shows potential for the treatment of hepatocellular
carcinoma HCC associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH ), viral hepatitis, and other liver diseases.
Our cyclophilin inhibitor, rencofilstat (formerly CRV431), was being developed to offer benefits to address multiple complex pathologies
related to the progression of liver disease. 

We
have completed a number of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. In May 2023, we announced that our Phase 2a study ALTITUDE-NASH met its primary endpoint by demonstrating improved liver function and was well tolerated after four months of treatment with once daily
oral rencofilstat administered to NASH subjects with stage 3 or greater fibrosis. All additional secondary efficacy and safety endpoints
were also met. These observations provide further evidence that builds on previous findings from a shorter 28-day Phase 2a AMBITION trial. Taken together, the AMBITION and ALTITUDE-NASH trials reinforced rencofilstat s direct antifibrotic mode of action and increase
our confidence level that we anticipated observing fibrosis reductions in our 12-month Phase 2b ASCEND-NASH clinical
trial. 

In
June 2023, we announced that the Data and Safety Monitoring Board DSMB met to review the current data for the ASCEND-NASH
2b study and has issued a study may proceed without modification clearance. This, the first planned DSMB meeting, occurred
on schedule, and all labs, electrocardiogram s, adverse events, and protocol deviations were reviewed, focusing on any potential
safety signals from the placebo-controlled trial. 

In
December 2023, the board of directors approved a strategic restructuring plan to preserve capital by reducing operating costs. We incurred
a one-time restructuring charge of approximately 0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, we have initiated a process
to explore a range of strategic and financing alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value within the current financial environment
and NASH drug development landscape. On April 19, 2024, we announced that we had begun wind-down activities in our ASCEND- NASH clinical
trial. All clinical trial activities were completed and the trial was closed in August 2024. 

We
are continuing efforts, to the extent that cash is available, to provide any value derived from rencofilstat to our shareholders. 

FINANCIAL
OPERATIONS OVERVIEW 

From
inception through September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of 236.3 million and we have not generated any revenue from operations.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, income taxes and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those described
in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

We
had no revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products
and we do not expect to have such products for several years, if at all. 

Research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.8 million and 8.5 million, respectively. The
decrease of 5.8 million was primarily due to a 4.3 million decrease in clinical trial costs primarily for our phase 2b study, a 1.1
million decrease of Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls costs, a decrease of 0.3 million in employee compensation costs due to reduced
headcounts and other miscellaneous expenses, primarily due to the discontinuation of clinical trials. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, all of the research and development expenses were for clinical
trial costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, 7.9 million of the 0.6 million was for clinical trial
costs and 0.6 million was for pre-clinical costs. Hepion does not expect these expenses to continue after the Merger is completed. 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.7 million and 2.1 million, respectively. The
decrease of 0.5 million was primarily due to a decrease in salaries due to reduced headcount as a result of the discontinuation of clinical trials.

We
had no revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical
products and we do not expect to have such products for several years, if at all. 

Research
and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 12.4 million and 30.2 million, respectively. The
decrease of 17.8 million was primarily due to a 15.6 million decrease in clinical trial costs primarily for our phase 2b study, a 1.8
million decrease of Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls costs, a decrease of 0.4 million in employee compensation costs due to reduced
headcounts, and decrease in consulting and outside services. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 11.6 million of the 12.4 million was for clinical trial
costs and 0.8 million was for pre-clinical costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 28.4 million of the 30.2 million
was for clinical trial costs and 1.8 million was for pre-clinical costs. 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5.7 million and 7.8 million, respectively. The
decrease of 2.1 million was primarily due to a 0.9 million decrease in bonus, salaries and employee benefits, 0.6 million decrease
in stock compensation, 0.2 million decrease in legal fees, 0.3 million in travel expenses, and 0.1 million decrease in insurance. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

We
have funded our operations through September 30, 2024 primarily through the issuance of convertible preferred stock, the issuance and
sale of shares of our common stock and subsequent issuances of shares of our common stock through at-the market offerings. 

Future
Funding Requirements 

We
have no products approved for commercial sale. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing
our company, business planning, raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidate. As a result,
we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2013. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of 236.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. 

We
may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.
The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue.
Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and
working capital. 

25 

 Table of Contents 

We
will require additional financing and a failure to obtain this necessary capital could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate
our operations. 

Since
our inception, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in research and development activities for
our non-replicating and replicating technologies and our product candidates derived from these technologies. We believe that we will
continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with our wind-down of the ASCEND-NASH Trial as well
as our strategic alternatives strategy. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared under the assumption
that we will continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued. Due to our accumulated deficit and
our recurring and expected continuing losses from operations, we have concluded there is substantial doubt in our ability to continue
as a going concern without additional capital becoming available to attain further operating efficiencies and, ultimately, to generate
revenue. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

We
will be required to raise additional capital to continue to fund operations. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available
on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience
significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to (i) seek collaborators
for our product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or (ii) relinquish or otherwise dispose
of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on unfavorable terms. 

Cash
Flows 

The
following table summarizes our cash flows for the following periods: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024 
 2023 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in): 

Operating activities 
 (17,063,429 
 (31,887,104 
 
 Investing activities 
 (600,000 
 13,956 
 
 Financing activities 
 4,349,707 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 0.8 million compared to working capital of 12.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The
decrease of 11.4 million in working capital is primarily due to 3.0 million in proceeds received from sales of our state NOLs offset
by the Company s operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating
Activities: 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 0.8 million in cash. Net cash used in operating activities was 17.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 consisting primarily of our net loss of 11.6 million, adjusted for an increase in non-cash charges of 3.8 million,
primarily for stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, and warrant related inducement expense, partially offset by 6.5
million in change in fair value of contingent consideration and the change in fair value of derivative warrants. Changes in working capital
accounts had a negative impact of 2.7 million on cash primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid
expenses. 

As
of September 30, 2023, we had 19.3 million in cash. Net cash used in operating activities was 31.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 consisting primarily of our net loss of 37.9 million. Changes in non-cash operating activities was 1.1 million,
primarily for stock-based compensation. Changes in working capital accounts had a positive impact of 4.9 million on cash primarily for
a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 3.5 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1.4 million. 

Investing
Activities: 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 600,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and nominal for 2023. The 600,000 in 2024 is primarily due to the note receivable from Pharma Two B. 

26

Financing
Activities: 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to proceeds received
from the exercise of the warrants and equity issuance. 

There
was no cash provided by or used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15, as of September 30, 2024, our Interim Principal Executive Officer/Principal
Financial Officer has concluded that due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting noted below, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Our
 control environment was ineffective because we did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel to execute controls as designed
 including the absence of proper segregation of duties. Such impacted controls include indirect controls affecting the risk assessment
 and monitoring components of COSO along with certain control activities. 

We
 identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to the proper design and implementation of controls over formal review,
 approval, and evaluation of non-core, complex accounting transactions. 

We
 identified a material weakness in internal control related to the proper design and implementation of certain controls over our income
 tax provision and management s review of the income tax provision. We utilize a third-party to assist in the preparation of
 our tax provision. Specifically, we did not sufficiently design and implement controls related to the completeness and accuracy of
 certain aspects of the tax provision and the completeness and accuracy income tax disclosures. 

Remediation
of Material Weaknesses 

We
are committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses described above, as well as the continued improvement of our internal control
over financial reporting. We need to raise additional capital in order to add additional personnel and implement additional internal
control procedures. If we are able to raise additional capital, we plan on implementing several remedial actions to improve our internal
controls, including: 

We
 will need to increase personnel in the future in order to have proper segregation of duties. 

We
 are utilizing the services of external consultants for non-routine and\or technical accounting issues as they arise. 

Expanding
 and improving our review process for complex accounting transactions. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access
 to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications
 and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

Management,
 with the assistance of a third party, will perform an evaluation of the processes and procedures around our tax provision processes,
 internal control design gaps, and recommend process enhancements. 

Implementing
 enhancements and process improvements, including the design and implementation of well-defined controls and related control attributes
 regarding income tax provision and income tax disclosures. 

Developing
 a detailed timeline of the tax provision calculation, to ensure that sufficient time is allocated to complete the process as designed. 

As
we continue our evaluation and improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may identify and take additional measures
to address control deficiencies. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in remediating the material weaknesses in a timely manner. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as noted above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30,
2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for the following: 

The
exchange ratio will not change or otherwise be adjusted based on the market price of our common stock as the exchange ratio depends on
our net cash at the closing and not the market price of our common stock, so the merger consideration at the closing may have a greater
or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed. 

On
July 19, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Pharma Two B Ltd., or Pharma Two B, pursuant
to which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Pharma Two B will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as our
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, referred to hereinafter as the Merger. At the effective time described in the Merger
Agreement, outstanding shares of the Company s common stock will be converted into Pharma Two B ordinary shares. Based on Pharma
Two B s and the Company s capitalization as of July 19, 2024, the exchange ratio is estimated to be equal to 85 to Pharma
Two B and 15 to Hepion shareholders. After applying this estimated exchange ratio and giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
set forth in the PIPE Agreements (the PIPE Investment ), the Company stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger
are expected to own approximately 7.8 of the outstanding ordinary shares of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis, former Pharma
Two B shareholders are expected to own approximately 44.5 of the outstanding ordinary shares of the combined company on a fully-diluted
basis and the investors issued shares of Company Common Stock in the PIPE Investment are expected to own approximately 47.7 of the outstanding
ordinary shares of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis, in each case, subject to certain assumptions, including but not limited
to, that the sum of the Hepion Net Cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement) at Closing and the net proceeds from the PIPE Investment
are at least 10.0 million. In the event such sum is below 10.0 million, the exchange ratio will be adjusted such that the Company s
stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company following the Merger. 

Failure
to complete the merger with Pharma Two B Ltd. could harm our common stock price and future business and operations. 

If
the merger is not completed, we are subject to the following risks: 

the
 price of our common stock may decline and could fluctuate significantly; and 

costs
 related to the merger, such as financial advisor, legal and accounting fees, a majority of which must be paid even if the merger
 is not completed. 

If
the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of Pharma Two B determines to seek another business combination, there
can be no assurance that we will be able to find another third party to transact a business combination with, yielding comparable or
greater benefits. 

If
the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or waived, the merger may not occur. 

Even
if the merger is approved by the stockholders of Pharma Two B, specified conditions must be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, waived to complete the merger. These conditions are set forth in the Merger Agreement. We cannot assure you that all
of the conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger
may not occur or the closing may be delayed. 

The
Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes and
other causes. 

In
general, either Pharma Two B or the Company can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other
party between July 19, 2024, the date of the Merger Agreement, and the Closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either
party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Pharma Two
B or the Company, including: 

any
 change in law, regulatory policies, accounting standards or principles (including GAAP) or any guidance relating thereto or interpretation
 thereof; 

28 

 Table of Contents 

any
 change in interest rates or economic, political, business or financial market conditions generally (including changes in credit,
 financial, commodities, securities or banking markets); 

any
 change generally affecting any of the industries in which Pharma Two B and its subsidiaries or the Company operates or the economy
 as a whole; 

the
 announcement or the execution of the Merger Agreement, the pendency of the transactions contemplated therein, or the performance
 of the Merger Agreement, including, with respect to Pharma Two B and its subsidiaries or the Company, losses or threatened losses
 of employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors or others having relationships with Pharma Two B and its subsidiaries or
 the Company; 

any
 weather conditions, earthquake, hurricane, tsunami, tornado, flood, mudslide, wild fire or other natural disaster, act of God or
 other force majeure event; and 

any
 acts of terrorism, sabotage, war, riot, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or change in geopolitical conditions. 

If
adverse changes occur and Pharma Two B and the Company still complete the Merger, the combined company s share price may suffer.
This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the shareholders of Pharma Two B, the Company or both. 

If
Pharma Two B and the Company complete the Merger, the combined company will need to raise additional capital by issuing equity securities
or additional debt or through licensing arrangements, which may cause significant dilution to the combined company s shareholders
or restrict the combined company s operations. 

On
July 19, 2024, the Pharma Two B entered into the PIPE Agreements with certain investors, including existing investors of Pharma Two B,
pursuant to which the investors agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 11.5 million in shares of the combined company ordinary shares.
The closing of the PIPE Investment is conditioned upon the closing of the Merger, as well as certain other conditions such that the ordinary
shares of the combined company issued in the PIPE Investment will result in dilution to all securityholders of the combined company (i.e.,
both former Company securityholders and Pharma Two B securityholders). 

Even
if the PIPE Investment closes as expected, the combined company will need to raise additional capital in the future. Additional financing
may not be available to the combined company when it is needed or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that the combined
company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, such financing will cause additional dilution to all securityholders
holders of the combined company, including former Company securityholders, Pharma Two B securityholders and purchasers in the PIPE Investment.
It is also possible that the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the combined company s ordinary shares.
Any debt financing into which the combined company enters may involve covenants that restrict operations. These restrictive covenants
may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the combined company s assets, as well
as prohibitions on its ability to grant liens, pay dividends, redeem its shares or make investments. In addition, if the combined company
raises additional funds through licensing arrangements, the terms of such arrangements may not be favorable to the combined company. 

Some
of our directors have interests in the Merger that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the Merger
without regard to your interests. 

Some
of our directors may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of other of our stockholders
generally. These interests with respect to our directors may include, among others, acceleration of stock option or restricted stock
unit vesting, retention bonus payments, extension of exercisability periods of previously issued stock option grants, and rights to continued
indemnification, expense advancement and insurance coverage. In connection with the Merger, each option to purchase shares of Company
common stock held by the Company s directors as of the effective time will vest in full upon the closing of the merger. Two members
of the Company s board of directors, Dr. Timothy Block and Michael Purcell, will continue as directors of the combined company
after the effective time, and, following the closing of the Merger, will be eligible to be compensated as non-employee directors of the
combined company. 

In
addition, certain current members of Pharma Two Bs board of directors will continue as directors of the combined company after
the effective time, and, following the closing of the merger, will be eligible to be compensated as non-employee directors of the combined
company pursuant to our non-employee director compensation policy that is expected to remain in place following the effective time. 

29 

 Table of Contents 

Our
board of directors was aware of and considered those interests, among other matters, in reaching their decisions to approve and adopt
the Merger Agreement, approve the merger, and recommend the approval of the Merger Agreement to our stockholders. These interests, among
other factors, may have influenced the directors and executive officers of each company to support or approve the merger. 

Our
stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with
the Merger, including the conversion of Company common stock issued in the pre-closing financing. 

If
the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger, our stockholders
will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving
part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits
currently anticipated from the merger. 

If
the merger is not completed, our stock price may decline significantly. 

The
market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of pharmaceutical, biotechnology
and other life science companies have historically been particularly volatile. In addition, the market price of our common stock will
likely be volatile based on whether stockholders and other investors believe that we can complete the merger or otherwise raise additional
capital to support our operations if the merger is not consummated and another strategic transaction cannot be identified, negotiated
and consummated in a timely manner, if at all. The volatility of the market price of our common stock has been and may be exacerbated
by low trading volume. 

Our
securityholders will generally have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management
of, the combined company following the completion of the Merger as compared to their current ownership and voting interests in the respective
companies. 

After
the completion of the Merger, our current stockholders will generally own a smaller percentage of the combined company than their ownership
of our company prior to the Merger. Immediately after the Merger, and immediately prior to the PIPE investment, our stockholders are
expected to own approximately 15 of the outstanding shares of the combined company. After the PIPE investment, our stockholders are
expected to own approximately 7.8 of the outstanding shares of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis, subject to certain assumptions.
Under certain circumstances further described in the Merger Agreement, the ownership percentages may be adjusted up or down including
depending on the amount of cash on our balance sheet at Closing. 

During
the pendency of the Merger, we may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party on more favorable terms because
of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective business prospects. 

Covenants
in the Merger Agreement impede our ability to make acquisitions during the pendency of the Merger, subject to specified exceptions. As
a result, if the Merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during that period. In addition,
while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, seeking, initiating or knowingly encouraging,
inducing or facilitating the communication, making, submission or announcement of any acquisition proposal or acquisition inquiry or
taking any action that could reasonably be expected to lead to certain transactions involving a third party, including a merger, sale
of assets or other business combination, subject to specified exceptions. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party s
stockholders, but the parties may be unable to pursue them.
