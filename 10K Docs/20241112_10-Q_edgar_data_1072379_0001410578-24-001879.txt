 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company used approximately million of cash in its operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company does not expect to generate material revenue in the near future from the sale of products and is subject to all of the risks and uncertainties that are typically faced by biotechnology companies that devote substantially all of their efforts to research and development R D and clinical trials and do not yet have commercial products. The Company expects to continue incurring annual losses for the foreseeable future. The Company s existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund its operations, anticipated capital expenditures, working capital and other financing requirements until the Company reaches significant revenues. Until that time, the Company will need to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing, especially if the Company experiences downturns in its business that are more severe or longer than anticipated, or if the Company experiences significant increases in expense levels resulting from being a publicly-traded company or from expansion of operations. If the Company attempts to obtain additional equity or debt financing, the Company cannot assume that such financing will be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all. Because of recurring operating losses and operating cash flow deficits, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of this filing. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, however, they do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The Company has also executed a new SOW #8 covering the work required to establish the DCVax-Direct program in the U.K. and manufacture DCVax-Direct products for global use (see Note 13). Each of the operational programs is covered by a separate contract. The ongoing manufacturing in the London facility is covered by a Manufacturing Services Agreement MSA entered into on May 14, 2018. The development and manufacturing program at the Sawston facility is covered by an Ancillary Services Agreement entered into on November 18, 2019. Each periodic specialized program is covered by an SOW that sets forth the role and activities to be undertaken by Advent for that program, and provides for milestone payments upon completion of key elements of the program. The Ancillary Services Agreement establishes a structure under which the Company and Advent negotiate and agree upon the scope and terms for Statements of Work SOWs for facility development activities and compassionate use program activities, as well as for the periodic specialized programs. After an SOW is agreed and approved by the Company, Advent will proceed with, or continue, the applicable services and will invoice the Company pursuant to the SOW. Since both the facility development and the compassionate use program involve pioneering and uncertainties in most aspects, the invoicing under the Ancillary Services Agreement is on the basis of costs incurred plus percent.

 Advent BioServices Sublease Agreement On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Sub-lease Agreement (the Agreement with Advent. The Agreement permits use by Advent of a portion of the space in the Sawston facility, which is leased by the Company under a separate head lease with a different counterparty (Huawei) that commenced on December 14, 2018. The Company subleased approximately square feet of the square foot building interior space, plus corresponding support space and parking. The lease payments amount under the Agreement are times the amount payable by the Company under the head lease (which is currently or approximately per square foot based on exchange rate as of September 30, 2024), but subject to a cap of per square foot. Accordingly, the monthly lease payments under the Sublease are based on annually for 2024. The total lease payments paid by the Company to Huawei for the square foot facility, exterior spaces and parking under the head lease are (approximately per year. The term of the Agreement shall end on the same date as the head lease term ends. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized sub-lease income of and , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized sub-lease income of and , respectively.

 to account for each separate lease component of a contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component, thus causing all fixed payments to be capitalized. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients permitted within the new standard, which among other things, allows the Company to carry forward historical lease classification. The lease renewal options have not been included in the calculation of the lease liabilities and right-of-use ROU assets as the Company has not yet determined whether to exercise the options. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the ROU assets or liabilities. These are expensed as incurred and recorded as variable lease expense. On August 22, 2024, the Company extended its office lease in the U.S for additional under an amended agreement. The Company recognized additional million ROU assets and lease liabilities for its amended office lease in the U.S. At September 30, 2024, the Company had operating lease liabilities of approximately million for both the lease of the building for the manufacturing facility in Sawston, U.K., and the current office lease in the U.S. and ROU assets of approximately million for the Sawston lease and U.S. office lease are included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The MSA provides for manufacturing of DCVax-L products at an existing facility in London. The MSA is structured in the same manner as the Company s prior agreements with Cognate BioServices. The MSA provides for certain payments for achievement of milestones and, as was the case under the prior agreement with Cognate BioServices, the Company is required to pay certain fees for dedicated production capacity reserved exclusively for DCVax production and pay for manufacturing of DCVax-L products for a certain minimum number of patients, whether or not the Company fully utilizes the dedicated capacity and number of patients. The MSA remains in force until five years after the first commercial sales of DCVax-L products pursuant to a marketing authorization, accelerated approval or other commercial approval, unless cancelled. Either party may terminate the MSA on notice, to allow for transition arrangements by both parties. During the notice period services would still be provided. Minimum required payments for this notice period are anticipated to total approximately million million). German Tax Matter The German tax authorities have audited our wholly owned subsidiary, NW Bio GmbH, for 2013-2015. The NW Bio GmbH submitted substantial documentation to refute certain aspects of the assessments and the German tax authorities agreed in principle with the Company s proposed revised approach and settlement offer. A final settlement bill was received from the German Tax Authority confirming that only a portion of the original bill was owed, (approximately ), for corporate taxes, interest, and reduced penalty for the period under audit, which the Company paid on September 2, 2021. The Company also received and paid the final settlement bill from the local authority for trade taxes for the audit period in the amount of (approximately ). On November 4, 2021, the Company received a letter from the local tax authorities asking for additional late fees of (approximately on reimbursable withholding taxes that had been waived during the settlement process. On December 8, 2021, the Company appealed the assessment of additional late fees. Additionally, the Company requested that NW Bio GmbH be deregistered from the trade register, as it no longer had current operations. The deregistration was granted effective December 31, 2021. Between January 2022 and July 2022, the Company received tax bills for the corporate and trade taxes for the 2016-2020 tax years that totaled approximately (approximately ). On July 27, 2022, the Company was informed that the German Tax Authorities were prepared to waive (approximately of the penalties. The Company offered to pay this reduced penalty if an extended payment plan was approved. A response was received dated November 14, 2022 indicating that the tax authority would not be able to grant a further deferral of payment of these penalties. In a letter dated December 27, 2022, the Leipzig tax authority sent letters to the former and current managing directors of NW Bio GmbH giving 30 days to respond to a tax liability questionnaire. Based on the responses to the liability questionnaires the tax authorities have currently not directed any further measures against former and current managing directors of NW Bio GmbH with respect to tax liability proceedings. On October 12, 2023 and January 16, 2024, the Company made (approximately and (approximately payments, respectively, regarding to the late payment penalty. As of September 30, 2024, the Company accrued for trade tax liability of (approximately and corporation tax of (approximately ). Based on the Company s current operating state in Germany and the negotiations, the Company believes, based on its evaluation under ASC 740, that the resolution of these tax matters will not likely result in a net material charge to the Company.

 related to a gain contingency. In addition, the Company exchanged million from a previously executed non - dilutive financial instrument to a new convertible note (see Note 7). These agreements are accounted for under ASC 470 and are recognized as contingent payment obligations on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company s payment obligations only apply when such are received by the Company. million in funding from the sale of common shares, proceeds from warrant exercise, and proceeds of debt arrangements. Between October 1, 2024 and November 8, 2024, the Company issued approximately million shares of common stock for proceeds of million. On October 18, 2024, the Company entered into a Commercial Loan Agreement (the October Commercial Loan with a commercial lender for an aggregate principal amount of million. The October Commercial Loan bears interest at per annum with a -month term. There are no principal repayments during the first eight months of the term. The October Commercial Loan is amortized in installments starting on June 18, 2025. The October Commercial Loan carries an original issue discount of million. Between October 1, 2024 and November 8, 2024, the Company entered into several -year convertible notes (the Convertible Notes with multiple individual investors (the Holders with an aggregate principal amount of million. The Convertible Notes bear interest at per annum and are convertible into common shares between and per share at the Holder s sole option. In addition, the Holders have an alternative option to convert the Convertible Notes into a non-dilutive financial instrument, which has the same terms at those in the non-dilutive funding agreements as described in Note 12. Between October 1, 2024 and November 8, 2024, the Company issued approximately million shares of common stock to certain lenders in lieu of cash payments of million of debt. The Company also issued million shares of common stock to extinguish million outstanding share liability. On November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Statement of Work #8 SOW 8 with Advent that will be incorporated into the Ancillary Services Agreement that was originally entered into dated November 8, 2019 and was extended on July 8, 2024. SOW 8 covers the work required to establish the DCVax-Direct program in the U.K and manufacture DCVax-Direct products for global use. Under SOW 8, the compensation consists solely of one-time milestones for each stage of the work and Advent will only receive the compensation when the applicable work is successfully completed. (When the Company previously contracted with a different company for restart of DCVax-Direct manufacturing, the contract required payment for work performed, regardless of whether the work was successful or not, as is typical for such contract services. The other company did not succeed in producing any DCVax-Direct products meeting the specifications.) SOW 8 includes 5 one-time milestones with corresponding milestone payments: (a) Basic Technology Transfer, New SOPs Regulatory Documents . Review of documents, specifications and data from prior DCVax-Direct program conducted by Cognate BioServices. Development of a new set of SOPs for DCVax-Direct production in Sawston and new regulatory documents for the UK. Initial implementation in Sawston; many engineering runs.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included with this report. In addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. The words believe, expect, intend, anticipate, and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements, but some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. Many factors could affect our actual results, including those factors described under Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II Item 1A of this report. These factors, among others, could cause results to differ materially from those presently anticipated by us. You should not rely upon on these forward-looking statements. Overview We are a biotechnology company focused on developing personalized immune therapies for cancer. We have developed a platform technology, DCVax , which uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient s own immune system to attack their cancer. Our lead product, DCVax -L, is designed to treat solid tumor cancers in which the tumor can be surgically removed. We have completed a 331-patient international Phase III trial of DCVax-L for Glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer (GBM), published the results in the JAMA Oncology peer reviewed journal, and on December 20, 2023 we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for commercial approval in the U.K. We plan to conduct clinical trials of DCVax-L for other solid tumor cancers in the future, when resources permit. Our second product, DCVax -Direct, is designed to treat inoperable solid tumors. A 40-patient Phase I trial has been completed, and included treatment of a diverse range of more than a dozen types of cancers. We plan to work on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct as resources permit. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company continued its progress on multiple fronts, including the following. MAA Application and Inspections . The Company has continued to work with multiple teams of expert consultants, the trial s CRO (contract research organization) and Advent BioServices on the MAA process. The review of the application is ongoing, and inspections are being conducted in the U.K and the U.S. Each inspection involves pre-inspection requests from the inspectors for production of extensive documents and information, weeklong onsite inspections (including review of further documents, interviews of personnel, checking of facilities and procedures, etc.), and ongoing follow-up document and information requests after the onsite inspection. The inspections cover the sponsor, the CRO, the independent experts involved in the trial (such as the independent clinical database company, independent statisticians and others), selected trial site hospitals and their pharmacies, and others. As is typical, and as the Company has previously stated, the Company does not plan to make any interim announcements while its MAA is going through the regulatory process. The Company plans to announce the results when the regulatory review and decision-making is finished. Reimbursement. The Company has evaluated and selected specialized, highly experienced consultants with whom to undertake preparations for a potential reimbursement review and evaluation process. The Company has executed the relevant contracts and is under way with the first stage of the process with the consultants. The preparations for the reimbursement process will involve several stages and include health economics and outcomes (HEO) analyses, analyses of the relevant clinical landscape, engagement with experts and stakeholders, and other steps. Collaborations: Private Clinics . As previously reported, the Company has been working over the last couple of years and during this year to develop certain clinical collaborations. These include joint efforts by the Company and Advent BioServices to establish collaborations with several private clinics in the U.K. The collaborations with private clinics are designed to achieve several goals. One goal is to establish dedicated leukapheresis units which will be available for NWBio patients at all times. This is quite important for scale-up of the numbers of patients who can be handled for NWBio s treatments, because there is a country-wide shortage of leukapheresis capacity in the U.K. Another goal of the clinic collaborations is to potentially be able to conduct clinical trials with these private clinics as trial sites and be able to treat compassionate use patients patients with diverse types of solid tumors, in addition to patients with brain cancer. The joint efforts have now reached or are reaching fruition. A contract has been executed with one private clinic for a dedicated leukapheresis unit there, and the focus is now on arrangements for the medical personnel and training. A Letter of Intent has been completed with a second private clinic, and the full contract is in process, for both a dedicated leukapheresis unit and treatment of patients. Arrangements have been made with a third private clinic for treatment of patients, and the first such patient is in process.

 Collaborations: Complementary or Synergistic Technologies. The Company has also been pursuing ongoing efforts to identify and develop collaborations with other companies who have technologies that the Company believes may be complementary to the Company s DCVax technologies (for example for combination treatment regimens) or may be synergistic with the Company s technologies (for example, to enhance DCVax products). The Company completed negotiations and entered into a contract with a company that has a complementary immunotherapy agent, and the two companies have been engaged for a number of months in joint development of trial designs and selection of candidate cancers for a combination treatment clinical trial. The companies are particularly focusing on trial designs in which the primary endpoint will be tumor response (shrinkage), with potential timeframes in months, rather than time-to-event survival outcomes, with timeframes in years. The Company anticipates potentially being ready to submit an IND for such a combination trial to regulators during Q1 of next year. The Company has also completed negotiations and entered into a contract with a company that has an immune booster agent that may have the potential to further increase the potency of DCVax products. The contract provides for material supply and in vitro testing of the booster agent with DCVax products. If the in vitro testing is successful, the parties plan to enter into a license of the booster agent to NWBio. The parties jointly designed the program of experiments, and the experiments were carried out and completed by the Flaskworks team. The parties are now evaluating the results and developing plans for further experiments. Re-Start of the DCVax-Direct Clinical Program . As previously reported, preparations to restart clinical development of DCVax-Direct have been under way for quite a while. The Company currently anticipates that the DCVax-Direct program will be able to restart by the end of January. For the same reasons as described above in connection with the planned combination treatment trial, the Company plans to focus DCVax-Direct clinical trial designs on tumor response endpoints with potential timeframes of months rather than survival endpoints with timepoints of years. The preparations to date involve technology transfer to the U.K, development of new SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and regulatory documents, engineering runs and comparability testing. In addition, new development work has been carried out to develop a second version of DCVax-Direct because there is a worldwide shortage of one key ingredient of the original DCVax-Direct (an immune booster ingredient). The Company and Advent have been working together to evaluate other potential immune booster agents -- both their properties in the manufacturing process and their effects immunologically -- to identify an alternative booster agent that can be suitable and is available for production of new batches of DCVax-Direct. Advent is continuing to conduct final engineering runs for validation of the new SOPs, processes and formulation. The Company has entered into SOW 8 with Advent covering the work involved in restarting the DCVax-Direct program. SOW 8 is structured so that Advent only receives compensation for the work in the form of milestone payments and only after the applicable work has been successfully completed (see Note 13). Ongoing and Expanded Phase 2 Clinical Trials Under the Roswell Pittsburgh Portfolios . As previously reported, the Company entered into exclusive licenses from Roswell Park Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburgh, covering a large portfolio dendritic cell technologies developed over the course of more than 27 years of work by a leading team of dendritic cell experts, as well as 5 new patent families. The in-licensed technologies in the combined portfolios are currently in three Phase 2 clinical trials that are fully funded by grants and fully being carried out by the investigators. These Phase 2 trials are ongoing and one of them has been approved for a significant expansion in scope by the grant funding agency. That trial is testing an in-licensed dendritic cell treatment in melanoma that is refractory (unresponsive) to checkpoint inhibitor drugs. That dendritic cell treatment aims at a set of targets on abnormal blood vessels that are associated with tumors. As such, that dendritic cell treatment is anticipated to be tumor-agnostic and potentially applicable to most types of solid tumors. The expansion of the trial scope that has been approved is to add refractory lung, breast and bladder cancers to the trial in addition to refractory melanoma. Intellectual Property . The Company s intellectual property (IP) portfolio continued to grow during Q3 2024, complementing the Company s growing pipeline. Patents from 3 different patent families developed by the Company were granted or allowed in several countries, particularly Europe. Patents from 2 different patent families which are part of the Roswell and Pittsburgh in-licenses were granted in the U.S. and elsewhere. New divisional applications were also filed to extend the scope of patents from 2 different patent families, in Europe and elsewhere. In regard to the Flaskworks technologies and IP, 5 new patents were allowed in the U.S. and elsewhere, from 4 different patent families, during Q3 2024. In addition, 4 new patents were issued in the U.S. during Q3 2024, which had been allowed during Q2 2024, and a 5 th patent elsewhere was also issued. The Company believes that the ongoing expansion of its IP portfolio is an important and valuable part of building a leading franchise in dendritic cell technologies. Litigation . In the Company s lawsuit against certain market makers, the Company is awaiting the Magistrate s Report and Recommendation on the last remaining element to be evaluated regarding the sufficiency of the Company s Complaint: i.e., loss causation. The Magistrate and the Court already previously determined that all but this one of the required elements were sufficiently alleged in the Company s Complaint, and the Court invited the Company to file expanded allegations about the loss causation element. The Company submitted expanded claims earlier this year, the parties filings were finished in June, and the parties are now waiting to receive the Magistrate s recommendation.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to derivative liabilities, accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies and significant estimates are detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our critical accounting policies and significant estimates have not changed substantially from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Results of Operations Operating costs: Our operating costs and expenses consist primarily of research and development (R D) expenses. R D expenses include clinical trial expenses, and increased costs after completion of a Phase III trial, especially for the extensive preparations, and teams of expert consultants, required for an application for product approval. In addition to clinical trial and post-trial costs, our operating costs may include ongoing work relating to our DCVax products, including R D, product characterization, manufacturing process development, quality control process development, and related matters. Additional substantial costs relate to the development and expansion of manufacturing capacity. Our operating costs also include the costs of preparations for the launch of new or expanded clinical trial programs, such as our anticipated trials of combination treatment regimens. The preparation costs include payments to regulatory consultants, lawyers, statisticians, sites and others, evaluation of potential investigators, the clinical trial sites and the CROs managing the trials and other service providers, and expenses related to institutional approvals, clinical trial agreements (business contracts with sites), training of medical and other site personnel, trial supplies and other. Our operating costs also include legal and accounting costs in operating the Company. The foregoing operating costs include the costs for Flaskworks ongoing operations and intellectual property filings, and the operations of our subsidiaries in the U.K., the Netherlands and Germany. Research and development: R D expenses include costs for substantial external scientific personnel, technical and regulatory advisers, and others, costs of laboratory supplies used in our internal research and development projects, travel, regulatory compliance, and expenditures for preclinical and clinical trial operation and management when we are actively engaged in clinical trials. Because we are a pre-revenue company, we do not allocate R D costs on a project basis. We adopted this policy, in part, due to the unreasonable cost burden associated with accounting at such a level of detail and our limited number of financial and personnel resources. General and administrative: General and administrative expenses include personnel related salary and benefit expenses, cost of facilities, insurance, travel, legal services, property and equipment and amortization of stock options and warrants.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 We recognized a net loss of 19.4 million and 23.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Research and Development Expense For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were 8.1 million and 7.2 million, respectively. The increase in 2024 was mainly related to an increase of 1.2 million cost incurred from Advent with extensive ongoing work related to the MAA and review process, which was offset by a decrease of 0.5 million related to stock-based compensation. General and Administrative Expense For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 7.0 million and 7.0 million, respectively. Change in Fair Value of Derivatives We recognized a non-cash loss of 1.6 million and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The loss was primarily due to the change of valuation inputs. The healthcare market yield curve rate that was used in the pricing model was significantly decreased as of September 30, 2024 compared to the value as of June 30, 2024. The rate was about the same level as of September 30, 2023 compared to the value as of June 30, 2023. Change in Fair Value of Convertible Notes We recognized a non-cash gain of 3.1 million and a non-cash loss of 4.9 million change in fair value of the convertible notes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The non-cash gain was resulted from the decrease of the Company s stock price and the non-cash loss was resulted from the increase of the Company s stock price. Debt Extinguishment We recognized approximately 6.8 million and 1.8 million debt extinguishment loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from debt redemptions and debt amendments, respectively. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to last year was due to multiple amendments on the existing convertible notes which resulted a debt extinguishment loss of 5.6 million. Interest Expense During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized interest expense of 2.1 million and 1.7 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2024 was mainly related to an increase of outstanding debt balance. Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized foreign currency transaction gain of 2.8 million and a loss of 1.7 million, respectively. The gain was due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar and vice versa for the loss. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 We recognized a net loss of 55.6 million and 48.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Research and Development Expense For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were 24.4 million and 20.3 million, respectively. The increase in 2024 was mainly related to an increase of 2.6 million to unrelated external service providers primarily related to the MAA, the review process and inspections, of which 1.1 million was related to stock-based compensation, which was mainly related to additional awards that were granted to various key external consultants in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, research and development expenses from Advent was increased by 1.4 million with extensive ongoing work related to the MAA and review process for the nine months ended in September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of last year. General and Administrative Expense For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 24.8 million and 21.6 million, respectively. The increase in 2024 was primarily related to an increase of 3.2 million in legal expenses. Change in Fair Value of Derivatives We recognized non-cash gain of 0.9 million and 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher gain in 2023 was mainly due to the non-cash revaluation gain recognized as of January 9, 2023, when we reclassed all warrants from liability classified to equity classified. The stock price on January 9, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 0.71 and 0.78 per share, respectively. Change in Fair Value of Convertible Notes We recognized a non-cash gain of 4.6 million and non-cash loss of 4.9 million in change in fair value of the convertible notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The gain was primarily due to the decrease of stock price as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The loss was primarily due to the increase in the stock price as of September 30, 2023 compared to the stock price on the issuance date during August and September 2023. Debt Extinguishment We recognized approximately 9.9 million and 3.6 million debt extinguishment loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from the debt redemption and debt amendments, respectively. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to last year was mainly due to multiple amendments on the existing convertible notes which resulted a debt extinguishment loss of 5.6 million. Interest Expense During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded interest expense of 5.3 million and 4.0 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2024 was mainly related to an increase of outstanding debt balance. Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized foreign currency transaction gain of 2.0 million and loss of 0.1 million, respectively. The gain was due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar and vice versa for the loss. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have experienced recurring losses from operations since inception. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues and must cover our operating expenses through debt and equity financings to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on the ability to obtain adequate capital to fund operating losses until we generate adequate cash flows from operations to fund our operating costs and obligations. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations.

 We depend upon our ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure equity and/or debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our management determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the annual consolidated financial statements were issued, and management s concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern within the year following this report persist. Cash Flow Operating Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash outflows from operations were approximately 36.8 million and 36.7 million, respectively. The slight increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase payment in legal costs. Investing Activities We spent approximately 0.9 million and 3.0 million in cash for the purchase of additional equipment and our build-out in Sawston, UK during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Financing Activities We received approximately 8.2 million of cash from issuance of 0.8 million shares of Series C convertible preferred stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received approximately 9.9 million cash from issuance of 0.7 million shares of Series C convertible preferred stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We received approximately 10.0 million net proceeds from issuance of 33.5 million shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received approximately 9.9 million of cash from issuance of convertible notes to individual lenders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received approximately 12.7 million of cash from issuance of convertible notes to individual lenders during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We received approximately 10.0 million and 10.0 million of cash from the issuance of a loan from a commercial lender during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also received 2.0 million of cash from the issuance of a demand note to an individual investor during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received approximately 1.5 million and 1.6 million of cash from the exercise of warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We received 50,000 from issuance of non-dilutive funding agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received 4.6 million from issuance of non-dilutive funding agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We made aggregate debt payments of 1.1 million and 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other factors affecting our ongoing funding requirements include the number of staff we employ, the number of sites, number of patients and amount of activity in our clinical trial programs, the costs of further product and process development work relating to our DCVax products, the costs of preparations for Phase II trials, the costs of expansion of manufacturing, and unanticipated developments. The extent of resources available to us will determine which programs can move forward and at what pace. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may result from the change in value of financial instruments due to fluctuations in its market price. Market risk is inherent in all financial instruments. Market risk may be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and/or at normal bid-offer spreads. Our exposure to market risk is directly related to derivatives, debt and equity linked instruments related to our financing activities. Our assets and liabilities are overwhelmingly denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage changes in currency rates. We do not now, nor do we plan to, use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. However, these circumstances might change. The primary quantifiable market risk associated with our financial instruments is sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates. We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive financial instruments will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree. We do not believe that our cash and equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. The sensitivity analyses of the interest rate sensitive financial instruments are hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on a 1 or 2 variation in an estimate generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the estimate to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular estimate on the fair value of financial instruments is calculated independent of changes in any other estimate; in practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in another factor, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. In addition, the sensitivity analyses do not consider any action that we may take to mitigate the impact of any adverse changes in the key estimates. Based on our analysis, as of September 30, 2024, the effect of a 100+/- basis point change in interest rates on the value of our financial instruments and the resultant effect on our net loss are considered immaterial.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2024, of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such terms are defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Remediation of a Past Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company recognizes the importance of internal controls to ensure accurate financial reporting. Consequently, we designed and implemented remediation measures to address the material weakness previously identified during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which was due solely to the material weakness over the valuation of debt and derivative liabilities which primarily involved applying an incorrect valuation method using the market price actually paid for certain convertible notes rather than using a Monte Carlo valuation formula. In light of the material weakness, we enhanced our valuation of debt and derivative liability processes. Based on the actions taken, as well as the evaluation of the design of the new controls, management concluded that the material weakness was remediated as of March 31, 2024 and were operating effectively as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent quarter with respect to our operations, which materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings On December 1, 2022, we filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain market makers. The Complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in manipulation of the Company s stock, in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and common law fraud, over a period of years. On March 20, 2023, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. On April 10, 2023 we filed an Amended Complaint against Canaccord Genuity LLC, Citadel Securities LLC, G1 Execution Services LLC, GTS Securities LLC, Instinet LLC, Lime Trading Corp., and Virtu Americas LLC (Northwest Biotherapeutics Inc. v. Canaccord, et al., No. 1:22-cv-10185-GHW-GWG). Following defendant s filing of a new Motion to Dismiss (MTD) and various filings on both sides, an oral argument on defendants latest Motion to Dismiss was held on November 14, 2023. The Magistrate Judge issued an 85-page Recommendation and Results Opinion (R R) for review by the Senior Judge. The Magistrate Judge found that the Company had adequately plead all of the elements of its claim of market manipulation, with the exception of producing enough details for calculating actual damages, known as loss causation. On that basis, he granted defendant s motion to dismiss without prejudice, subject to the Company s right to replead on just the question of loss causation, finding that such a filing would not be futile . On February 14, 2024, the Senior Judge issued an opinion accepting all the recommendations and findings of the R R, and gave the Company 30 days to file this limited repleading amendment on loss causation and damages no later than March 15, 2024. On March 15, 2024, the Company filed their more detailed repleading on loss causation and damages. At the end of March, defendants asked for the right to object to the Judge s findings against them on December 29, 2023 and February 14, 2024. This motion was denied. The defendants then asked for leave to file a new MTD. That motion was granted with a 30-day filing requirement for defendants and a 30-day response time for the Company. On May 1, 2024, the defendants filed a new MTD the Company s amended repleading complaint, containing the new section on loss causation and damages. On May 31, 2024, the Company responded to the defendants new MTD, supporting the Magistrate Judge s and Senior Judge s previous opinions, and rejecting the defendants objections to the Company s loss causation repleading and damage formulae. On June 14, 2024, the defendants filed their last response to the Company s comments on May 31, 2024, concerning the defendant s latest MTD. They also asked the Court to schedule an oral argument on the issues raised by these last two filings. There have been no further developments in the case since June. The parties are awaiting the Magistrate s report and recommendation on loss causation. The Company plans to continue vigorously pursuing this case. As previously reported, three stockholders filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery three similar derivative lawsuits against the Company and certain of its directors and officers, including J. Cofer Black, Marnix L. Bosch, Alton L. Boynton, Leslie J. Goldman, Jerry Jasinowski, Navid Malik, and Linda F. Powers (the Individual Defendants ), alleging the Individual Defendants (i) breached their fiduciary duties, and (ii) were unjustly enriched by director and officer compensation awarded in 2020 to the Individual Defendants notwithstanding the fact that approximately 90 of shareholders voted to approve the Company s executive compensation (the same compensation that these three stockholders are seeking to challenge) twice (both through its Say on Pay vote at the Company s Annual Meeting in 2021, and again in a binding vote at the Company s Annual Meeting in 2022) and approximately 90 of shareholders also voted to approve the director awards at the 2022 Annual Meeting. On March 31, 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated these actions into a single action under the caption In re Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. Stockholder Litigation (the Derivative Action ). The descriptions and summary of the lawsuit herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the proceedings in the Derivative Action, and are described in greater detail by the Company s June 3, 2024 Definitive Proxy (the 2024 Proxy ). On December 30, 2022, following the shareholder approvals at the December 2022 Annual Meeting, the Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint asserting that the shareholder votes should be deemed ineffective. On February 22, 2023, the Individual Defendants and the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. On November 17, 2023, the court issued an oral decision denying the Motion to Dismiss. On December 20, 2023, the Company filed an answer to the Consolidated Amended Complaint. On December 28, 2023, the Individual Defendants, represented by separate counsel, filed their response to the Consolidated Amended Complaint.

 On June 3, 2024, the Company filed the 2024 Proxy which, among other things, asked shareholders to ratify the 2020 option awards that are the subject of the Derivative Action at the Company s 2024 annual meeting of shareholders (the 2024 Annual Meeting ). On June 20, 2024, the court stayed proceedings in the Derivative Action in light of the potential ratifying effects of the 2024 Annual Meeting. At the Company s 2024 Annual Meeting, held on June 29, 2024, shareholders holding 88.13 of the shares voted in favor of Proposal 3 (ratification of the 2020 option awards granted to the Company s four senior executives) and stockholders holding 88.05 of the shares voted in favor of Proposal 4 (ratification of the 2020 option awards granted to the Company s non-employee directors). On June 30, 2024, the Individual Defendants filed an amended answer to the Consolidated Amended Complaint and have asserted that the claims in the Derivative Action are barred, in whole or in part, by ratification because the Company s disinterested stockholders ratified the challenged option awards at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The parties are currently seeking guidance from the court regarding the proceedings. On October 31, 2024, the Court gave approval for the parties to file summary judgment motions regarding the effectiveness of stockholder ratification. The Court also permitted discovery regarding ratification. Item 1A. Risk Factors Applicable risk factors are set forth in the Company s report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not Applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information .
