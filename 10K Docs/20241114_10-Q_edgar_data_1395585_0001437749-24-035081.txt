In first quarter 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and all related guidance dealing with the FASB s pronouncements dealing with changes in accounting for and recognizing credit losses. 

Fixed maturity securities comprised of bonds and redeemable preferred securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity. 

Interest income on fixed maturity securities, as well as the related amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is included in net investment income under the effective yield method. Dividend income on redeemable preferred securities are recognized in net investment income when declared. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale are written down to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. 

The Company evaluates the difference between the cost or amortized cost and estimated fair value of its fixed maturity securities to determine whether any decline in value is the result of a credit loss or other factors. An allowance for credit losses is recorded against available-for-sale securities to reflect the amount of an unrealized loss attributed to credit. This impairment is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any remaining unrealized loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) with no change to the cost basis of the security. This determination involves a degree of uncertainty. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recognized in earnings. 

The assessment and determination of whether or not a credit loss exists is based on consideration of the cash flows expected to be collected from the fixed maturity security. The Company develops those expectations after considering various factors such as agency ratings, the financial condition of the issuer or underlying obligors, payment history, payment structure of the security, industry and market conditions, underlying collateral, and other factors that may be relevant based on the facts and circumstances pertaining to individual securities. 

If the Company intends to sell the fixed maturity security or will be more likely than not be required to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then any allowance for credit losses, if previously recorded is written off and the fixed maturity security s amortized cost is written down to the security s fair value as of the reporting date with any incremental impairment recorded as a charge to noninterest income. 

Equity securities are comprised of mutual funds and common stocks and are carried at fair value. The associated unrealized gains and losses are included in net realized investment gains (losses). Dividends from these investments are recognized in net investment income when declared. 

Mortgage loans are carried at unpaid balances, net of unamortized premium or discounts. This measurement of mortgage loans on an amortized cost basis is reduced by an allowance for credit losses representing a valuation allowance that is deducted from the amortized costs basis of mortgage loans to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the mortgage loans. 

Interest income and the amortization of premiums or discounts are included in net investment income. Mortgage loan fees, certain direct loan origination costs, and purchase premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield by the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. In certain circumstances, prepayments may be anticipated. 

The statement of operations reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized mortgage loans as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported mortgage loan balances. The Company uses judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in establishing the valuation allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses for mortgage loans with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit determination since origination is determined and the initial allowance for credit losses should be added to the purchase price of mortgage loans rather than being reported as a credit loss expenses. 

The Company, however, has established and will continue to establish a valuation allowance for mortgage loans on real estate that are not supported by funds held in escrow based on historical patterns. The Company s foreclosed properties have not resulted in accumulated losses and due to the low loan-to-value the Company holds with respect to its mortgage loans, the Company has not recorded and does not expect to record the addition to the purchase price of mortgage loans an initial allowance for credit losses to be amortized over the life of the mortgage loans. The Company will continue to record credit losses for mortgage loans not supported by funds held in escrow in accordance with its valuation policy for mortgage loans on real estate followed before 2023. 

While the Company utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of this allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of the residential and commercial mortgage loan portfolio, the economy and changes in interest rates. The allowance for possible mortgage loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specific loans and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified loans. 

The Company considers mortgage loans on real estate impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the mortgage loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis. Factors that the Company considers in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value of the real estate subject to the mortgage loan and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Mortgage loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. 

The Company determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the mortgage loan on real estate and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 

Investment real estate in land held for both the production of income and for sale is carried at cost. Investment real estate obtained through foreclosure on mortgage loans on real estate is carried at the lower of acquisition cost or net realizable value. 

Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on policy loans is recognized in net investment income at the contract interest rate when earned. 

Other long-term investments are comprised of lottery prize receivables and are carried at amortized cost. Interest income and the accretion of discount are included in net investment income. These investments are backed by the lottery departments at the various states by U.S. Treasury Bonds and Notes or in the case of Pennsylvania, by annuities purchased from a highly rated life insurance company. Given this support to lottery prize receivables, the Company has not recorded and does not expect to incur any current estimated credit losses on its investments in lottery prize receivables. 

of cash dividends, stock dividends or amounts due upon any FTFC merger, sale or liquidation event. FTFC s Class B shareholders may also convert one share of FTFC s Class B common stock for a .85 share of FTFC s Class A common stock. FTFC s Class A shareholders will elect the remaining Board of Directors members and will receive of cash dividends, stock dividends or amounts due upon any Company merger, sale or liquidation event. 

Treasury stock, representing shares of the Company s common stock that have been reacquired after having been issued and fully paid, is recorded at the reacquisition cost and the shares are no longer outstanding. 

The updated guidance also amended the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and requires the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security s amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. The Company adopted this standard in first quarter 2023 on a modified retrospective basis. The cumulative effect adjustment to January 1, 2023 accumulated earnings for the adoption of this standard was a charge of . 

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

In March 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022-2) for the accounting of troubled debt restructuring and disclosures. The amendments introduced new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The amendments promulgated that an entity must apply specific loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or the continuation of an existing loan. The amendments also required that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. The Company adopted the amendments in this standard in first quarter 2023. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts 

In August 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2018-12) to the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. This update improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits, modifies the rate used to discount future cash flows, simplifies and improves accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (i.e., account balance) contracts, simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisitions costs and expands required disclosures. The expanded disclosure requires an insurance entity to provide disaggregated roll forwards of beginning to ending balances of the following: liability for future policy benefits, policyholder account balances, market risk benefits, separate account liabilities and deferred acquisition costs including disclosure about, changes to and effect of changes for significant inputs, judgments, assumptions and methods used in measurements. 

The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. As a Smaller Reporting Company, the effective date has been changed twice and the delayed effective date is now for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. With respect to the liability for future policyholder benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts and deferred acquisition costs, an insurance entity may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. With respect to the market risk benefits, an insurance entity should apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time.

In December 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022-5) to Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 (Targeted Improvements for Long-Duration Contracts) that originally required an insurance entity to apply a retrospective transition method as of the beginning of the earliest period presented or the beginning of the prior fiscal year if early application was elected. This updated guidance reduces implementation costs and complexity associated with the adoption of targeted improvements in accounting for long-duration contracts that have been derecognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 before the delayed effective date. Without the amendments in this Update, an insurance entity would be required to reclassify a portion of gains or losses previously recognized in the sale or disposal of insurance contracts or legal entities because of the adoption of a new accounting standard. Because there is no effect on an insurance entity s future cash flows, this reclassification may not be useful to users of financial information. 

The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time. 

Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 

In November 2023, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2023-07) to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses on both an annual and interim basis. The amendments require public entities to follow the significant expense principle and disclose on an annual and interim basis significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM with additional disclosure of the CODM s title, position and how the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss are used in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. In addition, amounts for other segment items are required to be disclosed including a description of its composition. If the COMD uses more than one measure in assessing segment performance and allocating resources, at least one of the measures should be consistent with the corresponding amounts utilized in the public entity s consolidated financial statements. 

The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company anticipates adopting and disclosing this Update for year-end reporting in 2024 and for interim periods beginning in 2025. 

Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 

In December 2023, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2023-09) to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis disclose information about taxes paid and a tabular reconciliation using both percentages and amounts of specific categories in the rate reconciliation. In addition, separate disclosure is required for any reconciling item equal to or greater than five (5) percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes by the statutory income tax rate. If not otherwise evident, a public business entity is required to provide an explanation of the individual reconciling items such as the nature, effect and causes of the reconciling items. 

The amendments in this guidance are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis but retrospective application is permitted. Early adoption is permitted. The Company anticipates adopting and disclosing this Update for year-end reporting in 2025. 

Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosures by Public Companies 

On July 26, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted this Final Rule (the Cybersecurity Final Rule enhancing disclosure requirements for registered companies covering cybersecurity risk and management. The Cybersecurity Final Rule requires registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K within four business days of a determination that a cybersecurity incident is material, and such materiality determination must be made without unreasonable delay. 

The rule also requires periodic disclosures of, among other things, details on the company s processes to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks, cybersecurity governance, and management s role in overseeing such a compliance program, including the board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risks. Certain reporting requirements under the Cybersecurity Final Rule became effective in December 2023. 

The Company has never had a material cyber security incident but will follow the Cybersecurity Final Rule regarding timely disclosure of a material cyber security incident. The Company has also disclosed its strategy and governance with respect to its cybersecurity risk management program in this September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Level 3 financial instruments consisted of a private placement common stock that has no active trading and a joint venture investment with a mortgage loan originator. 

This private placement common stock represents an investment in small insurance holding company. The fair value for this security was determined through the use of unobservable assumptions about market participants. The Company has assumed a willing market participant would purchase the security for the same price as the Company paid until such time as this small insurance holding company commence significant operations. The joint venture investment with a mortgage loan originator is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 

Fair values for Level 1 and Level 2 assets for the Company s fixed maturity available-for-sale and equity securities are primarily based on prices supplied by a third party investment service. The third party investment service provides quoted prices in the market which use observable inputs in developing such rates. 

The Company analyzes market valuations received to verify reasonableness and to understand the key assumptions used and the sources. Since the fixed maturity securities owned by the Company do not trade on a daily basis, the third party investment service prepares estimates of fair value measurements using relevant market data, benchmark curves, sector groupings and matrix pricing. As the fair value estimates of the Company s fixed maturity securities are based on observable market information rather than market quotes, the estimates of fair value on these fixed maturity securities are included in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The Company s Level 2 investments include obligations of U.S. government and U.S. government agencies, state and political subdivisions, U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, exchange traded securities, foreign bonds and redeemable preferred stocks. 

The Company s equity securities are included in Level 1 and Level 2 and the private placement common stock and joint venture investment are included in Level 3. Level 1 for equity securities classified as such is appropriate since they trade on a daily basis, are based on quoted market prices in active markets and are based upon unadjusted prices. Level 2 for those equity securities classified as such is appropriate since they are not actively traded. 

The Company s fixed maturity available-for-sale securities and equity securities are highly liquid and allows for a high percentage of the portfolio to be priced through pricing services. 

The change in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 equity securities available-for-sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is summarized as follows:

The estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment was required to interpret market data to develop these estimates. Accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts which could be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the fair value amounts. 

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value disclosures for financial instruments in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto: 

Fixed Maturity Securities and Equity Securities 

The fair value of fixed maturity securities and equity securities are based on the principles previously discussed as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. 

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 

The fair values for mortgage loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. For both residential and commercial mortgage loans, the discount rate used was indexed to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, Accrued Investment Income and Policy Loans 

The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair values. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy due to their highly liquid nature. 

Other Long-Term Investments 

Other long-term investments are comprised of lottery prize receivables and fair value is derived by using a discounted cash flow approach. Projected cash flows are discounted using the average FTSE Pension Liability Index in effect at the end of each period. 

Investment Contracts Policyholders Account Balances 

The fair value for liabilities under investment-type insurance contracts (accumulation annuities) is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash flows are projected using actuarial assumptions and discounted to the valuation date using risk-free rates adjusted for credit risk and the nonperformance risk of the liabilities. 

The fair values for insurance contracts other than investment-type contracts are not required to be disclosed. 

Policy Claims 

The carrying amounts reported for these liabilities approximate their fair value.

to the Company and to Mr. Zahn. In February 2020, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals, upon an appeal by Mr. Pettigrew, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. A Petition for Certiorari review with the Oklahoma Supreme Court by the Company and Mr. Zahn was declined in December, 2020. The case is now scheduled to be retried in the District Court once a trial date is set. The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case. The Company faces no exposure in connection with this action since there were no counterclaims or cross claims made against the Company. Management believes that this lawsuit is not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

The Company, through its life insurance subsidiary, TLIC, commenced two lawsuits as plaintiff, both in the New York Supreme Court, New York County, one on June 29, 2020 and another on March 4, 2022, for breach of contract against a company for failure to advance funding to lottery ticket winners to the detriment of TLIC and against various of that company s associated persons for unjust enrichment and fraud perpetuated on TLIC. The cases are entitled Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 652780/2020 (New York Supreme Court, New York County) and Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, Julie Casal, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 651023/2022 (New York Supreme Court, New York County). The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case against the defendants. The Company faces no exposure in connection with either action since no counterclaims or cross claims have been made against the Company. Management believes that these lawsuits are not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

Guaranty fund assessments, brought about by the insolvency of life and health insurers, are levied at the discretion of the various state guaranty fund associations to cover association obligations. In most states, guaranty fund assessments may be taken as a credit against premium taxes, typically over a five-year period.

Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

First Trinity Financial Corporation we us , our , FTFC or the Company conducts operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products and annuity contracts in niche markets. 

As an insurance provider, we collect premiums in the current period to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders. Our core TLIC and FBLIC operations include issuing modified premium whole life insurance with a flexible premium deferred annuity, ordinary whole life, final expense, term and annuity products to predominately middle income households in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia through independent agents. 

We also realize revenues from our investment portfolio, which is a key component of our operations. The revenues we collect as premiums from policyholders are invested to ensure future benefit payments under the policy contracts. Life insurance companies earn profits on the investment spread, which reflects the investment income earned on the premiums paid to the insurer between the time of receipt and the time benefits are paid out under policies. Changes in interest rates, changes in economic conditions and volatility in the capital markets can all impact the amount of earnings that we realize from our investment portfolio. 

Acquisitions 

The Company expects to facilitate growth through acquisitions of other life insurance companies and/or blocks of life insurance and annuity business. In late December 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 of the outstanding stock of FLAC for 2,500,000 and had additional acquisition related expenses of 195,234. 

In late December 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 of the outstanding stock of FBLIC for 13,855,129. 

On April 28, 2015, the Company acquired a block of life insurance policies and annuity contracts according to the terms of an assumption reinsurance agreement and assumed liabilities of 3,055,916. 

In 2019, FTFC s acquisition of TAI for 250,000 was approved by the Barbados, West Indies regulators. 

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company acquired 100 of the outstanding common stock of K-TENN Insurance Company K-TENN from its sole shareholder in exchange for 168,866 shares of FTFC s common stock. The aggregate purchase price of K-TENN was 1,746,240. 

On January 4, 2022, FTFC acquired RCLIC from Royalty in exchange for 722,644 shares of FTFC s Class A common stock issued to unrelated parties. Royalty was dissolved immediately after FTFC acquired RCLIC. On March 1, 2022, the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance approved FTFC s contribution and merger of RCLIC into FBLIC. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions continually, including those related to investments, deferred acquisition costs, allowance for loan losses from mortgages, value of insurance business acquired, policy liabilities, regulatory requirements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

The Company considers its most critical accounting estimates to be those applied to investments in fixed maturities securities, mortgage loans on real estate, deferred policy acquisition costs, value of insurance business acquired and future policy benefits. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023. 

Cybersecurity 

The Company has established and continues to enhance its cybersecurity enterprise risk management program. The Company s executive team meets formally at least monthly, and informally as needed, to set and maintain a strategy focused on achieving a high level of cybersecurity protection. The Company s executive management team makes quarterly reports to the Company s Board of Directors and Audit Committee. 

The Company s executive management team is enhanced by the inclusion of an information technology external consultant to advise the Company s executive management team and to focus on developing and maintaining external and internal cybersecurity. Working with Company executives and staff, the information technology consultant advises and helps the Company implement its strategy with respect to: 

Computer hardware and software, 

Security access, logging and user termination, 

In house and remote user access user accounts, password protection, authentication, monitoring usage, intrusion detection, incident identification and related controls, 

Encryption, 

System change control, 

Data back up and remote sites, 

Data recovery, 

and Disaster recovery 

The Company also utilizes training to foster an environment of information security awareness, training and education. Beyond making employees aware of its cybersecurity risk management program, strategy and governance, this training also introduces all employees to many types of cybersecurity risks to introduce skepticism and enhance skills to identify and report potential situations encountered to the executive management team for further assessment. 

Adopted Accounting Standards 

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 

In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2016-13) for the accounting for credit losses for financial instruments. The updated guidance applied a new credit loss model (current expected credit losses or CECL) for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g. reinsurance recoverables, including structured settlements that are recorded as part of reinsurance recoverables) and required an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures. 

The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The expected credit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, are recorded through an allowance account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount expected to be collected. 

38

The updated guidance also amended the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and requires the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security s amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. The Company adopted this standard in first quarter 2023 on a modified retrospective basis. The cumulative effect adjustment to January 1, 2023 accumulated earnings for the adoption of this standard was a charge of 230,036. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

In March 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022-2) for the accounting of troubled debt restructuring and disclosures. The amendments introduced new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The amendments promulgated that an entity must apply specific loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or the continuation of an existing loan. The amendments also required that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. The Company adopted the amendments in this standard in first quarter 2023. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts 

In August 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2018-12) to the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. This update improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits, modifies the rate used to discount future cash flows, simplifies and improves accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (i.e., account balance) contracts, simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisitions costs and expands required disclosures. The expanded disclosure requires an insurance entity to provide disaggregated roll forwards of beginning to ending balances of the following: liability for future policy benefits, policyholder account balances, market risk benefits, separate account liabilities and deferred acquisition costs including disclosure about, changes to and effect of changes for significant inputs, judgments, assumptions and methods used in measurements. 

The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. As a Smaller Reporting Company, the effective date has been changed twice and the delayed effective date is now for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. With respect to the liability for future policyholder benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts and deferred acquisition costs, an insurance entity may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. With respect to the market risk benefits, an insurance entity should apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time. 

Transition for Sold Contracts 

In December 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022-5) to Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 (Targeted Improvements for Long-Duration Contracts) that originally required an insurance entity to apply a retrospective transition method as of the beginning of the earliest period presented or the beginning of the prior fiscal year if early application was elected. This updated guidance reduces implementation costs and complexity associated with the adoption of targeted improvements in accounting for long-duration contracts that have been derecognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 before the delayed effective date. Without the amendments in this Update, an insurance entity would be required to reclassify a portion of gains or losses previously recognized in the sale or disposal of insurance contracts or legal entities because of the adoption of a new accounting standard. Because there is no effect on an insurance entity s future cash flows, this reclassification may not be useful to users of financial information. 

39

The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time. 

Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 

In November 2023, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2023-07) to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses on both an annual and interim basis. The amendments require public entities to follow the significant expense principle and disclose on an annual and interim basis significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM with additional disclosure of the CODM s title, position and how the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss are used in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. In addition, amounts for other segment items are required to be disclosed including a description of its composition. If the COMD uses more than one measure in assessing segment performance and allocating resources, at least one of the measures should be consistent with the corresponding amounts utilized in the public entity s consolidated financial statements. 

The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company anticipates adopting and disclosing this Update for year-end reporting in 2024 and for interim periods beginning in 2025. 

Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 

In December 2023, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2023-09) to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis disclose information about taxes paid and a tabular reconciliation using both percentages and amounts of specific categories in the rate reconciliation. In addition, separate disclosure is required for any reconciling item equal to or greater than five (5) percent of the amount computed by multiplying the income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes by the statutory income tax rate. If not otherwise evident, a public business entity is required to provide an explanation of the individual reconciling items such as the nature, effect and causes of the reconciling items. 

The amendments in this guidance are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis but retrospective application is permitted. Early adoption is permitted. The Company anticipates adopting and disclosing this Update for year-end reporting in 2025. 

Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosures by Public Companies 

On July 26, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted this Final Rule (the Cybersecurity Final Rule enhancing disclosure requirements for registered companies covering cybersecurity risk and management. The Cybersecurity Final Rule requires registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K within four business days of a determination that a cybersecurity incident is material, and such materiality determination must be made without unreasonable delay. 

The rule also requires periodic disclosures of, among other things, details on the company s processes to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity risks, cybersecurity governance, and management s role in overseeing such a compliance program, including the board of directors oversight of cybersecurity risks. Certain reporting requirements under the Cybersecurity Final Rule became effective in December 2023. 

The Company has never had a material cyber security incident but will follow the Cybersecurity Final Rule regarding timely disclosure of a material cyber security incident. The Company has also disclosed its strategy and governance with respect to its cybersecurity risk management program in this September 30, 2024 Form 10-Q.

The 820,496 increase in premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to a 391,698 increase in ordinary life renewal premiums, 288,503 increase in ordinary life first year premiums and 150,289 increase in final expense renewal premiums that exceeded a 9,994 decrease in final expense first year premiums. 

The increase in ordinary life renewal premiums and ordinary life first year premiums primarily reflects ordinary dollar denominated life insurance policies sold in the international market by TAI. The increase in final expense renewal premiums reflects the persistency of prior years final expense production. The decrease in final expense first year premiums reflects changes in competitor underwriting guidelines that are relaxed compared to our restricted underwriting standards.

The 184,297 decrease in gross investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to 794,354 decrease in mortgage loans and a 77,264 decrease in short-term and other investments that exceeded a 754,594 increase in fixed maturity securities. 

The decrease in mortgage loans is primarily due to decreased mortgage loans investments of 31.9 million since September 30, 2023. The decline in short-term and other investments is primarily due to a decreased gross yield of 4.49 in 2024 compared to 7.83 in 2023. The increase in fixed maturity securities investment income is primarily due to increased fixed maturity securities investments of 50.9 million since September 30, 2023. 

The 132,740 increase in investment expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to increased mortgage loan acquisition expenses.

108,272 increase in interest credited to policyholders is primarily due to an increased interest credit rate of 4.20 in 2024 compared to 3.80 in 2023. 

185,904 decrease in death benefits is primarily due to approximately 224,000 of decreased ordinary life benefits that exceeded 39,000 of increased final expense benefits. 

Deferral and Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs 

Certain costs related to the successful acquisition of traditional life insurance policies are capitalized and amortized over the premium-paying period of the policies. Certain costs related to the successful acquisition of insurance and annuity policies that subject us to mortality or morbidity risk over a period that extends beyond the period or periods in which premiums are collected and that have terms that are fixed and guaranteed (i.e., limited-payment long-duration annuity contracts) are capitalized and amortized in relation to the present value of actual and expected gross profits on the policies. 

46

These acquisition costs, which are referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs, include commissions and other successful costs of acquiring policies and contracts, which vary with, and are primarily related to, the successful production of new and renewal life insurance policies and annuity contracts. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, capitalized costs were 4,757,508 and 2,987,689, respectively. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2,767,806 and 2,189,089, respectively. 

The 1,769,819 increase in 2024 acquisition costs deferred is primarily related to increased annuity production with a corresponding increase in deferral of eligible annuity commissions. The 578,717 increase in 2024 amortization of deferred acquisition costs is due to 2024 life and annuity surrenders and withdrawal activity. 

Amortization of Value of Insurance Business Acquired 

The cost of acquiring insurance business is amortized over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions that were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits. Amortization of the value of insurance business acquired was 46,697 and 65,288 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a 18,591 decrease.

The 9,940,862 increase in future policy benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to the production of new life insurance policies and the aging of existing policies an additional year. 

The 43,570,983 decrease in funds withheld under coinsurance agreement is due to significant 2024 surrenders of coinsured annuity contracts under coinsurance agreement with an offshore annuity and life insurance company. 

The 1,688,148 increase in deferred federal income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to 978,744 of increased deferred federal income taxes on the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities and preferred stock available-for-sale and 709,404 of operating deferred federal tax expense.

The 13,065,641 increase in suspense accounts payable is due to increased deposits on policy applications that had not been issued as of the financial reporting date. 

The 320,477 increase in account payable is primarily amounts owed to a lottery vendor and a consultant. 

The 147,676 increase in other payables, withholdings and escrows is primarily due to a decrease in escrow advances. 

The decrease in mortgage loan suspense of 2,011,135 is primarily due to timing of principal loan payments on mortgage loans.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our operations have been financed primarily through the private placement of equity securities and intrastate public stock offerings. Through September 30, 2024, we have received 27,119,480 from the sale of our shares. 

The Company raised 1,450,000 from two private placements during 2004 and 25,669,480 from two public stock offerings and one private placement stock offering from June 22, 2005 through February 23, 2007; June 29, 2010 through April 30, 2012; and August 15, 2012 through March 8, 2013. The Company issued 7,347,488 shares of its common stock and incurred 3,624,518 of offering costs during these private placements and public stock offerings. 

The Company also issued 702,685 shares of its common stock in connection with two stock dividends paid to shareholders in 2011 and 2012 that resulted in accumulated earnings being charged 5,270,138 with an offsetting credit of 5,270,138 to common stock and additional paid-in capital. 

In 2020, the Company paid a 0.05 per share cash dividend for a total of 393,178 and issued 791,339 shares of class A common stock in connection with a 10 stock dividend to its Class A shareholders. The 10 stock dividend resulted in accumulated earnings being charged 8,657,249 with an offsetting credit of 8,657,249 to common stock and additional paid-in capital. 

The Company has also purchased 247,580 shares of treasury stock at a cost of 893,947 from former members of the Board of Directors including the former Chairman of the Board of Directors, a former agent, the former spouse of the Company s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President and a charitable organization where a former member of the Board of Directors had donated shares of the Company s common stock. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 65,104,323. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents of 35,844,116 and 22,693,515, respectively, totaling 58,537,631 were held by TLIC and FBLIC and may not be available for use by FTFC due to the required pre-approval by the Oklahoma Insurance Department of any dividend or intercompany transaction to transfer funds to FTFC. The maximum dividend, which may be paid in any twelve-month period without notification or approval, is limited to the greater of 10 of statutory surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or the net gain from operations of the preceding calendar year. 

Cash dividends may only be paid out of surplus derived from realized net profits. Based on these limitations, there is no capacity for TLIC to pay a dividend due to a negative unassigned surplus of 2,247,082 as of December 31, 2023. In addition, based on those limitations, there is the capacity for FBLIC to pay a dividend up to 1,373,511 in 2024 without prior approval. FBLIC has paid no dividends to TLIC in 2024 and 2023. TLIC has paid no dividends to FTFC in 2024 and 2023. 

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at multiple institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures interest and non-interest bearing accounts up to 250,000. Uninsured balances aggregate 53,602,786 and 26,017,084 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The increase in shareholders equity of 8,807,352 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due to 5,125,417 in net income and a 3,681,935 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

The liquidity requirements of our life insurance companies are met primarily by funds provided from operations. Premium and annuity consideration deposits, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds. There were no liquidity issues in 2024 or 2023. Our investments include marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs. 

We are subject to various market risks. The quality of our investment portfolio and the current level of shareholders equity continue to provide a sound financial base as we strive to expand our marketing to offer competitive products. Our investment portfolio had unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale securities of 7,530,511 and 12,207,282 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, prior to the impact of income taxes and deferred acquisition cost adjustments. A decrease of 4,628,316 in unrealized losses arising for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 has been decreased by 2024 net realized investment losses of 48,455 originating from the sale and call activity for fixed maturity securities available-for-sale resulting in net unrealized losses on investments of 4,676,771. 

A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals. We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals. Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy. We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds. 

One of our significant risks relates to the fluctuations in interest rates. Regarding interest rates, the value of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities investment portfolio will increase or decrease in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income earned on newly acquired available-for-sale fixed maturity securities increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes. 

From an income perspective, we are exposed to rising interest rates which could be a significant risk, as TLIC's and FBLIC s annuity business is impacted by changes in interest rates. Life insurance company policy liabilities bear fixed rates. From a liquidity perspective, our fixed rate policy liabilities are relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. 

We believe gradual increases in interest rates do not present a significant liquidity exposure for the life insurance policies and annuity contracts. We maintain conservative durations in our fixed maturity portfolio. 

63

As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, the fair value of fixed maturity available-for-sale securities with maturities of less than one year and the fair value of lottery receivables with maturities of less than one year equaled 15.9 of total policy liabilities. If interest rates rise significantly in a short time frame, there can be no assurance that the life insurance industry, including the Company, would not experience increased levels of surrenders and reduced sales, and thereby be materially adversely affected. 

In addition to the measures described above, TLIC and FBLIC must comply with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners promulgated Standard Valuation Law ("SVL") which specifies minimum reserve levels and prescribes methods for determining them, with the intent of enhancing solvency. Upon meeting certain tests, which TLIC and FBLIC met during 2023, the SVL also requires the Company to perform annual cash flow testing for TLIC and FBLIC. This testing is designed to ensure that statutory reserve levels will maintain adequate protection in a variety of potential interest rate scenarios. The Actuarial Standards Board of the American Academy of Actuaries also requires cash flow testing as a basis for the actuarial opinion on the adequacy of the reserves which is a required part of the annual statutory reporting process. 

Our marketing plan could be modified to emphasize certain product types and reduce others. New business levels could be varied in order to find the optimum level. We believe that our current liquidity, current bond portfolio maturity distribution and cash position give us substantial resources to administer our existing business and fund growth generated by direct sales. 

The operations of TLIC and FBLIC may require additional capital contributions to meet statutory capital and surplus requirements mandated by state insurance departments. Life insurance contract liabilities are generally long term in nature and are generally paid from future cash flows or existing assets and reserves. We will service other expenses and commitments by: (1) using available cash, (2) dividends from TLIC and FBLIC that are limited by law to the greater of prior year net operating income or 10 of prior year end surplus unless specifically approved by the controlling insurance department, (3) public and private offerings of our common stock and (4) corporate borrowings, if necessary. 

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a revised advance agreement with one loan originator. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has outstanding advances to this loan originator totaling 4,542,681. The advances are secured by 8,192,174 of residential mortgage loans on real estate that are assigned to the Company. The Company has committed to fund up to an additional 1,457,319 to the loan originator that would result in additional security in the form of residential mortgage loans on real estate to be assigned to the Company. 

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company also entered into a revised escrow agreement with the same loan originator. According to the revised terms of the escrow agreement, as of September 30, 2024, 1,127,400 of additional and secured residential mortgage loan balances on real estate are held in escrow by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, 1,111,014 of that escrow amount is available to the Company as additional collateral on 4,542,681 of advances to the loan originator. The remaining September 30, 2024 escrow amount of 16,386 is available to the Company as additional collateral on its investment of 3,277,276 in residential mortgage loans on real estate. 

We are not aware of any commitments or unusual events that could materially affect our capital resources. We are not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authority which, if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Certifying Officers ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended Exchange Act as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is made known to management, including our Certifying Officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, it believes that any ultimate liability arising from them will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flow. We are not currently a party to any bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, adjustment or similar proceeding, and we are not aware of any material threatened litigation. As summarized below, the Company is currently involved in three pending lawsuits. 

A lawsuit filed by the Company and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gregg E. Zahn Mr. Zahn styled First Trinity Financial Corporation and Gregg E. Zahn vs. C. Wayne Pettigrew and Group Pension Planners was originally filed in 2013 in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma against former Company Board of Director, C. Wayne Pettigrew Mr. Pettigrew ). The Company and Mr. Zahn alleged that Mr. Pettigrew defamed Mr. Zahn and the Company and that Mr. Pettigrew breached his fiduciary duties to the Company by making untrue statements about the Company and Mr. Zahn to the press, state regulators and to certain shareholders. 

In February 2017, the lawsuit resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the Company and Mr. Zahn, with the jury awarding damages of 800,000 to the Company and 3,500,000 to Mr. Zahn. In February 2020, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals, upon an appeal by Mr. Pettigrew, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. A Petition for Certiorari review with the Oklahoma Supreme Court by the Company and Mr. Zahn was declined in December, 2020. The case is now scheduled to be retried in the District Court once a trial date is set. The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case. The Company faces no exposure in connection with this action since there were no counterclaims or cross claims made against the Company. Management believes that this lawsuit is not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

The Company, through its life insurance subsidiary, TLIC, commenced two lawsuits as plaintiff, both in the New York Supreme Court, New York County, one on June 29, 2020 and another on March 4, 2022, for breach of contract against a company for failure to advance funding to lottery ticket winners to the detriment of TLIC and against various of that company s associated persons for unjust enrichment and fraud perpetuated on TLIC. The cases are entitled Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 652780/2020 (New York Supreme Court, New York County) and Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, Julie Casal, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 651023/2022 (New York Supreme Court, New York County). The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case against the defendants. The Company faces no exposure in connection with either action since no counterclaims or cross claims have been made against the Company. Management believes that these lawsuits are not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations.
