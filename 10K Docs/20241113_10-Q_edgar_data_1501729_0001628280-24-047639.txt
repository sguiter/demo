of the Company s total assets. 
 Prior to September 29, 2023, the Company s investment objectives were to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in privately-held U.S. companies in the energy and power industry. Prior to September 29, 2023, the Company s investment policy was to invest, under normal circumstances, at least of its total assets in securities of energy and power related, or Energy, companies. The Company considers Energy companies to be those companies that engage in the exploration, development, production, gathering, transportation, processing, storage, refining, distribution, mining, generation or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined products, coal or power, including those companies that provide equipment or services to companies engaged in any of the foregoing. 
 The Company commenced transitioning the Company s portfolio holdings away from Energy investments in May 2023, while remaining in compliance with the Company s then-current investment policy. The Company s allocation to Energy investments is expected to continue to decline over time through the natural course of maturities, repayments and sales activity and by growing the total size of the portfolio through leverage facilities. The pace of the portfolio rotation is dependent upon a number of factors, including the turnover of concentrated illiquid Energy investments, performance of underlying portfolio companies, high yield and energy market conditions, the Company s access to borrowings and the amount and pace of the payment of enhanced distributions to shareholders, among others. 
 The Company is managed by FS/EIG Advisor, LLC, or FS/EIG Advisor, pursuant to an investment advisory and administrative services agreement, dated as of April 9, 2018, or the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. FS/EIG Advisor oversees the management of the Company s operations and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to the Company s portfolio. FS/EIG Advisor is jointly operated by an affiliate of Franklin Square Holdings, L.P. (which does business as FS Investments) and EIG Asset Management, LLC, or EIG.

 of the Company s incentive fee capital gains, which are the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees on capital gains. The Company will accrue for the incentive fee on capital gains, which, if earned, will be paid annually. The Company will accrue the incentive fee on capital gains based on net realized and unrealized gains; however, the fee payable to FS/EIG Advisor will be based on realized gains and no such fee will be payable with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not accrue any amount of capital gains incentive fee. 
 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, equal to per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of . As a result, FS/EIG Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of . For purposes of this fee, adjusted capital means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company s common shares (including proceeds from its distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for distributions from non-liquidating dispositions of the Company s investments paid to shareholders and amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program. Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FS/EIG Advisor will be entitled to a catch-up fee equal to the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals , or annually, of adjusted capital. This catch-up feature will allow FS/EIG Advisor to recoup the fees foregone as a result of the existence of the hurdle rate. Thereafter, FS/EIG Advisor will be entitled to receive of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not accrue any amount of subordinated incentive fee on income. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized structuring or other upfront fee

 ______________ 
 (1) On September 15, 2023, the Company's second amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan terminated. 
 On July 19, 2023, the Company s board of trustees, including the independent trustees, approved the termination of the Company s second amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan with respect to distributions declared by the Company s board of trustees on the Company s common shares, effective as of September 15, 2023. After this date, all shareholders will receive any subsequent distributions in cash. 
 On February 25, 2020, the Company received exemptive relief from the SEC permitting it to offer multiple classes of common shares. While the Company has no present intention to recommence a public offering of its common shares, the Company could do so in the future.

 period ending on the date the applicable repurchase offer expires (less the amount of proceeds used to repurchase common shares on each previous repurchase date for repurchase offers conducted during such period) (this limitation is referred to as the repurchase limitation) and (B) the number of common shares that the Company can repurchase with the proceeds the Company receives from the sale of common shares under its distribution reinvestment plan during the period ending on the date the applicable repurchase offer expires (this limitation is referred to as the repurchase limitation). In addition to this limitation, the maximum number of common shares to be repurchased for any repurchase offer has also been limited to of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, or in each calendar quarter. As a result, the maximum number of common shares to be repurchased for any repurchase offer would not exceed the lesser of (i) of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, or in each calendar quarter, and (ii) whichever is greater of the repurchase limitation described in clause (A) above and the repurchase limitation described in clause (B) above. 
 Historically, pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program, the Company offered to repurchase common shares at a price equal to the price at which common shares were issued pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan on the distribution date coinciding with the applicable share repurchase date. The price at which common shares were issued under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan was determined by the Company s board of trustees or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, and was (i) not less than the net asset value per common share as determined in good faith by the Company s board of trustees or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, immediately prior to the payment date of the distribution and (ii) not more than greater than the net asset value per common share as of such date. The Company s board of trustees may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, upon days notice. The Company did repurchase any shares pursuant to its share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company's distribution reinvestment plan was terminated effective September 15, 2023. 
 In order to minimize the expense of supporting small accounts and provide additional liquidity to shareholders of the Company holding small accounts after completion of a regular quarterly share repurchase offer, the Company reserves the right to repurchase the shares of and liquidate any investor s account if the balance of such account is less than the Company s minimum initial investment, unless the account balance has fallen below the minimum solely as a result of a decline in the Company s net asset value per share. The Company will provide or will cause to be provided days prior written notice to potentially affected investors, which notice may be included in regular quarterly repurchase offer materials, of any such repurchase. Historically, any such repurchases were made at the Company s most recent price at which the Company s shares were issued pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan. There were no de minimis account liquidations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 of the average weekly value of the Company s gross assets. See Note 2 for a discussion of the capital gains and subordinated income incentive fees that FS/EIG Advisor may be entitled to under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. 
 FS/EIG Advisor may receive structuring or other upfront fees from portfolio companies in which FS/EIG Advisor has caused the Company to invest. FS/EIG Advisor has agreed to offset the amount of any structuring, upfront or certain other fees received by FS/EIG Advisor or its members against the management fees payable by the Company under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. FS/EIG Advisor may agree to discontinue offsetting such fees in the future. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of structuring, upfront or certain other fees received by FS/EIG Advisor or its members were offset against management fees. 
 Pursuant to the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, FS/EIG Advisor oversees the Company s day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities and other administrative services. FS/EIG Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Company s corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports for the Company s shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. 
 The Company reimburses FS/EIG Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company s administration and operations, including FS/EIG Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and/or related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and EIG providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of FS/EIG Advisor, and for transactional expenses for prospective investments, such as fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of investments that do not close, often referred to as broken deal costs. The Company reimburses FS/EIG Advisor no less than quarterly for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company s administration and operations. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FS/EIG Advisor s actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimates it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS/EIG Advisor allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as time allocations and other reasonable metrics. The Company s board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to the Company and assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to the Company based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining similar services from third-party providers known to be available. In addition, the Company s board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, the Company s board of trustees, among other things, compares the total amount paid to FS/EIG Advisor for such services as a percentage of the Company s net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. The Company does not reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS/EIG Advisor.

The Company paid and in administrative services expenses to FS/EIG Advisor, or its affiliates, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Potential Conflicts of Interest 
 The members of the senior management and investment teams of FS/EIG Advisor serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as the Company does, or of investment vehicles managed by the same personnel. The officers, managers and other personnel of FS/EIG Advisor may serve in similar or other capacities for the investment advisers to future investment vehicles affiliated with FS Investments or EIG. In serving in these multiple and other capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the Company s best interests or in the best interest of the Company s shareholders. The Company s investment objectives may overlap with the investment objectives of such investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles. In addition, members of the senior management and investment teams and other employees of FS/EIG Advisor or its members or their respective affiliates may from time to time invest in portfolio companies in which the Company also invests. For additional information regarding potential conflicts of interest, see the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Exemptive Relief 
 As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. In an order dated June 4, 2013, or the Order, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of its former investment adviser, including FS KKR Capital Corp., or collectively the Company s co-investment affiliates. Effective April 9, 2018, or the JV Effective Date, and in connection with the transition of advisory services to a joint advisory relationship with EIG, the Company s board of trustees authorized and directed that the Company (i) withdraw from the Order, except with respect to any transaction in which the Company participated in reliance on the Order prior to the JV Effective Date, and (ii) rely on an exemptive relief order dated April 10, 2018, granted to EIG and its affiliates which permits the Company to participate in co-investment transactions with certain other EIG advised funds, or the EIG Order. On September 19, 2023, the Company, FS/EIG Advisor and certain of their affiliates (the "FS Funds"), filed an application for exemptive relief with the SEC, and subsequently amended such application, to permit the FS Funds, including future affiliated investment funds, to co-invest in the same investment opportunities (the "FS Application"). On October 21, 2024, the SEC issued a notice for the FS Application. If the SEC issues an order in response to the FS Application, the Company will withdraw from the EIG Order, except with respect to any transaction in which the Company participated in reliance on the EIG Order prior to the issuance of the new order.

 (1) For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the distribution amount per share was , comprised of an initial distribution per share of declared in December 2023 and the remaining distribution per share of declared in January 2024, collectively representing an annualized distribution rate to shareholders of . 
 Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company's board of trustees, the Company expects to provide enhanced quarterly distributions to shareholders until the achievement of a long-term liquidity event. On October 18, 2024, the Company's board of trustees declared an enhanced cash distribution of per share for the third quarter of 2024, representing an annualized distribution rate to shareholders of based on the estimated net asset value of per share as of September 30, 2024. The enhanced distributions are expected to be paid quarterly and increase in subsequent years until the achievement of a long-term liquidity event, subject to a maximum cap of of the Company s then-current estimated net asset value beyond 2026. The Company expects a portion of the distributions may represent a return of investor capital, helping to accelerate liquidity for shareholders in the near-term. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pay distributions in the future. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of the Company s board of trustees. 
 Historically, the Company had an opt in distribution reinvestment plan for its shareholders. As a result, if the Company made a cash distribution, its shareholders would receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opted in to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional common shares. However, certain state authorities or regulators may have imposed restrictions from time to time that may have prevented or limited a shareholder's ability to participate in the distribution reinvestment plan. The Company's distribution reinvestment plan was terminated effective as of September 15, 2023. 
 Under the prior distribution reinvestment plan, cash distributions to participating shareholders would be reinvested in additional common shares at a purchase price determined by the Company s board of trustees, or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, that was (i) not less than the net asset value per common share as determined in good faith by the Company s board of trustees or a committee thereof, in its sole discretion, immediately prior to the payment of the distribution and (ii) not more than greater than the net asset value per common share as of such date. Any distributions reinvested under the plan would remain taxable to a U.S. shareholder. 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds legally available to it, including proceeds from the sale of the Company s common shares, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets and non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. The Company's distribution proceeds have exceeded and in the future

 The Company s board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the valuation of the Company s portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to FS/EIG Advisor s valuation policy. The Company s board of trustees has designated FS/EIG Advisor with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in FS/EIG Advisor s valuation policy. 
 The Company s investments consist primarily of investments that were acquired directly from the issuer. Debt investments, for which broker quotes or pricing information from third-party pricing services are not generally available, are valued by FS/EIG Advisor with the assistance of independent valuation firms, which determine a valuation range of fair value for such investments by considering, among other factors, the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, prevailing interest rates for like investments, call features, anticipated prepayments and other relevant terms of the investments. Except as described below, all of the Company s equity/other investments are valued by independent valuation firms, which determine the fair value of such investments by considering, among other factors, contractual rights ascribed to such investments, as well as various income scenarios and multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or, in limited instances, book value, PV-10 multiples or liquidation value. The Company s investment in SIIJV was previously valued by an independent valuation firm. FS/EIG Advisor has fair valued SIIJV. An investment that is newly issued and purchased near the date of the financial statements is valued at cost if FS/EIG Advisor determines that the cost of such investment is the best indication of its fair value. Such investments described above are typically classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Investments that are traded on an active public market are valued at their closing price as of the date of the financial statements and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Except as described above, FS/EIG Advisor typically values the Company s other investments by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which are provided by an independent third-party pricing service and screened for validity by such service and are typically classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. In determining the fair values of fixed price swaps, FS/EIG Advisor utilizes an industry-standard pricing model that considers various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments. The fair value of the equity total return swap is determined daily based on the market price of the underlying asset. The fair value of the loan total return swaps is determined daily based on the bid price of the underlying asset provided by the counterparty. These assumptions are observable in the marketplace or can be corroborated by active markets or broker quotes and are typically classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 FS/EIG Advisor periodically benchmarks the bid and ask prices it receives from the third-party pricing service and/or dealers and independent valuation firms, as applicable, against the actual prices at which the Company purchases and sells its investments. Based on the results of the benchmark analysis and the experience of the Company s management in purchasing and selling these investments, FS/EIG Advisor believes that these prices are reliable indicators of fair value. FS/EIG Advisor reviewed the valuation determinations made with respect to these investments in a manner consistent with FS/EIG Advisor s valuation policy.

 Overview 
 We were formed as a Delaware statutory trust under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act on September 16, 2010 and formally commenced investment operations on July 18, 2011. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In November 2016, we closed our continuous public offering of common shares to new investors. 
 Our investment activities are managed by FS/EIG Advisor and supervised by our board of trustees, a majority of whom are independent. Under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, we have agreed to pay FS/EIG Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. 
 In May 2023, we announced that our board of trustees approved our transition from an investment policy of investing primarily in Energy companies to a diversified credit investment policy of investing across private and public credit in a broader set of industries, sectors and sub-sectors. We commenced transitioning our portfolio holdings away from Energy investments in May 2023, while remaining in compliance with our then-current investment policy. Following a shareholder notice period, the new policy became effective on September 29, 2023. Our allocation to Energy investments is expected to continue to decline over time through the natural course of maturities, repayments and sales activity and by growing the total size of the portfolio through leverage facilities. The pace of the portfolio rotation is dependent upon a number of factors, including the turnover of concentrated illiquid Energy investments, performance of underlying portfolio companies, high yield and energy market conditions, our access to borrowings and the amount and pace of the payment of enhanced distributions to shareholders, among others. 
 Our current investment policy is to invest primarily in a portfolio of secured and unsecured floating and fixed rate loans, bonds and other types of credit instruments, which, under normal circumstances, will represent at least 80 of our total assets. This investment policy may not be changed without at least 60 days prior notice to holders of our common shares of any such change. 
 Our current investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We intend to pursue our investment objectives by investing in both direct originations and broadly syndicated investments of secured and unsecured floating and fixed rate loans, bonds and other types of credit instruments. Investing in both direct originations and broadly syndicated investments allows us to be dynamic in our pursuit of opportunities across changing economic and credit cycles. We intend to focus on the following investment categories in an effort to generate returns for our investors with an acceptable level of risk. 
 Direct Originations : Direct lending and innovative capital structure solutions to both sponsored and non-sponsored companies, typically based in the U.S. and operating within the middle market. These investments may include both debt and equity components. 
 Broadly Syndicated Loan and Bond Transactions : Opportunistic investments into primary and secondary markets, broadly syndicated loans and bonds. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In the case of broadly syndicated investments, we generally intend to capitalize on market inefficiencies by investing in loans, bonds, and other asset classes where the market price of such investment reflects a lower value than we believe is warranted based on our fundamental analysis, providing us with an opportunity to earn an attractive return on our investment. 
 However, we may pursue other investment opportunities if we believe they are in our best interests and consistent with our investment objectives. 
 Prior to September 29, 2023, our investment policy was to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80 of our total assets in securities of Energy companies and our investment objectives were to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We pursued our previous investment objectives by focusing on the following seven investment themes: (i) basin-on-basin competition in U.S. shale, (ii) globalization of natural gas, (iii) coal retirements and the evolving energy generation mix, (iv) renewables focused on power grid parity, (v) export infrastructure for emerging U.S. producers, (vi) market liberalization opening new markets and (vii)

 midstream infrastructure connecting new supplies. However, we could pursue other investment opportunities if we believed they were in our best interests and consistent with our then-current investment objectives. 
 The majority of our portfolio is comprised of income-oriented securities, which principally refers to debt securities and other income-producing investments, of privately-held companies within the United States. Historically, our portfolio has largely been invested in Energy companies, although we expect our portfolio to continue to shift away from investments in Energy companies as we pursue a diversified credit strategy. Generally, in the long-term we expect to weight our investments more heavily towards directly originated investments, as this will provide us with the ability to tailor investments to best match a project s or company s needs with our investment objectives. However, our current investment policy enables FS/EIG Advisor to opportunistically invest in broadly syndicated investments and dynamically adjust allocations between private and public markets depending on where the risk-adjusted returns are most attractive. We intend to weight our portfolio towards senior secured debt, which we believe offers opportunities for superior risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Our debt investments may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. These yield enhancements are typically expected to include warrants, options, net profits interests, cash flow participations or other forms of equity participation that can provide additional consideration or upside in a transaction. Our current preferred equity investments are generally directly originated and may take the form of perpetual or redeemable securities, typically with a current income component and minimum base returns. In addition, certain income-oriented preferred or common equity interests may include interests in master limited partnerships, or MLPs. MLPs are entities that (i) are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies, (ii) are publicly traded, (iii) satisfy certain requirements to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (iv) primarily own and operate midstream and upstream Energy companies. A portion of our portfolio may be comprised of derivatives, including the use of total return swaps, credit default swaps and other swap contracts. In connection with certain of our debt investments or any restructuring of these debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests, including warrants or options, as additional consideration or otherwise in connection with a restructuring. FS/EIG Advisor will seek to tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. 
 Our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be impacted by the transition to a new investment policy. 
 Revenues 
 The principal measure of our financial performance is net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, foreign currency and swap contracts, net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments, net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on swap contracts. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to non-investment related foreign currency fluctuations. Net realized gain or loss on swap contracts is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net change in unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on swap contracts is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of the difference between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price. 
 We principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. We also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we may hold. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate FS/EIG Advisor for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. 
 FS/EIG Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. FS/EIG Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, FS/EIG Advisor assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.

 We reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including FS/EIG Advisor s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and EIG providing administrative services to us on behalf of FS/EIG Advisor, and for transactional expenses for prospective investments, such as fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of investments that do not close, often referred to as "broken deal" costs. We reimburse FS/EIG Advisor no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing its obligations and providing personnel under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FS/EIG Advisor s actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that we estimate would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS/EIG Advisor allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as time allocations and other reasonable metrics. Our board of trustees reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of trustees considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of trustees compares the total amount paid to FS/EIG Advisor for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. We do not reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS/EIG Advisor. 
 We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to all other expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by FS/EIG Advisor in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by FS/EIG Advisor, to the extent they are not controlling persons of FS/EIG Advisor or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement. 
 In addition, we have contracted with State Street to provide various accounting and administrative services, including, but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by FS/EIG Advisor, preparing and monitoring expense budgets, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing with respect to RIC compliance. 
 For information regarding the fee offset with FS/EIG Advisor, see Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 Expected Distributions 
 Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees, we expect to provide enhanced quarterly distributions to shareholders until the achievement of a long-term liquidity event. The enhanced distributions declared for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023 each represented an annualized distribution rate of approximately 7.5 and the enhanced distribution rate for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 represented an annualized distribution rate of approximately 10.0 , in each case based on the then-current estimated net asset value. We expect to provide enhanced quarterly distributions to shareholders representing an annualized distribution rate of approximately 10.0 , 12.5 and 15.0 based on estimated net asset value as of such quarter end for 2024, 2025, and 2026 and beyond, respectively, provided we have not achieved a long-term liquidity event. We expect a portion of these distributions may represent a return of investor capital, helping to accelerate liquidity for shareholders in the near-term. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees.

 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenues 
 Our investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Interest income 42,546 81 27,180 89 149,750 87 84,371 73 Paid-in-kind interest income 3,034 5 2,343 8 8,681 5 14,174 12 Fee income 1,977 4 586 2 3,622 2 1,712 2 Dividend income 5,181 10 334 1 10,221 6 14,757 13 Total investment income (1)

 _____________________________ 
 (1) Such revenues represent 47,397 and 26,728 of cash income earned as well as 5,341 and 3,715 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and represent 156,366 and 96,356 of cash income earned as well as 15,908 and 18,658 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized. 
 The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We may experience volatility in the amount of interest income that we earn as the accrual status of existing portfolio investments may fluctuate due to restructuring activity in the portfolio. 
 The increase in the amount of interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to interest received on certain preferred equity positions. The decrease in the amount of PIK income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to certain investments being placed on non-accrual and the divestiture of certain investments earning PIK income. 
 Fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of prepayment fees and structuring fees. As such, future fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. The increase in the amount of fee income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in delayed compensation and miscellaneous fees during the period. 
 The decrease in the amount of dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in dividends paid with respect to our investments in certain common equities.

 Interest expense may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on changes in benchmark interest rates such as SOFR, leverage utilization rates and the terms of our financing arrangements, among other factors. 
 Management Fee Offset 
 Structuring, upfront or certain other fees received by FS/EIG Advisor or its members which were offset against management fees due to FS/EIG Advisor from us were 3 and 63 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6 and 337 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the management fee offset for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. FS/EIG Advisor may agree to discontinue offsetting such fees in the future.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 235,083 in cash and cash equivalents, which we held in custodial accounts and a money market fund, and 100,000 in borrowings available under our financing arrangement. As of September 30, 2024, we also had broadly syndicated investments that could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we had thirteen senior secured loan investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of 38,263 and unfunded commitments of 18,989 in U.S. dollars and 858 in Canadian dollars to contribute capital to Sustainable Infrastructure Investments, LLC. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and/or liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments and other contractual commitments should the need arise. 
 We generate cash primarily from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we may also seek to employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of FS/EIG Advisor, but unless and until we elect otherwise, as permitted by the 1940 Act, in no event will leverage employed exceed 50 of the value of our assets, as required by the 1940 Act. 
 Prior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the net proceeds from sales and paydowns of existing investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.

 RIC Tax Treatment and Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute as dividends to our shareholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each tax year, dividends generally of an amount at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a tax year after the close of such tax year under the spillover dividend provisions of Subchapter M of the Code. If we distribute a spillover dividend, such dividend will be included in a shareholder s gross income for the tax year in which the spillover distribution is paid. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our shareholders to maintain our RIC tax treatment each tax year. We will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner to our shareholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary taxable income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains over capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) 100 of any ordinary income and capital gain net income recognized for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to our shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our U.S. shareholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. 
 In general, when we pay regular cash distributions, we intend to declare them on a quarterly or monthly basis and pay them on a monthly basis. We will calculate each shareholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each shareholder s distributions will begin to accrue on the date that common shares are issued to such shareholder. From time to time, we may also pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees. 
 Our distribution proceeds have exceeded and in the future may exceed our earnings. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we have made represented, and may make in the future may represent, a return of capital to shareholders, which lowers their tax basis in their common shares. A return of capital generally is a return of an investor s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities and will be made after deducting the fees and expenses payable in connection with our continuous public offering, including any fees payable to FS/EIG Advisor. Moreover, a return of capital will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholder s cost basis in our common shares, and will result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when the common shares on which such return of capital was received are sold. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders. 
 We intend to make any regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution. Prior to September 15, 2023, shareholders could elect to receive their cash distributions in additional common shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. Any distributions reinvested under the plan nevertheless remained taxable to a U.S. shareholder. Our distribution reinvestment plan was terminated effective as of September 15, 2023. 
 Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees, we expect to provide enhanced 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 quarterly distributions to shareholders until the achievement of a long-term liquidity event. We expect to provide enhanced quarterly distributions to shareholders representing an annualized distribution rate of approximately 10.0 , 12.5 and 15.0 based on estimated net asset value as of such quarter end for 2024, 2025, and 2026 and beyond, respectively, provided we have not achieved a long-term liquidity event. We expect a portion of these distributions may represent a return of investor capital, helping to accelerate liquidity for shareholders in the near-term. Our board of trustees has and will continue to evaluate our ability to pay any distributions in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay distributions in the future. The timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders are subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of trustees. 
 The following table reflects the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 See Note 5 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our distributions. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 Our board of trustees is responsible for overseeing the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to FS/EIG Advisor s valuation policy. As permitted by Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, our board of trustees has designated FS/EIG Advisor as our valuation designee, with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in FS/EIG Advisor s valuation policy. 
 Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
 FS/EIG Advisor determines the fair value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities that are publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by FS/EIG Advisor. In connection with that determination, FS/EIG Advisor will prepare portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party pricing and valuation services. 
 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, a multi-step valuation process is undertaken each quarter, as described below: 
 our quarterly fair valuation process begins with FS/EIG Advisor facilitating the delivery of updated quarterly financial and other information relating to each investment to an independent third-party pricing or valuation service; 
 the independent third-party pricing or valuation service then reviews and analyzes the information, along with relevant market and economic data, and determines proposed valuations for each portfolio company or investment according to the valuation methodologies in FS/EIG Advisor s valuation policy and communicates the information to FS/EIG Advisor in the form of a valuation range for Level 3 assets; 
 FS/EIG Advisor then reviews the preliminary valuation information for each portfolio company or investment and provides feedback about the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the valuation-related inputs considered by the independent third-party pricing or valuation service and any suggested revisions thereto prior to the independent third-party pricing or valuation service finalizing its valuation range; 
 FS/EIG Advisor then provides the valuation committee with its valuation determinations and valuation-related information for each portfolio company or investment, along with any applicable supporting materials; and other information that is relevant to the fair valuation process as required by FS/EIG Advisor s board reporting obligations; 
 the valuation committee meets with FS/EIG Advisor to receive the relevant quarterly reporting from FS/EIG Advisor and to discuss any questions from the valuation committee in connection with the valuation committee s role in overseeing the fair valuation process; and 
 following the completion of its fair value oversight activities, the valuation committee (with the assistance of FS/EIG Advisor) provides our board of trustees with a report regarding the quarterly valuation process. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, FS/EIG Advisor may use any independent third-party pricing or valuation services for which it has performed the appropriate level of due diligence. However, FS/EIG Advisor is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information sourced by FS/EIG Advisor or provided by any independent third-party pricing or valuation service that FS/EIG Advisor deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that FS/EIG Advisor and any independent third-party valuation services may consider when determining the fair value of our investments. 
 The valuation methods utilized for each portfolio company may vary depending on industry and company-specific considerations. FS/EIG Advisor has fair valued SIIJV. Typically, the first step is to make an assessment as to the enterprise value of the portfolio company s business in order to establish whether the portfolio company s enterprise value is greater than the amount of its debt as of the valuation date. This analysis helps to determine a risk profile for the applicable portfolio company and its related investments, and the appropriate valuation methodology to utilize as part of the security valuation analysis. The enterprise valuation may be determined using a market or income approach. 
 Valuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, FS/EIG Advisor may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Various methods may be used to determine the appropriate discount rate in a discounted cash flow model. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower's ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing the debt investments. 
 For convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used. 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 Valuation of CLO subordinated notes considers a variety of relevant factors, including recent purchases and sales known to FS/EIG Advisor in similar securities and output from a third-party financial model. The third-party financial model contains detailed information on the characteristics of CLOs, including recent information about assets and liabilities, and is used to project future cash flows. Key inputs to the model include assumptions for future loan default rates, recovery rates, prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and discount rates. These are determined by considering both observable and third-party market data and prevailing general market assumptions and conventions. 
 Our equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. 
 When we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. FS/EIG Advisor subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value. 
 Swap contracts typically are valued at their daily prices obtained from an independent third party. The aggregate settlement values and notional amounts of the swap contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Fluctuations in the value of the swap contracts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as gross assets and gross liabilities and in the statements of operations as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until closed, when they will be recorded as net realized gain (loss). 
 See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into an agreement with FS/EIG Advisor to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the FS/EIG investment advisory agreement are equal to 1.75 of the average weekly value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance. Base management fees are generally paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. FS/EIG Advisor is reimbursed for administrative services expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of this agreement and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under this agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 75.4 of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) paid variable interest rates, 11.1 paid fixed interest rates, 10.4 were income producing equity/other investments and the remaining 3.1 consisted of non-income producing equity/other investments. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and the amount of incentive fees payable to FS/EIG Advisor with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Barclays Facility, we borrow at a floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or our subsidiaries have such debt outstanding or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. 
 The following table shows the effect over a twelve-month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income, assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangement in effect as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts are presented in thousands): 
 Basis Point Change in Interest Rates 
 Increase (Decrease) in 
 Interest Income (1) 
 Increase (Decrease) in 
 Interest Expense (2) 
 Increase (Decrease) in 
 Net Interest Income 
 Percentage Change in Net Interest Income 
 Down 100 basis points (12,737) (4,000) (8,737) (7.0) No change Up 100 basis points 12,716 4,000 8,716 7.0 Up 300 basis points 38,170 12,000 26,170 21.0 Up 500 basis points 63,623 20,000 43,623 35.0

 (1) Assumes no defaults or prepayments by portfolio companies over the next twelve months. 
 (2) Assumes current debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and no changes over the next twelve months. 
 We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 
 In addition, we may have risks regarding portfolio valuation and the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Valuation of Portfolio Investments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
