The 2017 TPA will expire on October 4, 2027. On July 19, 2021, we entered into an additional tax protection agreement (the 2021 TPA with certain of our executive officers, including Mr. Edison. The 2021 TPA carries a term of and will become effective upon the expiration of the 2017 TPA. As of September 30, 2024, the potential make-whole amount on the estimated aggregate amount of built-in gain subject to protection under the agreements is approximately million. The protection provided under the terms of the 2021 TPA will expire in 2031. We have not recorded any liability related to the 2017 TPA or the 2021 TPA on our consolidated balance sheets for any periods presented, nor recognized any expense since the inception of the 2017 TPA, owing to the fact that any potential liability under the agreements is controlled by us and we believe we will either (i) continue to own and operate the protected properties or (ii) be able to successfully complete tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (unless there is a change in applicable law) or complete other tax-efficient transactions to avoid any liability under the agreements. 
 Other Related Party Matters As of September 30, 2024, we were the limited guarantor of a million mortgage loan secured by GRP I properties. Our guaranty for the GRP I debt is limited to being the non-recourse carveout guarantor and the environmental indemnitor. Further, we are also party to an agreement with GRP I in which any potential liability under such guaranty will be apportioned between us and GRP I based on our respective ownership percentages in the joint venture. We have no liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheets for the guaranty as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were also the limited guarantor of a million mortgage loan secured by the NRV property. Our guaranty for the NRV debt is limited to being the non-recourse carveout guarantor and the environmental indemnitor. Further, we are also party to an agreement with NRV in which any potential liability under such guaranty will be apportioned between us and NRV based on our respective ownership percentages in the joint venture. We have no liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheets for the guaranty as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 (1) We record marketable securities and derivative assets in Other Assets, Net on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 (2) The fair values of the derivative assets exclude associated accrued interest receivable of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Marketable Securities We estimate the fair value of marketable securities using Level 1 inputs. We utilize unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets that we have the ability to access. 
 Derivative Instruments As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had interest rate swaps that fixed SOFR on portions of our unsecured term loan facilities. 
 All interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. 
 To comply with the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 
 Although we determined that the significant inputs used to value our derivatives fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our counterparties and our own credit risk utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

impairment charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 On a quarterly basis, we employ a multi-step approach to assess our real estate assets for possible impairment and record any impairment charges identified. The first step is the identification of potential triggering events, such as significant decreases in occupancy or the presence of large dark or vacant spaces. If we observe any of these indicators for a shopping center, we then perform an additional screen test consisting of a years-to-recover analysis to determine if we will recover the net book value of the property over its remaining economic life based upon net operating income NOI as forecasted for the current year. In the event that the results of this first step indicate a triggering event for a center, we proceed to the second step, utilizing an undiscounted cash flow model for the center to identify potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the center as of the balance sheet date, we record an impairment charge based on the fair value determined in the third step. In performing the third step, we utilize market data such as capitalization rates and sales price per square foot on comparable recent real estate transactions to estimate the fair value of the real estate assets. We also utilize expected net sales proceeds to estimate the fair value of any centers that are actively being marketed for sale. 
 In addition to these procedures, we also review undeveloped or unimproved land parcels that we own for evidence of impairment and record any impairment charges as necessary. Primary impairment triggers for these land parcels are changes to our plans or intentions with regards to such properties, or planned dispositions at prices that are less than the current carrying values.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND DEFINED TERMS 
 
 We use certain key performance indicators KPIs ), which include both financial and nonfinancial metrics, to measure the performance of our operations. We believe these KPIs, as well as the core concepts and terms defined below, allow our Board, management, and investors to analyze trends around our business strategy, financial condition, and results of operations in a manner that is focused on items unique to the retail real estate industry. 
 We do not consider our non-GAAP measures to be alternatives to measures required in accordance with GAAP. Certain non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance as they may not reflect the operations of our entire portfolio, and they may not reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income (expense), or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our shopping centers that could materially impact our results from operations. Additionally, certain non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an indication of our liquidity, nor as an indication of funds available to cover our cash needs, including our ability to fund distributions, and may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate our business in the manner currently contemplated. Accordingly, non-GAAP measures should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements and should not be viewed as more prominent measures of performance than net income (loss) or cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating similar non-GAAP measures, and accordingly, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other REITs.

Our KPIs and terminology can be grouped into three key areas: 
 PORTFOLIO Portfolio metrics help management to gauge the health of our centers overall and individually. 
 Anchor space We define an anchor space as a space greater than or equal to 10,000 square feet of gross leasable area GLA ). 
 ABR We use ABR to refer to the monthly contractual base rent at the end of the period multiplied by twelve months. 
 ABR Per Square Foot PSF This metric is calculated by dividing ABR by leased GLA. Increases in ABR PSF can be an indication of our ability to create rental rate growth in our centers, as well as an indication of demand for our spaces, which generally provides us with greater leverage during lease negotiations. 
 GLA We use GLA to refer to the total occupied and unoccupied square footage of a building that is available for tenants (whom we refer to as a Neighbor or our Neighbors or other retailers to lease. 
 Inline space We define an inline space as a space containing less than 10,000 square feet of GLA. 
 Leased Occupancy This metric is calculated as the percentage of total GLA for which a lease has been signed regardless of whether the lease has commenced or the Neighbor has taken possession. High occupancy is an indicator of demand for our spaces, which generally provides us with greater leverage during lease negotiations. 
 Underwritten incremental unlevered yield This reflects the yield we target to generate from a project upon expected stabilization and is calculated as the estimated incremental NOI for a project at stabilization divided by its estimated net project investment. The estimated incremental NOI is the difference between the estimated annualized NOI we target to generate by a project upon stabilization and the estimated annualized NOI without the planned improvements. Underwritten incremental unlevered yield does not include peripheral impacts, such as lease rollover risk or the impact on the long-term value of the property upon sale or disposition. Actual incremental unlevered yields may vary from our underwritten incremental unlevered yield range based on the actual total cost to complete a project and its actual incremental NOI at stabilization. 
 LEASING Leasing is a key driver of growth for our company. 
 Comparable lease We use this term to refer to a lease with consistent terms that is executed for substantially the same space that has been vacant less than twelve months. 
 Comparable rent spread This metric is calculated as the percentage increase or decrease in first-year ABR (excluding any free rent or escalations) on new or renewal leases (excluding options) where the lease was considered a comparable lease. This metric provides an indication of our ability to generate revenue growth through leasing activity. 
 Cost of executing new leases We use this term to refer to certain costs associated with new leasing, namely, leasing commissions, tenant improvement costs, and tenant concessions. 
 Portfolio retention rate This metric is calculated by dividing (i) the total square feet of retained Neighbors with current period lease expirations by (ii) the total square feet of leases expiring during the period. The portfolio retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain Neighbors at our shopping centers as their leases approach expiration. Generally, the costs to retain an existing Neighbor are lower than costs to replace with a new Neighbor. 
 Recovery rate This metric is calculated by dividing (i) total recovery income by (ii) total recoverable expenses during the period. A high recovery rate is an indicator of our ability to recover certain property operating expenses and capital costs from our Neighbors. 
 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE In addition to financial metrics calculated in accordance with GAAP, such as net income or cash flows from operations, we utilize non-GAAP metrics to measure our operational and financial performance. See Non-GAAP Measures below for further discussion on the following metrics. 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization for Real Estate Adjusted EBITDA re To arrive at Adjusted EBITDA re , we adjust EBITDA re , as defined below, to exclude certain recurring and non-recurring items including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability; (ii) other impairment charges; (iii) amortization of basis differences in our investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures; (iv) transaction and acquisition expenses; and (v) realized performance income. We use EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re as additional measures of operating performance which allow us to compare earnings independent of capital structure and evaluate debt leverage and fixed cost coverage. 
 Core Funds From Operations Attributable to Stockholders and OP Unit Holders Core FFO To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust Nareit FFO, as defined below, to exclude certain recurring and non-recurring items including, but not limited to: (i) depreciation and amortization of corporate assets; (ii) changes in the fair value of the earn-out liability; (iii) amortization of unconsolidated joint venture basis differences; (iv) gains or losses on the extinguishment or modification of debt and other; (v) other impairment charges; (vi) transaction and acquisition expenses; and (vii) realized performance income. We believe Nareit FFO provides insight into our operating performance as it excludes certain items that are not indicative of such performance. Core FFO provides further insight into the sustainability of our operating performance and provides an additional measure to compare our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income (loss). 
 EBITDA re The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit defines EBITDA re as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP before: (i) interest expense; (ii) income tax expense; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) gains or losses from disposition of depreciable property; and (v) impairment write-downs of depreciable property. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect EBITDA re on the same basis. 
 PHILLIPS EDISON COMPANY 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q 
 19 

Equity Market Capitalization We calculate equity market capitalization as the total dollar value of all outstanding shares using the closing price for the applicable date. 
 Nareit FFO Attributable to Stockholders and OP Unit Holders Nareit FFO Nareit defines Funds From Operations FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: (i) gains (or losses) from sales of property and gains (or losses) from change in control; (ii) depreciation and amortization related to real estate; (iii) impairment losses on real estate and impairments of in-substance real estate investments in investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures; and (iv) adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We calculate Nareit FFO in a manner consistent with the Nareit definition. 
 Net Debt We calculate net debt as total debt, excluding discounts, market adjustments, and deferred financing expenses, less cash and cash equivalents. 
 Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA re This ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by Adjusted EBITDA re (included on an annualized basis within the calculation). It provides insight into our leverage rate based on earnings and is not impacted by fluctuations in our equity price. 
 Net Debt to Total Enterprise Value This ratio is calculated by dividing net debt by total enterprise value, as defined below. It provides insight into our capital structure and usage of debt. 
 NOI We calculate NOI as total operating revenues, adjusted to exclude non-cash revenue items, less property operating expenses and real estate taxes. NOI provides insight about our financial and operating performance because it provides a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss). 
 Same-Center We use this term to refer to a property, or portfolio of properties, that have been owned and operational for the entirety of each reporting period (i.e., since January 1, 2023). 
 Total Enterprise Value We calculate total enterprise value as our net debt plus our equity market capitalization on a fully diluted basis. 

OVERVIEW 
 We are a REIT and one of the nation s largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping centers. Our portfolio primarily consists of neighborhood centers anchored by the #1 or #2 grocer tenants by sales within their respective formats by trade area. Our Neighbors are a mix of national, regional, and local retailers that primarily provide necessity-based goods and services. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned equity interests in 311 shopping centers, including 290 wholly-owned shopping centers and 21 shopping centers owned through two unconsolidated joint ventures, which comprised approximately 35.2 million square feet in 31 states. In addition to managing our shopping centers, our third-party investment management business provides comprehensive real estate management services to the Managed Funds. 
 2024 SENIOR NOTE ISSUANCES In May 2024, we issued 350 million of 5.750 senior notes due 2034 at an issue price of 98.576 in an underwritten offering. 
 In September 2024, we issued 350 million of 4.950 senior notes due 2035 at an issue price of 98.458 in an underwritten offering. 
 The 2024 senior note issuances are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us.

 Our ability to create rental rate growth generally depends on our leverage during new and renewal lease negotiations with prospective and existing Neighbors, which typically occurs when occupancy at our centers is high or during periods of economic growth and recovery. Conversely, we may experience rental rate decline when occupancy at our centers is low or during periods of economic recession, as the leverage during new and renewal lease negotiations may shift to prospective and existing Neighbors.

 (2) Number of locations excludes auxiliary leases with grocery anchors such as fuel stations, pharmacies, and liquor stores. Additionally, if a parent company has multiple subsidiaries or banners in a single shopping center, those subsidiaries are included as one location. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES The economy continues to face inflation risk, which may negatively impact some of our Neighbors and increase our operating and construction costs. Substantially all of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse effect of inflation, including requirements for Neighbors to pay their allocable share of operating expenses that includes common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, and certain capital expenditures. Additionally, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which allows us to target increased rents to current market rates upon renewal. 
 In addition to inflation, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks may create challenges that could negatively impact market conditions in the United States. Additionally, the policies implemented to address these risks, including raising interest rates, could result in adverse impacts on the United States economy, including a slowing of growth or potentially a recession.

 Our basis for analyzing significant fluctuations in our results of operations generally includes review of the results of our same-center portfolio, non-same-center portfolio, and revenues and expenses from our management activities. We define our same-center portfolio as the 270 properties that were owned and operational prior to January 1, 2023. We define our non-same-center portfolio as those properties that were not fully owned and operational in both periods owing primarily to real estate asset activity occurring after December 31, 2022, which includes one property disposed of and 19 properties acquired. Below are explanations of the significant fluctuations in the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Rental Income increased 12.2 million primarily as follows: 
 3.4 million increase primarily related to our same-center portfolio as follows: 
 4.8 million increase primarily due to a 0.47 increase in average minimum rent PSF; partially offset by 
 0.9 million decrease due to the impact of straight-line rent adjustments. 
 8.8 million increase primarily related to our acquisition activity, net of dispositions. 
 Property Operating Expenses increased 3.3 million primarily as follows: 
 2.1 million increase from our same-center portfolio and corporate operating activities primarily due to an increase in common area maintenance spending and higher compensation and insurance costs; and 
 1.2 million increase primarily due to our acquisition activity, net of dispositions.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 See Key Performance Indicators and Defined Terms above for additional information related to the following non-GAAP measures. 
 
 SAME-CENTER NOI Same-Center NOI is presented as a supplemental measure of our performance, as it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates, and operating costs for our same-center portfolio. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same-Center NOI, and accordingly, our Same-Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Same-Center NOI represents the NOI for the 270 properties that were wholly-owned and operational for the entire portion of all comparable reporting periods. 
 Same-Center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance as it does not reflect the operations of our entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income (expense), or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties that could materially impact our results from operations.

 NAREIT FFO AND CORE FFO Nareit FFO is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. Core FFO is an additional financial performance measure used by us as Nareit FFO includes certain non-comparable items that affect our performance over time. We believe that Core FFO is helpful in assisting management and investors with assessing the sustainability of our operating performance in future periods.

Nareit FFO and Core FFO should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) under GAAP, as an indication of our liquidity, nor as an indication of funds available to cover our cash needs, including our ability to fund distributions. Core FFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate our business plan in the manner currently contemplated. 
 Accordingly, Nareit FFO and Core FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements, and should not be viewed as more prominent measures of performance than net income (loss) or cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our Nareit FFO and Core FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs.

EBITDA re AND ADJUSTED EBITDA re We use EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re as additional measures of operating performance which allow us to compare earnings independent of capital structure, determine debt service and fixed cost coverage, and measure enterprise value. Additionally, we believe they are a useful indicator of our ability to support our debt obligations. 
 EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), as an indication of our liquidity, nor as an indication of funds available to cover our cash needs, including our ability to fund distributions. Accordingly, EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements, and should not be viewed as more prominent measures of performance than net income (loss) or cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 GENERAL Aside from standard operating expenses, we expect our principal cash demands to be for: 
 investments in real estate; 
 cash distributions to stockholders; 
 redevelopment and repositioning projects; 
 capital expenditures and leasing costs; and 
 principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness. 
 We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be: 
 operating cash flows; 
 borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility and proceeds from debt financings; 
 proceeds from any equity offering activities; 
 proceeds received from the disposition of properties; and 
 available, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 
 At this time, we believe our current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our short- and long-term cash demands. 
 ATM Program In February 2022, we and the Operating Partnership entered into a sales agreement relating to the potential sale of shares of common stock pursuant to a continuous offering program. In accordance with the terms of the sales agreement, we could offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 250 million from time to time through our sales agents, or, if applicable, as forward sellers. During the three months ended September 30, 
 PHILLIPS EDISON COMPANY 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 FORM 10-Q

2024, no shares of our common stock were issued under this ATM program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued approximately 46,000 shares of our common stock at a gross weighted average price of 37.05 per share under this ATM program for net proceeds of 1.7 million, after approximately 17,000 in commissions. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 2.0 million shares of our common stock under this ATM program for net proceeds of 70.1 million, after approximately 0.7 million in commissions. 
 In February 2024, we and the Operating Partnership entered into a new sales agreement relating to the potential sale of shares of common stock pursuant to a continuous offering program, which replaced the previous agreement. In accordance with the terms of the sales agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 250 million from time to time through our sales agents, or, if applicable, as forward sellers. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued no shares of our common stock under this ATM program. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 250 million of common stock remained available for issuance under the current ATM program. 
 DEBT The following table summarizes information about our debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

 (1) The revolving credit facility matures in January 2026, extendable at our option to January 2027. In addition, the revolving credit facility includes an accordion feature that permits us to increase our aggregate borrowing capacity thereunder to up to 1 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 (2) Net of any outstanding balance and letters of credit. 
 In May 2024, we issued 350 million of 5.750 senior notes due 2034 at an issue price of 98.576 in an underwritten offering. 
 In September 2024, we issued 350 million of 4.950 senior notes due 2035 at an issue price of 98.458 in an underwritten offering. 
 The 2024 senior note issuances are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. 
 Debt Obligation Guarantees At September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership had issued and outstanding its 2.625 , 4.950 , and 5.750 senior notes. The obligations of the Operating Partnership to pay principal, premiums, if any, and interest on the 2.625 , 4.950 , and 5.750 senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us on a senior basis. As a result of the amendments to SEC Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that: (i) the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company s consolidated financial statements; (ii) the parent guarantee is full and unconditional and (iii) subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. We meet the conditions of this requirement and thus, are not presenting separate financial statements. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership because the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Operating Partnership are not materially different than the corresponding in our consolidated financial statements, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.

 (1) Adjusted EBITDA re is based on a trailing twelve month period. See Non-GAAP Measures - EBITDA re and Adjusted EBITDA re above for a reconciliation to Net Income. 
 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY We make capital expenditures during the course of normal operations, including maintenance capital expenditures and tenant improvements, as well as value-enhancing anchor space repositioning and redevelopment, ground-up outparcel development, and other accretive projects.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had gross capital spend of 55.6 million and 74.3 million, respectively. Below is a summary of our capital spending activity, excluding leasing commissions, on a cash basis (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Capital expenditures for real estate: Capital improvements 11,833 18,336 Tenant improvements 18,723 20,484 Redevelopment and development 18,182 29,276 Total capital expenditures for real estate 48,738 68,096 Corporate asset capital expenditures 690 817 Capitalized indirect costs (1) 
 3,052 3,078 Total capital spending activity (2) 
 52,480 71,991 
 (1) Amount includes internal salaries and related benefits of personnel who work directly on capital projects as well as capitalized interest expense. 
 (2) Amounts reported are net of insurance proceeds of 3.2 million and 2.3 million for property damage claims for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We anticipate that obligations related to capital improvements, as well as redevelopment and development, in 2024 can be met with cash flows from operations, cash flows from dispositions, or borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 Generally, we expect our development and redevelopment projects to stabilize within 24 months. Our underwritten incremental unlevered yields on development and redevelopment projects are expected to range between 9 -12 . Our current in process projects represent an estimated total investment of 45.6 million. Actual incremental unlevered yields may vary from our underwritten incremental unlevered yield range based on the actual total cost to complete a project and its actual incremental annual NOI at stabilization. See Key Performance Indicators and Defined Terms above for further information. 
 REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY We actively monitor the commercial real estate market for properties that have future growth potential, are located in attractive demographic markets, and support our business objectives. The following table highlights our property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Number of properties acquired 8 5 Number of outparcels acquired (1)(2) 
 4 1 Contract price 203,402 92,060 Total price of acquisitions (3) 
 205,002 83,073 
 (1) Outparcels acquired are adjacent to shopping centers that we own. 
 (2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired an outparcel adjacent to a property that is owned by our unconsolidated joint venture, GRP I. Therefore, the outparcel is an addition to our total property count. 
 (3) Total price of acquisitions includes closing costs less credits and assumed liabilities. 
 REAL ESTATE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY We sold no properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, but we recognized a minimal loss on disposal of property due to miscellaneous write-off activity and expenses related to previous and future potential dispositions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold one property and two outparcels at a contract price of 6.3 million, received 7.1 million in proceeds, and recognized a gain on disposal of property of 1.1 million which was primarily due to land acquired from us by local authorities. 
 DISTRIBUTIONS For each month beginning January 2024 through August 2024, we declared and paid monthly distributions of 0.0975 per common share and OP unit. In September 2024, the Board authorized a 5.1 increase of our monthly distribution rate to 0.1025 per common share and OP unit and we declared a monthly distribution of 0.1025 per common share and OP unit for September 2024. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain, and which does not necessarily equal net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP). We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the income that we distribute to our stockholders each year due to meeting the REIT qualification requirements. However, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property, or net worth and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
 We have not established a minimum distribution level, and our charter does not require that we make distributions to our stockholders.

CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 9.3 million, a net cash increase of 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Below is a summary of our cash flow activity (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Net cash provided by operating activities 
 250,707 218,988 31,719 14.5 Net cash used in investing activities 
 (259,621) (146,339) (113,282) (77.4) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 9,369 (81,759) 91,128 111.5 
 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Our net cash provided by operating activities was primarily impacted by the following: 
 Property operations Most of our operating cash comes from rental and tenant recovery income received less property operating expenses, real estate taxes, and general and administrative costs paid. Property operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were positively impacted by a 9.1 million, or 2.9 , improvement in Same-Center NOI as compared to the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net cash inflow of 8.9 million from changes in working capital as compared to a net cash outlay of 7.0 million during the same period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by the timing of interest payments resulting from our 2024 senior note issuances. 
 INVESTING ACTIVITIES Our net cash used in investing activities was primarily impacted by the following: 
 Real estate acquisitions During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our acquisitions resulted in a total cash outlay of 205.0 million, as compared to a total cash outlay of 83.1 million during the same period in 2023. 
 Capital expenditures We invest capital into leasing our properties and maintaining or improving the condition of our properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 55.6 million for capital expenditures, a decrease of 18.7 million over the same period in 2023. 
 FINANCING ACTIVITIES Our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily impacted by the following: 
 Debt borrowings and payments During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 130.4 million in net borrowings primarily as a result of our May and September 2024 senior note issuances, payments on our term loans, and net repayments under our revolving credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had 39.5 million in net repayment of debt primarily as a result of early repayments of mortgage loans. 
 Distributions to stockholders and OP unit holders Cash used for distributions to common stockholders and OP unit holders increased 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in shares of common stock outstanding as a result of issuances under the ATM program and our distribution rate increase.
