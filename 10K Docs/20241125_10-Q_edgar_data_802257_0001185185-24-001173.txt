However, the business failed to achieve profitability, and the markets were not favorable to additional funding, therefore in late 2022 the decision was made to close the clinics and release all employees. 

We are a holding company seeking to provide products, services and technology. We have a number of near-term opportunities that we hope to pursue, assuming the capital markets make sufficient funding available at reasonable rates. During the first quarter of 2024 we recruited a number of individuals to a newly formed Advisory Board, who might assist the Company in determining the viability of certain ventures going forward. These individuals have a background in data center services, cyber and data security and software applications related to infrastructure design, implementation and management including geographical information systems (GIS). 

In June 2024 we announced the formation of two (2) new wholly owned business units, Centcore, LLC, who is providing data center services including cloud computing and application hosting, and Vero Technology Ventures, LLC, whose aim is to seek investment and acquisition opportunities, generally in the areas of cloud computing and data center related applications. 

Centcore has two (2) areas of focus. The first, generic data center services, is aimed at hosting applications for a specific user, sometimes referred to as managed services offerings or MSO, where the client moves the software licensed from various vendors, or internally developed, into our data center where we maintain the computing, communications and backup environment. The second focus involves hosting application software developed by software vendors, from which they will sell the use of the software by their end user clients on a cloud basis. By taking this approach, we gain the business of the vendor, and their clients, perhaps allowing us to grow at a faster rate with lower cost of sales. We have developed the Centcore Partner Program where we will help promote the software vendors who are hosting in our data centers. If we are successful helping the vendor grow his business, we will have provided a value added service , and benefit from increased utilization of our computing resources by not only the vendor, but also his new end user clients. Our initial focus for this area is on software providers who serve the infrastructure market doing design, engineering, construction and maintenance of significant assets. We desire to create life cycle relationships with both the design teams, and owners which may include private owners such as manufacturers and utilities, or publicly owned assets for municipalities, states or federal governments, domestically and internationally. 

We have retained proven professionals in the data center, cyber security and infrastructure services areas to support our needs on a per hour basis, which we believe will allow us to control our costs relative to business activity, without significant staffing internally. The Vero Technology Ventures arm is actively reviewing potential early-stage cloud computing solution vendors and is developing its own artificial intelligence (A.I.) based application set. The new Robo application utilizes A.I. to promote more efficient sales and marketing within certain markets, and with highly targeted market research.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date, we have not generated sufficient revenue from operations to support our operations. We have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities and short-term borrowings. As of November 21, 2024, we had cash of approximately 114,000 compared to cash of approximately 32,000 as of September 30, 2024. Our Company s recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations and our need to raise additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 399,775 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This is the result of the winding down of the Company s clinic operations. Cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 845,947, of which 428,688 was related to cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations. 

The Company had no investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received cash of 102,967 related to the sale of fixed assets used in discontinued operations. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 428,759, compared to 733,664 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by financing activities was the result of cash proceeds from notes payable of 449,000, offset by the repayment of principal on the SBA loan in the amount of 20,241. 

At September 30, 2024, we had the following current liabilities which are payable in cash: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 5.7 million; notes payable of 1.0 million; notes payable to related parties of 0.2 million; SBA Loan Payable of 0.4 million; legal settlements of 2.5 million; accrued interest payable of 0.4 million; accrued interest payable to related parties of 0.01 million; and other current liabilities of 0.1 million. We also have the following liabilities which are payable in stock: derivative liabilities of 0.2 million, preferred stock dividends of 1.7 million, and preferred stock dividends payable to related parties of 0.2 million. 

We have agreements from three (3) of our institutional investors to provide interim funding so that the Company may stay current with its accounting and reporting requirements under the Securities Act of 1934, settle obligations from the prior healthcare clinic operations and find a new business area to engage within. Through September 30, 2024, the total amount loaned under 12-month, 10 interest simple notes are 449,000, with roughly 250,000 attributable to accounting and compliance, 50,000 generally related to settlements and legal related, with the remaining for general expenses including T E and communications. 

In May 2024 we reached an agreement with the holders of our Series F Preferred shares to wave all interest payments permanently beginning May 15, 2024. This creates a reduction in accrued interest of over 200,000 per month. Similar adjustments with other holders of debt and interest paying equity are expected. 

The Company is working with its institutional investors on a plan to eliminate all existing obligations through the issuance of a new preferred stock which would be issued to the holder in lieu of debt. It is envisioned that this stock would be listed and traded separately from the Company s common stock. This plan is in its early stages and there can be no guarantee that it will be fully implemented, approved by the SEC for trading, or accepted by all creditors, some of which may be required to see a reduction in the amounts currently owned in order to get consent from the larger investor group. 

The Company has relationships with a number of consultants who are assisting in the creation of the new business units. It is anticipated that this approach will continue indefinitely as it does not desire to create the overhead associated with a large employment force.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Management uses various estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Accounting estimates that are the most important to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgment by management, are designated as our critical accounting estimates. We have the following critical accounting estimates: 

Estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of derivative liabilities: Management utilizes a lattice model to estimate the fair value of derivative liabilities. The model includes subjective assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such an evaluation, the Company s management has identified what it believes are material weaknesses in the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that we did not have effective disclosure controls and procedures. 

The deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures included (i) lack of segregation of duties and (ii) lack of sufficient resources to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits to the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

The Company intends to take corrective action to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company pursuant to the reports that the Company files or submits to the SEC is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
