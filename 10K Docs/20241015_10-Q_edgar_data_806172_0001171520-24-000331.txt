Corporation. 

The carrying amounts of financial instruments reported in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for current assets and current liabilities approximate the fair value because of the immediate or short-term
maturities of the financial instruments. 

The valuation hierarchy is composed of three levels. The classification within the valuation
hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels within the valuation hierarchy
are described below: 

Level 1 Assets with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges.
Inputs to the fair value measurement are observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs to the fair value measurement are determined using prices for recently
traded assets and liabilities with similar underlying terms, as well as direct or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and
yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 

Level 3 Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs, such as estimates,
assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists for the assets or liabilities. 

Marketable Securities February 29, 2024 

Marketable Securities include certificates of deposit and US Treasury securities that are
considered to be highly liquid and easily tradeable totaling and as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively.
US Treasury securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as Level 1
and certificates of deposit are classified as Level 2 within the Company s fair value hierarchy. The Company s marketable
securities are considered to be trading securities as defined under ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities.

ITEM 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

We discuss expectations regarding our future performance, such as our business outlook,
in our annual and quarterly reports, news releases, and other written and oral statements. These forward-looking statements 
are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain, and
investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations and could cause actual results
to differ materially. These factors include, among other considerations, general economic and business conditions; political, regulatory,
tax, competitive and technological developments affecting our operations or the demand for our products; inflationary and supply chain
pressures; the recovery of the Electronics/Microelectronics and Medical markets; rebound of sales to the industrial market in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2025; maintenance of increased order backlog; the imposition of tariffs; timely development and market acceptance
of new products and continued customer validation of our coating technologies; adequacy of financing; capacity additions, the ability
to enforce patents; maintenance of operating leverage; consummation of order proposals; completion of large orders on schedule and on
budget; continued sales growth in the medical and alternative energy markets; successful transition from primarily selling ultrasonic
nozzles and components to a more complex business providing complete machine solutions and higher value subsystems; and realization of
quarterly and annual revenues within the forecasted range of sales guidance. 

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 

Overview 

Founded in 1975, Sono-Tek Corporation is a global leader in designing and manufacturing
ultrasonic coating systems that are shaping industries and driving innovation worldwide. Our ultrasonic coating systems are used to apply
thin films onto parts used in diverse industries, including microelectronics, alternative energy, medical devices, advanced industrial
manufacturing, and research and development sectors worldwide. Sono-Tek s move into the clean energy sector is showing transformative
results in next-gen solar cells, fuel cells, green hydrogen generation, and carbon capture applications as we shape a sustainable future. 

Our product line is rapidly evolving, transitioning from R D to high-volume production
machines with significantly higher average selling prices, showcasing our market leadership and adaptability. Over the last decade, we
have shifted our business from primarily selling ultrasonic nozzles and components to providing complete machine solutions and higher-value
subsystems to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This strategy has resulted in significant growth of our average unit selling price,
with our larger machines often selling for over 300,000 and system prices sometimes reaching over 1,000,000. Consequently, we have broadened
our addressable market and believe we can grow sales on a larger scale. We expect that we will experience wide variations in both order
flow and shipments from quarter to quarter. 

Our comprehensive suite of thin film coating solutions and application consulting services,
provided by our expert applications engineers to guide our customers in developing the complete coating process, ensures unparalleled
results for our clients and helps some of the world s most promising companies achieve technological breakthroughs and bring them
to market. In anticipation of customer demands, our significant focus on R D efforts allows us to keep pace with industry trends while
continuously innovating. The company strategically delivers its products through a network of direct sales personnel, carefully
chosen independent distributors, and experienced sales representatives located in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia, ensuring
efficient market reach across diverse sectors around the globe. Approximately 35 of our sales were generated outside the United States
and Canada in the first six months of fiscal year 2025. 

12 

We continue to expand our sales capabilities by increasing the size of our direct sales
force and adding new distributors and sales representatives. In addition, we have established testing labs at our distribution partner
sites in China, Taiwan, Germany, Turkey, Korea, and Japan, while also expanding our first testing lab co-located with our manufacturing
facilities in New York. These labs provide significant value for demonstrating the capabilities of our equipment to prospective customers
and enable us to develop custom solutions to meet their needs. 

Our growth strategy is focused on leveraging our innovative technologies, proprietary know-how,
unique talent and experience, and global reach to develop thin-film coating technologies that enable better outcomes for our customers 
products and processes. 

Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Highlights (compared with the second quarter of
fiscal 2024 unless otherwise noted) We refer to the three-month periods ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 as the second quarter of fiscal
2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. 

Net Sales for the quarter decreased by 8 or 477,000 to 5,162,000 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which saw elevated sales due to the resolution of supply chain challenges, which had previously impacted our operations. Second quarter revenue increased 3 sequentially to 5.2 million, meeting guidance of 2 -5 growth, driven by strong shipments to the clean energy and electronics markets. 

Gross Profit decreased 10 or 285,000 to 2,516,000 and the Gross Profit decreased by 100 basis points to 48.7 due to product mix and the reallocation and recharacterization of specific labor expenses from the engineering department to cost of goods sold that started in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 as an outcome of the completion of several successful R D endeavors. 

Operating income decreased 49 or 280,000, to 286,000 primarily due to the decrease in gross profit. 

Interest income, dividend income and unrealized gain on marketable securities increased to 129,000 due to the current high interest rate environment. 

Equipment related backlog on August 31, 2024 reached a record high of 11,472,000, an increase of 7 compared with backlog of 10,707,000 in the prior year period. Combined equipment and service-related backlog on August 31, 2024 was 11,659,628, an increase of 7 compared to equipment and service-related backlog of 10,927,590 in the prior year period. The increase in backlog resulted from the growing orders we have received from the clean energy sector, inclusive of two orders previously announced totaling 5.9 million which are scheduled for delivery in the first half of FY 2026. Due to the increased number and frequency of high Average Selling Price ASP large platform machine orders, our revenue can be highly variable from quarter to quarter resulting in large fluctuations in backlog. 

The Alternative / Clean Energy and Electronics Market grew by 37 and 51 respectively. The Clean Energy market was positively impacted by the shipment of two high ASP production systems shipped to a large solar company, while the Electronics Market was positively impacted by the second shipment of a newly developed coating system with wafer shuttling capabilities directed at the semiconductor market. 

Medical sales decreased primarily as a result of lower demand for our stent and balloon coating systems. However, based on our current backlog and order activity, we project balloon coating system sales to recover in the second half of the year. 

First Half Fiscal 2025 Highlights (compared with the first half of fiscal
2024 unless otherwise noted) We refer to the six-month periods ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 as the first half of fiscal 2025 and fiscal
2024, respectively. 

Net Sales for the first half of fiscal 2025 increased by 10 or 951,000 to 10,193,000, strongly impacted by increased sales from the Alternative Energy Market due to the shipment of three high ASP systems to a large solar company totaling 2,190,000. 

13 

Gross Profit increased 9 to 4,971,000 as a result of increased net sales, and the Gross Profit decreased 70 basis points to 48.8 primarily due to product mix and a realignment of our organizational framework that started in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 as an outcome of completion of several successful R D endeavors, which shifted some costs from R D to COGS. 

Operating Income increased 50,000 to 524,000 due to the increase in gross profit. 

Interest income, dividend income and unrealized gain on marketable securities increased to 282,000 due to the current high interest rate environment. 

As of August 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding debt and had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 11.6 million.

Total sales for the first half of fiscal year 2025 grew by 10 , and total sales for the
second quarter of fiscal year 2025 decreased by 8 . The increase in revenue for the first half of fiscal year 2025 was strongly influenced
by shipments to a substantial customer from the Alternative Energy Market that received shipment of three Integrated Coating Systems totaling
 2,190,000. Fluxing Systems and OEM Systems dipped for both the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025, influenced by a softening
of activity from the Printed Circuit Board Manufacturing sector and a continued decline of activity from our OEM partners located in China
due to the struggling China Economy. Sales of our Multi-Axis Coating Systems decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 primarily
due to the timing of orders.

Sales to the Alternative / Clean Energy market recorded growth of 37 in the second
quarter of fiscal 2025 and 80 for the first half of fiscal 2025, and continue to be influenced by a growing number of customers transitioning
from our R D systems to production scale systems that carry much higher ASPs. Electronics market revenue increased by 51 and 30 ,
respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2025. Growth in the Electronics Market was strongly influenced
by two different shipments of a newly developed coating system with wafer shuttling capability for the semiconductor market, with a total
value of 808,000. Medical systems sales declined by 77 and 40 , respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 and the first
half of fiscal 2025. Medical sales decreased primarily as a result of lower demand for our stent and balloon coating systems. However,
based on our current backlog and order activity, we project balloon coating system sales to recover in the second half of the year. In
contrast, stent coating system sales are likely to remain subdued as several customers in this market have reported slower business activity.
Industrial sales declined by 30 and 46 , respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2025. The reduction
in industrial sales was strongly impacted by 780,000 of sales to the float glass industry in the first half of fiscal year 2024 that
did not repeat in fiscal year 2025. The businesses of our primary American based customers in this market have contracted due to China-based
competition entering the market with inexpensive glass.

In the first half of fiscal 2025, approximately 35 of sales originated outside of the
United States and Canada compared with 40 in the first half of fiscal 2024. 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, approximately 32 of sales originated outside of
the United States and Canada compared with 43 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 

We continue to record strong sales from the U.S., growing 9 and 18 , respectively, in
the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2025. U.S. government initiatives such as the CHIPS ACT and the Inflation
Reduction Act have influenced these strong sales, as well as the continuing trend of onshoring for high technology products. Asia sales
dropped 32 and 21 , respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2025. This dip was influenced by
continued decreased sales to China, while other areas of Asia remain more resilient. Latin America experienced decreased sales of 78 
and 65 , respectively, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2025. The dip in Latin America sales was primarily
attributable to a 465,000 system sold for float glass coating into Mexico in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024 that did not repeat in
the current period.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, gross profit decreased by 285,000, or 10 , compared
with the prior year period. The gross profit margin was 48.7 compared with 49.7 for the prior year period. The decrease in the gross
profit margin was influenced by product mix, inclusive of a decrease in OEM systems sales which typically have high profit margins, a
decrease in Multi-Axis Coating Systems and the reallocation and recharacterization of specific labor expenses from the engineering department
to cost of goods sold that started in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 as an outcome of completion of several successful R D
endeavors During the quarter, the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by favorable warranty expense reserves. 

For the first half of fiscal 2025, gross profit increased by 393,000, or 9 , to 4,971,000
compared with 4,578,000 in the first half of fiscal 2024. The gross profit margin was 48.8 compared with 49.5 for the prior year period.
The decrease in the gross profit margin was influenced by product mix, inclusive of a decrease in OEM systems sales and spare parts sales
which typically have high profit margins, and the reallocation and recharacterization of specific labor expenses from the engineering
department to cost of goods sold that started in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 as an outcome of completion of several successful
R D endeavors. During the first six months of fiscal 2025, the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by favorable warranty
expense reserves and a decrease in outside installation costs.

Research and Product Development: 

 Research and product development costs decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 due
to a decrease in salary associated with the departure of a senior engineer, a decrease in research development materials and the
reallocation and recharacterization of specific labor expenses from the engineering department to cost of goods sold that started in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 as an outcome of the completion of several successful R D endeavors. 

Marketing and Selling : 

 Marketing and selling expenses increased in both the second quarter and the first six months
of fiscal 2025 due to increased commissions and travel and trade show expenses. 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expended approximately 211,000 for commissions
as compared with 164,000 for the prior year period, an increase of 47,000. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, we expended approximately
 407,000 for commissions as compared with 286,000 for the prior year period, an increase of 121,000. The increase in commission expense
is primarily the result of an increase in sales being generated by our external distributors, which are commissioned at a higher rate
than our in-house sales team. 

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salary expense due to the reallocation
of our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Harshbarger s salary to the General and Administrative category as described more fully below
under the heading General and Administrative . 

General and Administrative: 

 General and administrative expenses increased in both the second quarter and first six
months of fiscal 2025 due to increased salaries, legal and audit fees and other corporate expenses. 

16 

Effective January 1, 2024, Steve Harshbarger became our Chief Executive Officer, having
previously served as President prior to such date. We reclassified the expenses related to Mr. Harshbarger's compensation in connection
with this positional change. Prior to January 1, 2024, we classified Mr. Harshbarger s salary under sales expenses because of Mr.
Harshbarger s instrumental role in that area. Upon becoming Chief Executive Officer, we reallocated the costs associated with Mr.
Harshbarger s compensation to the G A category ensuring a more precise representation of resource allocation in our financial
statements. For the first six months of fiscal year 2025, the total reallocated amount of Mr. Harshbarger s salary was approximately
 145,000. 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we were notified by the State
of California that we were required to collect sales tax on our shipments to customers in California. For taxable sales, we collected
approximately 86,000 of delinquent sales tax from our customers in the first six months of fiscal 2025. As of February 29, 2024, on the
basis of a preliminary analysis of our sales to our California customers since April 1, 2019, we recorded an accrual in the amount of
 138,000 for the estimated sales tax, penalties and interest that we may have been required to remit to the State of California. 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we filed all necessary sales
tax returns with the State of California. Our net expense for sales tax and interest amounted to 72,000. In the second quarter of fiscal
2025, we reversed the remaining accrual of 66,000, this reversal is recorded in general and administrative expenses. 

Operating Income : 

 In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, operating income decreased 280,000, or 49 , to 286,000
compared with 566,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating margin for the quarter decreased to 6 compared with 10 in the
prior year period. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, decreases in revenue and gross profit, partially offset by the reversal of the
sales tax accrual were key factors in the decrease of operating income. 

In the first half of fiscal 2025, operating income increased by 50,000, to 524,000, compared
with 474,000 for the first half of fiscal 2024. Operating margin for the first half of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 was 5 . In the first
half of fiscal 2025, an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses were key factors in the increase
of operating income. 

Interest, Dividend Income and Unrealized Gain: 

 Interest and dividend income decreased by 39,000 to 85,000 in the second quarter of fiscal
2025 as compared with 124,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 resulting from decreased cash balances. In the first half of fiscal
2025 interest and dividend income decreased by 2,000 to 228,000 as compared with 230,000 for the first half of fiscal 2024. Our present
investment policy is to invest excess cash in highly liquid, lower risk US Treasury securities. At August 31, 2024, the majority of our
holdings are rated at or above investment grade. 

Net unrealized gain increased 51,000 to 44,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as
compared to a loss of 7,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In the first half of fiscal 2025, unrealized gain increased 43,000
to 54,000 as compared with 11,000 in the first half of fiscal 2025. 

Income Tax Expense: 

 We recorded income tax expense of 74,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared
with 142,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the first half of fiscal 2025, we recorded income tax expense of 134,000 compared
with 121,000 for the first half of fiscal 2024. 

The decrease in income tax expense in the second quarter fiscal
2025 is due to the decrease in income before income taxes partially offset by an increase in permanent timing differences and then
the further reduction of taxes due to the application of available research and development tax credits from this quarter s
increase in research and development expenditures. The deferred tax asset increased approximately 173,000, to 1,429,000 at August
31, 2024 from 1,256,000 at February 29, 2024. Additionally, the deferred tax liability increased approximately 82,000, to 312,000
at August 31, 2024 from 230,000 at February 29, 2024. The net increase in the deferred tax asset and liability was approximately
 91,000 for the first half of fiscal 2025. This increase is primarily due to an increase in capitalized research and development
expenses for tax purposes, partially offset by a decrease in other deferred tax assets and an increase in deferred tax liabilities
related to timing differences for depreciation. 

17 

Net Income: 

 Net income decreased by 200,000 to 341,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared
with 541,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in net income during the second quarter is primarily a result of a decrease
in gross profit. 

Net income increased by 77,000 to 672,000 for the first half of fiscal 2025 compared
with 595,000 for the first half of fiscal 2024. The increase in net income during the first half of fiscal 2025 is primarily a result
of an increase in gross profit partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Working Capital Our working capital increased 823,000 to 12,946,000
at August 31, 2024 from 12,123,000 at February 29, 2024. The increase in working capital was mostly the result of the current period s
net income and noncash charges partially offset by purchases of equipment. 

We aggregate cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in managing our balance
sheet and liquidity. For purposes of the following analysis, the total is referred to as Cash. At August 31, 2024 and February
29, 2024, our working capital included:

of 672,000 and 97,000 in additional equity related to stock-based compensation awards. 

Operating Activities We used 90,000 of cash in our operating activities
in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared to our operating activities providing 1,107,000 of cash in the first half of fiscal 2024, a
decrease of 1,197,000. The decrease was mostly the result of decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, income
taxes payable and an increase accounts receivable. These uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in inventories. 

18 

Investing Activities Our investing activities provided 3,808,000
of cash in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with using 1,007,000 in the first half of fiscal 2024. For the first halves of fiscal
years 2025 and 2024, we used 191,000 and 246,000, respectively, for the purchase or manufacture of equipment, furnishings and leasehold
improvements. 

In the first half of fiscal 2025, we liquidated approximately 4,200,000 of our treasury
bill investments. At August 31, 2024, the balance of 4,200,000 is recorded as cash on our balance sheet with approximately 1,800,000
invested in cash equivalents. 

Net Changes in Cash and Cash Equivalents In the first half of fiscal
2025, our cash balance increased by 3,718,000 as compared to an increase of 100,000 in the first half of 2024. In the first half of
fiscal 2025, our operating activities used 90,000 of cash, our marketable securities provided 3,999,000 of cash and we used 191,000
for the purchase or manufacture of equipment, furnishings and leasehold improvements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations
are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure on contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

Management s estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and expectations regarding future events that are believed to be reasonable under the specific circumstances. 

Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments
and uncertainties and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes
that critical accounting policies are limited to those described below. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other
accounting policies see Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in Form 10-K for the year ended February
29, 2024. 

Accounting for Income Taxes 

 The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this
method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory
tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets
and liabilities. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance
is recognized. We use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities. As of August 31, 2024 and August 31, 2023, there were no uncertain tax provisions. 

Revenue Recognition 

 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange
for those goods or services. 

19 

Judgement is required when determining at what point in time control of the Company s
manufactured equipment is transferred to its customers. Management s judgement is based on each customer contract and the transfer
of control of the equipment to the customer. The sales revenue to be recorded is based on each contract. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

 The computation of the expense associated with stock-based compensation requires the use
of a valuation model. ASC 718 is a complex accounting standard, the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of
estimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, and expected option
forfeiture rates, to value equity-based compensation. The Company currently uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the
fair value of its stock options. The Company primarily uses historical data to determine the assumptions to be used in the Black-Scholes
model and has no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ materially from historical data. However, changes in the assumptions
to reflect future stock price volatility and future stock award exercise experience could result in a change in the assumptions used to
value awards in the future and may result in a material change to the fair value calculation of stock-based awards. ASC 718 requires the
recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income. 

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements
to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require disclosures, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment
expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating officer decision maker CODM ), as well as the aggregate amount
of other segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. The ASU requires that a public entity disclose the
title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing
segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Public entities will be required to provide all annual disclosures currently
required by Topic 280 in interim periods, and entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required
by the amendments in this ASU and existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in
this ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and does not expect the standard will have
a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
 This ASU requires greater disaggregation of information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well
as information on income taxes paid. This ASU applies to all entities subject to income taxes and is intended to help investors better
understand an entity s exposure to potential changes in jurisdictional tax legislation and assess income tax information that affects
cash flow forecasts and capital allocation decisions. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with
early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

Other than ASU 2023-07 and ASU 2023-09 discussed above, accounting
pronouncements issued but not yet effective have been deemed to be not applicable or the adoption of such accounting pronouncements is
not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.

ITEM 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company does not issue or invest in financial instruments or derivatives for trading
or speculative purposes. Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted in the United States, and, as such, are not
subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk. All of our sales transactions are completed in US dollars. 

Although the Company's assets included 5,853,000 in cash and 5,766,000 in marketable
securities, the market rate risk associated with changing interest rates in the United States is not material. 

ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures 

The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures 
(as those terms are defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act ). R. Stephen Harshbarger, Chief Executive Officer (principal executive) and Stephen J. Bagley, Chief Financial Officer (principal
accounting officer) of the Company, have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024. Based
on this evaluation, they have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated
to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding timely disclosure. 

In addition, there were no changes in the Company s internal controls over
financial reporting during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, internal controls over financial reporting.
