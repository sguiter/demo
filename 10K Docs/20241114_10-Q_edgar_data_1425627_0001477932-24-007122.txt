These principal conditions and events, when considered in the aggregate, could indicate it is probable that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. However, the Company has identified factors that may mitigate the probable conditions that have raised substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on an evaluation of current operating cash usage, management identified several areas in which the Company is capable to reduce spend should it be needed. This includes reductions in operating headcount, discretionary sales marketing spend, investor relations initiatives, and product/software research and development planning. Ongoing activities to identify and reduce monthly expenses by management will continue in perpetuity until such time financial liquidity and substantial cash flow from sales are realized. Management believes the defined focus on the multi-vertical Behavioral Health space has positioned the Company to generate improvement in revenue generation and positive cash flows from sales. Management believes that cash balances of approximately and negative working capital of approximately at September 30, 2024, do not provide adequate capital for operating activities for the next twelve months after the date these financial statements are issued. However, management believes actions presently being taken to generate product and services revenues, and positive cash flows, in addition to the Company s ability to access capital sources and implement expense reduction tactics to preserve working capital provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern as of September 30, 2024. These plans are contingent upon the actions to be performed by the Company and these conditions have not been met on or before November 13, 2024. As such, substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated as of September 30, 2024.

Business Operations, Outlook and Challenges We provide non-invasive technologies to quickly and humanely identify the presence of alcohol in individuals. Our mission is to save lives, positively impact behavioral outcomes and individual wellness, increase workplace safety and productivity, and create significant economic benefits. Our non-invasive technologies are integrated within our scalable and patent-pending software platform, SOBRsafe , producing statistical, measurable business and user data. To that end, our SOBRsafe software platform, along with our integrated hardware devices used to provide non-invasive alcohol detection and identity verification, combine to create a robust solution that has current and potential applications in: Behavioral health and wellness Judicial administrative applications Licensing and integration Commercial environments, including but not limited to oil and gas, fleet management, telematics, ride share programs, and general workplace safety Individual consumer use, including co-parenting trust, personal accountability, and young driver safety Our SOBRcheck device is a patent-pending, touch-based identity verification and alcohol detection solution. Users place two fingers on the device sensors, one compares biometric data points from the finger to confirm identity, while the other senses alcohol released through the pores of the fingertip. The touch-based device connects to the SOBRsafe software solution to collect, present and communicate data collected to subscribed parties. The SOBRcheck device has been in commercial production since the first quarter of 2022 and we have executed customer agreements since that time. Our SOBRsure device is a patent-pending, fitness-style wearable band with an alcohol detection solution intended for discrete, low-profile and voluntary use providing real-time alcohol monitoring and GPS tracking. The wearable band is a device which includes a contained sensor which senses alcohol released through the pores of the skin. The wearable band connects to a mobile device via Bluetooth communication where the SOBRsafe mobile application collects and transmits data to the SOBRsafe software solution. The SOBRsure device provides passive, real-time alcohol insights to administrators, clinicians, parents and more, and also includes device removal and service interruption notifications. The SOBRsure is in commercial production and became available for sale in late September 2023. Our SOBRsafe technology can also be deployed across numerous additional devices for various uses. We are currently exploring possible integrations with existing telematics systems and licensing by non-competitive third parties. We believe our device portfolio approach could yield a substantial repository of user data a potentially monetizable asset for statistical analytics. The opportunity to collect data points over time could enable the development of business and insurance liability benchmarking, through artificial intelligence (AI), powerful guidance for perpetual safety improvement and associated cost savings capture. By demonstrating substance-free environments, organizations could deliver a data-driven argument for lowering insurance premiums. We could potentially partner with insurance providers to encourage use of the SOBRsafe devices and/or technology. Design, manufacturing, quality testing and distribution for all SOBRsafe integrated devices takes place in the United States. Our products continue to gain awareness and recognition through trade shows, media exposure, social media and product demonstrations. To generate sales, we have a three-part strategy: 1) direct sales to businesses and consumers, 2) enter into agreements with channel partners and 3) enter into licensing and integration agreements. We currently employ four highly experienced sales professionals facilitating direct sales and channel partner relationships. Licensing and integration opportunities with non-competitive third parties continue in preliminary stages. 26 Table of Contents We anticipate that our outsourced manufacturers can adequately support an increase in sales for the foreseeable future. We expect that we will need to continue to evolve our products and software to meet diverse customer requirements across varied markets. Since inception we have generated significant losses from operations and anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses for the foreseeable future.

The decrease from the operating loss of 1,779,427 as stated above, was offset by a one-time expense incurred for notes payable conversion as well as a reduction in interest income as detailed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to December 31, 2023 Introduction During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the Company s ability to sell and develop products, generate cash flow from operations, and assess competing market developments. The Company will need additional capital in the near term. Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, was 304,537 and our current normalized operating cash flow burn rate is approximately 550,000 per month. 31 Table of Contents Management believes that cash balances at September 30, 2024 do not provide adequate operating capital for operating activities for the twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. However, management believes actions presently being taken to generate product and services revenues, and positive cash flows, in addition to the Company s ability to access capital sources and implement additional expense reduction tactics to preserve working capital, provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. These plans are contingent upon the actions to be performed by the Company and these conditions have not been met on or before September 30, 2024. As such, substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated as of September 30, 2024. Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and as of December 31, 2023, respectively, are as follows: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Cash 304,537 2,790,147 (2,485,610 Total current assets 930,296 3,371,470 (2,441,174 Total assets 3,349,452 6,147,039 (2,797,587 Total current liabilities 1,194,337 1,522,842 (328,505 Total liabilities 1,315,921 4,164,502 (2,848,581 Our total current assets and total assets decreased as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to use of cash to support our negative cash flow from operations of approximately 2,500,000 accompanied by scheduled amortization reducing the balances of our intellectual technology and right of use assets by approximately 370,000. Our total current liabilities and total liabilities decreased as of September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in total liabilities is primarily due to the conversion of the outstanding convertible debt balances and related interest expense due in March 2025 by the noteholders to equity during the second quarter of 2024 of approximately 2,450,000. Other decreases include a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately 510,000, offset by current notes payable for insurance premiums of approximately 162,000. Sources and Uses of Cash Operations We had net cash used in operating activities of 4,911,028 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 4,705,018 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. For the period in 2024, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of 6,424,505, offset by non-cash expense items including amortization of 289,098, amortization of debt discounts of 237,250, stock-based compensation expense of 584,551, non-cash interest expense of 336,510, non-cash lease expense of 67,315, non-cash conversion expense of 585,875 and changes in our assets and liabilities for accounts receivable of 20,573), inventory of 72,798, prepaid expenses of 86,566, other assets of 21,534), accounts payable of 200,355), accrued expenses of 306,941), accrued interest payable of 126,086), bad debt expense of 202, and operating lease liabilities of 71,199). For the period in 2023, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of 7,673,030, offset by non-cash expense items including amortization of 289,098, amortization of debt discounts of 417,647, loss on extinguishment of debt of 26,125, stock-based compensation expense of 1,836,674, non-cash interest expense of 29,638, non-cash lease expense of 34,714, bad debt expense of 1,132 and changes in our assets and liabilities for accounts receivable of 3,456, inventory of 51,721), prepaid expenses of 571,129, other assets of 18,411), accounts payable of 106,054, accrued expenses of 13,171, accrued interest payable of 281,079), related party payables of 1,887), and operating lease liabilities of 7,728). Investments We had no cash provided by or used in investing activities during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, or September 30, 2023. 32 Table of Contents Financing We received gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants of 2,786,174 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, which was offset by transactional costs of 360,756). During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we received gross proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable of 3,000,001 which was offset by issuance costs of 537,750. Payments of 2,211,661 were made toward the principal and accrued interest amounts for matured convertible notes payable issued in 2021, due in March 2025, to both related and non-related parties. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At September 30, 2024, the Company had contractual commitments to make payments under operating leases. Payments due under these commitments are as follows: Total Due Within 1 Year Operating lease obligations 229,204 107,620 Total contractual cash obligations 229,204 107,620 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Effects of Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenue or operating results during the periods presented. However, continued increases in inflation could have an adverse effect on our results of future operations, financial position, and liquidity in 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, or subsequently thereto, that we believe are of potential significance to our financial statements. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(c) and 15d 15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who are our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, respectively, concluded that, as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Additionally, in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable judgment. (b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies, which may be identified during this process. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. (c) Officer s Certifications Appearing as an exhibit to this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Certifications are required pursuant to Sections 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Section 302 Certifications ). This section of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains information concerning the Controls Evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications. This information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 34 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 Legal Proceedings On December 6, 2006, Orange County Valet and Security Patrol, Inc. filed a lawsuit against us in Orange County California State Superior Court for Breach of Contract in the amount of 11,164. A default judgment was taken against us in this matter. In mid-2013 we learned the Plaintiff s perfected the judgment against us, but we have not heard from the Plaintiffs as of May 2024. In the event we pay any money related to this lawsuit, IDTEC, LLC agreed, in connection with us closing the asset purchase transaction with IDTEC, to pay the amount for us in exchange for shares of our common stock. On January 22, 2024, the Company was named as a party to a complaint filed in Oakland County Court, Michigan by a former employee. The case was initially filed in the 6 th Judicial District Circuit of Michigan. However, on February 15, 2024, the case was removed to the Federal Courts. The former employee is claiming breach of contract, unlawful termination and promissory estoppel. The Company has denied these claims. A settlement agreement was agreed to with the former employee where the Company is to remit a settlement in exchange for a full release and dismissal of the lawsuit. The Company anticipates that the case will be dismissed before the end of the year. In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein, matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
