 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED 

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and and 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company has stockholders 
deficit of and , respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The Company s plans regarding those concerns are addressed in the following paragraph. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

In response to current
financial conditions, the Company has actively explored new prominent media projects in order to provide a wider range of media and advertising
services and improve our financial performance. If the project can start to operate, the Company expects that the project will improve
the Company s future financial performance. The Company expects that the new project can generate positive cashflow. 

The existing cash and
cash equivalents together with highly liquid current assets are insufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next twelve
months. The Company will need to rely upon some combination of cash generated from the Company s operations, or proceeds from the
issuance of the Company s equity and debt securities as well as the exercise of the conversion option by the Company s note
holders to convert the notes to the Company s common stock, in order to maintain the Company s operations. Based on the Company s
best estimates, the Company believes that there are sufficient financial resources to meet the cash requirements for the coming twelve
months and the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. However, there can be no assurance the Company
will be able to continue as a going concern. These uncertainties may result in adverse effects on the continuation of the Company as a
going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
these uncertainties.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
May 1, 2024. The disclosures made in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements generally do not repeat those in the annual
statements. 

years 

The Company elected to not separate non-lease
components from the associated lease components and to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term
of twelve months or less. 

. The 1 convertible promissory notes bore interest
at per annum, payable in arrears, matured on , and were convertible at any time into shares of the Company s
common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. 

The Company determined the 1 convertible promissory
notes to be conventional convertible instruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Its embedded conversion option qualified
for equity classification. The 1 convertible promissory notes did not have any embedded conversion option which shall be bifurcated and
separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815, nor did they contain a cash conversion feature. The Company accounted for the
Notes in accordance with ASC 470, as a single debt instrument. No beneficial conversion feature (the BCF was recognized
as the set conversion price for the Notes was greater than the fair value of the Company s share price at date of issuance. 

1 Convertible Promissory Notes, due in 2027 

On January 18, 2022, the Company entered into
a Subscription Agreement under which the Subscriber agreed to purchase the 1 Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement from the Company
for an agreement purchase price of two million five hundred thousand US Dollars ). On the same date, the Company signed the
with 1 Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement under which the Company may sell and issue to the Subscriber up to an aggregate maximum
amount of 2,500,000 in principal amount of Convertible Notes prior to January 19, 2027. The Convertible Promissory Notes issued to the
Investor are convertible at the holder s option into shares of Company common stock at per share. 

The Company evaluates the conversion feature to
determine whether it was beneficial as described in ASC 470-20. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible
note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible notes payable and may not be settled in cash upon
conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible notes payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance
to the date the notes is due using the effective interest method. If the notes payable are retired prior to the end of their contractual
term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature
is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included
in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the shares of common stock at the commitment date to be received upon conversion. 

On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06
to financial instruments outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of adoption recognized
at the date of initial application through an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Under this method, EPS amounts are
not restated in prior periods presented. 

On May 13, 2024, as requested by the Convertible
Note holders, the Company agreed to change the conversion price to 0.5 per shares. The two 1 Convertible Promissory Notes due 2025 and
2027 were cancelled and re-issued to the Investors at the holders option into shares of Company common stock at 0.5 per share. 

The Company recognize revenue when a customer
obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive
in exchange for such services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: 

1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer -
A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party s rights
regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to those goods or services, (ii) the contract
has commercial substance and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred
is probable based on the customer s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer s
ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer s historical payment experience or,
in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. The contract term for contracts
that provide a right to terminate a contract for convenience without significant penalty will reflect the term that each party has enforceable
rights under the contract (the period through the earliest termination date). If the termination right is only provided to the customer,
the unsatisfied performance obligations will be evaluated as customer options as discussed below. 

2) Identify the performance obligations in the
contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the
customer that are both (i) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together
with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and (ii) are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby
the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are not met the
promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Certain of our contracts (under which we deliver multiple
promised services) require us to perform integration activities where we bear risk with respect to integration activities. Therefore,
we must apply judgment to determine whether as a result of those integration activities and risks, the promised services are distinct
on the context of the contract. 

We typically do not include options that would
result in a material right. If options to purchase additional services or options to renew are included in customer contracts, we evaluate
the option in order to determine if our arrangement include promises that may represent a material right and needs to be accounted for
as a performance obligation in the contract with the customer. 

3) Determine the transaction price - The transaction
price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.
Our contract prices may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or a combination of both fixed and variable amounts. To the extent the
transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction
price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration.
When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, management considers whether there are factors outside our control that
could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, we consider the likelihood and magnitude of a potential
reversal of revenue. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required. 

4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the
single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price
to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets
the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance
obligation. For most performance obligations, we determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation
is sold separately. Although uncommon, if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone
selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to
the performance obligations.

History 

We were incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 10, 1993, under the name EC Capital Limited. Our predecessor companies were involved
in a variety of businesses and were operated by various management teams under different operating names. Between 2004 and 2006 we operated
under the name Teda Travel Group Inc., which was primarily engaged in the provision of management services to hotels and resorts in China.
On August 1, 2006, we changed our name to Network CN Inc. in order to better reflect our new vision to build a nationwide
information and entertainment network in China. 

Network CN Inc. a Delaware
holding company with headquarter in Hong Kong and its operations conducted in China. During the latter half of 2006, we adjusted our primary
focus away from the tourism and hotel management business to the building of a media network with the goal of becoming a nationwide leader
in out-of-home, digital display advertising, roadside LED digital video panels and mega-size video billboards. Since PRC regulations limit
foreign ownership of companies that provide advertising services, our advertising business was initially provided through our contractual
arrangements with our Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). 

In early 2010, the Company
fulfilled the requirements to directly own 100 of advertising business company in China, in order to increase our operational efficiency
and effectiveness, we restructured our organization by consolidating our PRC operations into one directly owned PRC entity and no VIEs
conduct business. Since 2010, we conduct 100 of our business through our wholly owned subsidiaries in PRC.

involves unique risks to investors. 

There are legal and operational
risks associated with being based in and having all our operations in Hong Kong and China. The Chinese government recently took regulatory
actions on certain U.S. listed Chinese companies and made statement that it will exert more oversight and control over offerings and listings
by Chinese companies that are conducted overseas, such as those related to the use of variable interest entities and data security or
anti-monopoly concerns. On July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office
of the State Council jointly issued an announcement to crack down on illegal activities in the securities market and promote the high-quality
development of the capital market, which, among other things, requires the relevant governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border
oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over China-based companies listed overseas, and to establish
and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities laws. On December 28, 2021, Cybersecurity Review Measures

of more than 10,000 people to overseas since January 1st of the previous year; and (iv) other circumstances under
which the data cross-border transfer security assessment is required as prescribed by the CAC. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released
the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Enterprises (the New Overseas Listing
Rules with five interpretive guidelines, which took effect on March 31, 2023. The New Overseas Listing Rules require
Chinese domestic enterprises to complete filings with relevant governmental authorities and report related information under certain circumstances,
such as: a) an issuer making an application for initial public offering and listing in an overseas market; b) an issuer making an overseas
securities offering after having been listed on an overseas market; c) a domestic company seeking an overseas direct or indirect listing
of its assets through single or multiple acquisition(s), share swap, transfer of shares or other means. The required filing scope is not
limited to the initial public offering, but also includes subsequent overseas securities offering, single or multiple acquisition(s),
share swap, transfer of shares or other means to seek an overseas direct or indirect listing and a secondary listing or dual major listing
of issuers already listed overseas. According to the Notice on Arrangements for Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Enterprises,
published by the CSRC on February 17, 2023, a company that (i) has already completed overseas listing or (ii) has already
obtained the approval for the offering or listing from overseas securities regulators or exchanges but has not completed such offering
or listing before effective date of the new rules and also completes the offering or listing before September 30, 2023 will
be considered as an existing listed company and is not required to make any filing until it conducts a new offering in the future. Furthermore,
upon the occurrence of any of the material events specified below after an issuer has completed its offering and listed its securities
on an overseas stock exchange, the issuer shall submit a report thereof to the CSRC within 3 working days after the occurrence and
public disclosure of the event: (i) change of control; (ii) investigations or sanctions imposed by overseas securities regulatory
agencies or other competent authorities; (iii) change of listing status or transfer of listing segment; or (iv) voluntary or
mandatory delisting. The new rules provide that the determination as to whether a domestic company is indirectly offering and listing

and listing shall be determined as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a Chinese domestic company: (i) any of the revenue, profit,
total assets or net assets of the Chinese domestic entity is more than 50 of the related financials in the issuer s audited consolidated
financial statements for the most recent fiscal year; (ii) the senior managers in charge of business operation and management of the issuer

activities are conducted in China. 

We are headquartered

profits are generated by our subsidiaries in China. As of the date of this report, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted the
Company s ability to conduct its business, accept foreign investments, or list and trade on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. The
Company is headquartered in Hong Kong and it owns 100 equity interest of all its subsidiaries and our VIEs did not conduct any business
and we conduct advertising services and believes the new data security or anti-monopoly laws and regulations of China do not apply to
the Company or its subsidiaries. However, any change in foreign investment regulations, and other policies in China or related enforcement
actions by China government could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our ordinary shares and could significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer our ordinary shares to investors or cause the value of our ordinary shares to significantly
decline or be worthless. The Company s auditor is headquartered in the U.S. and it is not subject to the determinations announced
by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021, which determinations were vacated on December 15, 2022, and Holding Foreign Companies Accountable

(CAC) or any other governmental agency that is required to approve our business and operations. However, the Chinese government may intervene
or influence our operations in China or any securities offering at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations
and our ordinary shares could decline in value or become worthless. We provide media and advertising services through lightboxes or billboards
and services do not pose national security risks, we are not subject to the report requirement under Cybersecurity Review Measures published
by Cyberspace Administration of China, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry
of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, People s Bank of China, State Administration
of Radio and Television, China Securities Regulatory Commission, State Secrecy Administration and State Cryptography Administration on
December 28, 2021, which became effective on February 15, 2022. 

As of the date of this
report, we (1) are not required to obtain permissions from any PRC authorities to issue our ordinary shares to foreign investors,
(2) are not subject to permission requirements from CSRC, CAC or any other entity that is required to approve of our operations in
China, and (3) have not received or were denied such permissions by any PRC authorities. 

We are headquartered
in Hong Kong with our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and all members of the board of directors based in Hong Kong who
are not Chinese citizens. Although we don t believe we are a Chinese domestic entity as defined in the New Overseas Listing Rules published
by CSRC on February 17, 2023, it is not certain whether we might be determined as a Chinese entity under new rules, which will require
us to file related documents with CSRC. Also, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General
Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to
Law, or the Opinions, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen
the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies.
Given the current PRC regulatory environment, it is uncertain when and whether our PRC subsidiary, will be required to obtain permission
from the PRC government in connection with our listing on U.S. exchanges in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether
it will be denied or rescinded. If we or our subsidiaries do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, inadvertently conclude
that such permissions or approvals are not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to
obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, it could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue
to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 78,849, as compared to 171,907 for the corresponding prior year period. This was mainly attributable
to decrease in accounts receivables and inventories during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Our cash flow projections indicate that our current
assets and projected revenues from our existing project will not be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. This raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We intend to rely on the issuance of additional equity and debt securities
as well as on our noteholders exercise of their conversion option to convert our notes to our common stock, in order to fund our
operations. However, it may be difficult for us to raise funds in the current economic environment. We cannot give assurance that we will
be able to generate sufficient revenue or raise new funds, and our note holders will exercise their conversion option before the note
is due. In any such case, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

Investing Activities

nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were nil and nil respectively. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 57,582 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 141,906 for the corresponding prior year period. The decrease

the Company shall have the option to shorten or extend the life of those short-term loans if the need arises and the Company has agreed

free of restrictions. We may transfer of funds from Hong Kong subsidiaries or BVI subsidiaries to PRC subsidiaries are subject to review
and conversion of HK or US to Renminbi Yuan RMB ), which represents the SAFE to monitor foreign exchange activities. Under

 Table of Contents 

We may face difficulties
or limitations on our ability to transfer cash to any wholly foreign-owned enterprises: Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries,
as wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China, may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated after-tax profits as determined
in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at
least 10 of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount
of such funds reaches 50 of its registered capital. At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may allocate a portion of its
after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to discretional funds. These reserve funds and discretional funds are not distributable
as cash dividends. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned company out of China is subject to examination by the banks designated
by SAFE and declaration and payment of withholding tax. Additionally, if our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future,
the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to us. As a holding
company, we may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiaries, including our PRC subsidiaries, for our
cash and financing requirements. However, our PRC subsidiaries will not be able to pay dividends until they generate accumulated profits
and meet the requirements described above. Also, PRC may impose greater restrictions on our Hong Kong subsidiaries abilities
to transfer cash out of Hong Kong and to the holding company, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. PRC laws and regulations allow an offshore holding company to provide funding
to our wholly owned subsidiary in China only through loans or capital contributions, subject to the filing or approval of government authorities
and limits on the amount of capital contributions and loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval
requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our wholly owned subsidiaries in China or make additional capital contributions to
fund their capital expenditures or working capital. For an increase of its registered capital, the subsidiaries need to file such change
of registered capital with the MOFCOM or its local counterparts. If the holding company provides funding to its subsidiaries through loans,
the total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference between the entity s total investment as approved by the foreign investment
authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be registered with SAFE or its local branches. 

The
PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiaries dividends and other distributions
may be subject to tighten scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies
and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures
necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries
in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make
other payments. There are no other material restrictions on foreign currency restrictions with respect to our ability to transfer payments
among our subsidiaries to the holding company and by holding company as a distribution to the holders of the Company. Other than discussed
above, we don t have any cash management policies that dictate the amount of such funding among our subsidiaries. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the unaudited consolidated financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might

that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues

identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small
staff that 1) insufficient segregation of duties and effective risk assessment and 2) lack of accounting staff with sufficient US GAAP
experience.

Remediation of Material
Weakness 

We will try our best
effort to fulfill our staff shortage. However, current talent availability in market is tough and we need more efforts to compete for
staff in the open market. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We regularly review our system of internal
control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring
that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

There has been no change to our internal control
over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
