 Overview 
 We were formed on September 3, 2020 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have conducted and expect to further conduct private offerings of our common limited liability company units (the Units to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. On July 22, 2021, we filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also filed an election to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and have made such an election beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2022. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. 
 On May 27, 2021 Inception Date ), the we and issued 10 Common Units at an aggregate purchase price of 1.0 thousand to TCW Asset Management Company TAMCO ). On January 21, 2022, (the Initial Closing Date we began accepting subscription agreements from investors for the private sale of our Units and we completed the first closing of the sale of our Units pursuant to which we sold 4,543,770 Units for an aggregate purchase price of 454.4 million. On July 8, 2022 we completed the second closing of the sale of our Units pursuant to which we sold 2,178,280 Common Units for an aggregate offering price of 217.8 million. On November 14, 2022, we completed the third closing of the sale of our Common Units pursuant to which we sold 642,500 Common Units for an aggregate offering price of 64.3 million 
 On January 6, 2023, our Board of Directors (the Board approved a 6-month extension of the period for which we may continue to accept subscription agreements and issue Units (the Closing Period from January 21, 2023 to July 21, 2023. On July 26, 2023, our Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement was amended to extend the Closing Period to be the twenty-four month period following our initial closing, until January 21, 2024 by a majority vote of our Unitholders.. On April 3, 2023, we completed the fourth closing of the sale of our Common Units pursuant to which we sold 1,025,550 Common Units for an aggregate offering price of 102.6 million.

On January 18, 2024, we completed the seventh closing of the sale of our Common Units pursuant to which we sold 734,300 Common Units for an aggregate offering price of 73.4 million. On February 16, 2024, our Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement was amended such that the definition of the Closing Period was amended to be the twenty-six month period following the Initial Closing Date which ended on March 21, 2024. On March 19, 2024, we completed the final closing of the sale of our Common Units pursuant to which the Company sold 1,302,300 Common Units for an aggregate offering price of 130.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 12,745,660 Units for an aggregate offering price of 1.3 billion. Each Unitholder is obligated to contribute capital equal to their Commitment and each Unit s Commitment obligation is 100.00 per unit. The sale of the Units was made pursuant to subscription agreements entered into by us and each investor. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, we may draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Unit generally upon at least ten 
 35 

business days prior written notice to the unitholders. The amount of capital that remains to be drawn down and contributed is referred to as an Undrawn Commitment. All Units that are issued will be issued prior to the end of the Closing Period. 
 Our Commitment Period commenced on the Initial Closing Date and will end on February 1, 2026, which is the later of (a) January 21, 2026, four years from the Initial Closing Date and (b) February 1, 2026, four years from the date in which the Company first completed an investment. However, the Commitment Period is subject to termination upon the occurrence of Key Person Event defined as follows: A Key Person Event will occur if, during the Commitment Period, (i) Richard T. Miller and one or more Suzanne Grosso, Mark Gertzof and David Wang (each of such four Persons, a Key Person and collectively, the Key Persons fail to devote substantially all (i.e. more than 85 of his or her business time to the investment activities of the Company, the prior funds, any successor funds and any fund(s) managed by the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser that are managed within the Private Credit Group (together, the Related Entities or (ii) Ms. Grosso, Mr. Gertzof and Mr. Wang all fail to devote substantially all of their business time to the investment activities of the Company and the Related Entities, in each case other than as a result of a temporary disability; provided that if a replacement has been approved as described in the paragraphs below, such replacement shall be specifically designated to take the place of one of the above-named individuals and the definition Key Person Event will be amended to take into account such successor. 
 Upon the occurrence of a Key Person Event, and in the event that the Adviser fails to replace the above-referenced individuals in the manner contemplated by the last sentence of this paragraph, the Commitment Period shall be automatically terminated upon such Key Person Event. The Commitment Period will be re-instated upon the vote or written consent of 66 2/3 in interest of the Unitholders. The Adviser is permitted at any time to replace any person designated above with a senior professional (including a Key Person) selected by the Adviser, provided that such replacement has been approved by a majority of the Unitholders (in which case, the approved substitute will be a Key Person in lieu of the person replaced). The determination of whether a Key Person Event has occurred will be made by the Company in accordance with the criteria set out above. If, during the Commitment Period, any Key Person shall fail to devote substantially all of his or her business time to the investment activities of the Company and the Related Entities other than as a result of temporary disability (the occurrence of such event, a Key Person Departure ), the Company shall provide written notice to Unitholders of such Key Person Departure within 30 days of the date of such Key Person Departure. If the Company fails to obtain approval of a replacement of a Key Person following a Key Person Departure as provided herein, then notwithstanding anything herein, the Key Person Departure shall be permanent and the Adviser shall not be permitted to replace such Key Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser is permitted at any time to replace any Person designated above with a senior professional (including a Key Person) selected by the Adviser, with the approval of the majority of the Unitholders (in which case, the approved substitute shall be a Key Person in lieu of the Person replaced) no later than 90 days after the date that the Adviser informs the Company of its proposed replacement of the Key Person. If such replacement(s) end the occurrence of a Key Person Event, the Commitment Period will automatically be re-instated. 
 In accordance with the Company s amended and restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, the Company may complete investment transactions that were significantly in process as of the end of the Commitment Period and which the Company reasonably expects to be consummated prior to 90 days after the expiration date of the Commitment Period. The Company may also effect follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies up to an aggregate maximum of 10 of aggregate cumulative invested amounts. 
 We commenced operations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. 
 On May 13, 2022, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TCW DL VIII Financing LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company. On April 2, 2024, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TCW DL HDR LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income and capital appreciation by providing private capital to middle market companies operating in a broad range of industries primarily in the United States. Our highly negotiated private investments include senior secured loans, unsecured senior loans, subordinated and mezzanine loans, convertible securities, notes and other non-convertible debt securities, equity securities, and equity-linked securities such as options and warrants. However, our investment bias is towards adjustable-rate, senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market developing for our private investments. Although we do not currently expect the Private Credit Group to originate a significant amount of investments for us with the use of payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest features, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, from time to time we may make investments that contain such features or that subsequently incorporate such features after origination. 
 36 

We are primarily focused on investing in senior secured debt obligations, although there may be occasions where the investment may be unsecured. We also consider an equity investment as the primary security, in combination with a debt obligation, or as a part of total return strategy. Our investments are mostly in corporations, partnerships or other business entities. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we may co-invest with other investors and/or strategic partners indirectly in a company through an investment vehicle. While we invest primarily in U.S. companies, there are certain instances where we invest in companies domiciled elsewhere. 
 Expenses 
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business will be provided through the Administration Agreement and the Advisory Agreement. 
 We, and indirectly our Unitholders, will bear all costs, expenses and liabilities, other than Adviser Operating Expenses (as defined below, and which shall be borne by the Adviser), in connection with our organization, operations, administration and transactions Company Expenses ).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts reimbursed pursuant to the Company Expenses Limitation in any year may be carried forward by the Adviser and recouped in future years where the Company Expenses Limitation is not exceeded but in no event will we carryforward to future periods the amount by which actual annual Company Expenses for a year exceed the Company Expenses Limitation for more than three years from the date on which such expenses were reimbursed.

 In connection with our borrowings, our lenders require us to pledge assets, Commitments and/or the right to draw down on Commitments. In this regard, the Subscription Agreement contractually obligates each of our investors to fund their respective Commitments in order to pay amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations. 
 Costs incurred to organize the Company are expensed as incurred. Offering costs are accumulated and will be charged directly to Members Capital at the end of the period during which Units will be offered (the Closing Period ). We will not bear more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate capital commitments to the Company through the Units (in aggregate, the Commitments of the Company for organization and offering costs in connection with the offering of the Units through the Closing Period. Since inception, we have expensed 0.7 million in organizational costs, of which 2.0 thousand and 22.0 thousand was expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Since inception, we have incurred 0.3 million of offering costs all of which were charged directly to Members Capital as of September 30, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value according to procedures approved by the Board based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Adviser as the "valuation designee" with respect to the fair valuation of our portfolio securities, subject to oversight by and periodic reporting to the Board. 
 Fair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us into three levels based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value: 
 38 

Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs. 
 Level 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets. 
 Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
 Level 1 Assets (Investments) : The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows: 
 Equity, (Level 1) , generally includes common stock valued at the closing price on the primary exchange in which the security trades. 
 Level 2 Assets (Investments) : The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows: 
 Equity, (Level 2) , generally includes warrants valued using quotes for comparable investments. 
 Level 3 Assets (Investments): The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine the fair value of investments in private debt and equity for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable. 
 Debt, (Level 3) , includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. An income method approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital and discount rate or a market method approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets are generally used to determine fair value, though some cases use an enterprise value waterfall method. Valuation may also include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events. 
 Equity , (Level 3), generally includes common stock, preferred stock and warrants. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA; market multiples of comparable companies; comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; and contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. When a Black-Scholes pricing model is used it follows the income approach. The pricing model takes into account the contract terms as well as multiple inputs, including: time value, implied volatility, equity prices and interest rates. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied. 
 Pricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments. 
 Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of 47 debt investments and one equity investment. Based on fair values as of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was 100.0 invested in debt investments which were all senior secured term loans and revolving loans and 0.0 invested in an equity investment which was a warrant. A debt investment in one portfolio company was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024, representing 0.0 and 0.6 of our portfolio's fair value and cost, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio consisted of 32 debt investments and no equity investments. Based on fair values as of December 31, 2023, our portfolio was 100.0 invested in debt investments which were all senior secured term loans.

The increase in total investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in the number of debt investments in our portfolio, which increased to 47 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 30 as of September 30, 2023 in addition to increases in interest rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other fee income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease late closer fees received from investors purchasing Units

Our total expenses before expenses recaptured for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.0 million and 12.9 million, respectively. Our total expenses before expenses recaptured included management fees attributed to the Adviser of 2.8 million and 2.2 million as well as incentive fees of 1.8 million and 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our total expenses before expenses recaptured for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 44.7 million and 27.5 million, respectively. Our total expenses before expenses recaptured included management fees attributed to the Adviser of 8.0 million and 4.9 million as well as incentive fees of 7.7 million and 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Total expenses include an expense recapture of 2.0 thousand and 0, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The expense recapture during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects Company Expenses (as defined in our Administration Agreement) that we incurred which fell below our annual 12.5 basis point limit (i.e. in accordance with our Administration Agreement, we will not bear Company Expenses more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of aggregate commitments annually). As our expenses fell below the 12.5 basis point limit, we are required to reimburse the Adviser for amounts previously reimbursed by them to us. 
 Total expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in interest and credit facility expenses caused by a higher weighted average interest rate and higher average outstanding debt balance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management fees increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in the size of our portfolio of debt investments as previously described. 
 Incentive fees increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in net investment income. Incentive fees decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a reduction in incentive fee which was due to the mark down of investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

In order to finance certain investment transactions, we may, from time to time, enter into repurchase agreements with Macquarie US Trading LLC Macquarie ), whereby we sell to Macquarie an investment that we hold and concurrently enter into an agreement to repurchase the same investment at an agreed-upon price at a future date, not to exceed 90-days from the date it was sold (each, a Macquarie Transaction ). 
 Additionally, we may, from time to time, enter into repurchase agreements with Barclays Bank PLC Barclays ), whereby we sell to Barclays our short-term investments and concurrently enter into an agreement to repurchase the same investments at an agreed-upon price at a future date, generally within 30-days (each, a Barclays Transaction and together with the Macquarie Transactions, the Repurchase Transactions ). 
 These Repurchase Transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings. Accordingly, the investments financed by these Repurchase Transactions remain on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as an asset, and we record a liability to reflect our repurchase obligation to Macquarie and Barclays (the Repurchase Obligations ). The Repurchase Obligations are presented on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as Repurchase Obligations. The Repurchase Obligations are secured by the respective investment or short-term investment that is the subject of the repurchase agreement. Interest expense associated with the Repurchase Obligations is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest expense on repurchase transactions. 
 47 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not enter into or settle any Macquarie Transactions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding Repurchase Obligations with Macquarie. 
 We did not enter into any Barclays Transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we entered into Barclays Transactions on January 1, 2023, April 3, 2023, and June 30, 2023 which settled on January 25, 2023, April 25, 2023, and July 5, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding Repurchase Obligations with Barclays. 
 Interest expense incurred on the Repurchase Obligations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0 and 0.2 million, respectively. Interest expense incurred on the Repurchase Obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0 and 1.1 million, respectively.

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 100 of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months. As of September 30, 2024, the percentage of our floating rate debt investments that bore interest based on an interest rate floor was 0.0 . Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months only if the index exceeds the floor. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding the related incentive compensation impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (dollar amounts in thousands):

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
