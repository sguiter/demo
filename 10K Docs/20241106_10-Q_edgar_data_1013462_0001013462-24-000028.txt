 million. As such charges are not probable at this time, an estimated liability has not been recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The service tax issues raised in our notices and inquiries are very similar to the case, M/s Microsoft Corporation (I) (P) Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Service Tax, New Delhi, wherein the Delhi Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) issued a favorable ruling to Microsoft. The Microsoft ruling was subsequently challenged in the Supreme Court of India by the Indian tax authority and a decision is still pending. We can provide no assurances on the impact that the present Microsoft case's decision will have on our cases, however, an unfavorable ruling in the Microsoft case may impact our assessment of probability and result in the recording of a million estimated liability. We are uncertain as to when these service tax matters will be concluded. 
 We sell software licenses and services to our customers under contractual agreements. Such agreements generally include certain provisions indemnifying the customer against claims, by third parties, of infringement or misappropriation of their intellectual property rights arising from such customer's usage of our products or services. To date, payments related to these indemnification provisions have been immaterial. For several reasons, including the lack of prior material indemnification claims, we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
 Business 
 Ansys, a corporation formed in 1994, develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including high-tech, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, industrial equipment, materials and chemicals, consumer products, healthcare and construction. Headquartered south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we employed 6,400 and 6,200 people as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs on-premises and/or via the cloud, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing, validation and deployment. We distribute our suite of simulation technologies through direct sales offices in strategic, global locations and a global network of independent resellers and distributors (collectively, channel partners). It is our intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model. We operate and report as one segment. 
 When visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality using Ansys simulation. For more than 50 years, Ansys software has enabled innovators across industries to push the boundaries of product design by using the predictive power of simulation. From sustainable transportation and advanced satellite systems to life-saving medical devices, Ansys powers innovation that drives human advancement. 
 Our strategy of Pervasive Insights seeks to deepen the use of simulation in our core market, to inject simulation throughout the product lifecycle and extend the accessibility to a broader set of users and use cases. Our business has three vectors of growth: 
 More products. Our broad and deep multiphysics portfolio enables us to grow with customers as they use simulation to solve more complex problems across a broad set of industries. 
 More users. Investments in simulation education and user experience simplification has made simulation more accessible to a broader user base. 
 More computations. Larger and more complex simulations drive more computation, requiring customers to use more Ansys licenses to complete their simulations. 
 Through decades of investments in the academic community and enhanced user experiences, our solutions have become accessible and relevant beyond our core "engineering" end user, to reach more users upstream and downstream from our core, which is the product validation process. Our multiphysics solutions enable our customers to address increasingly complex research and development (R D) challenges from the component through the system and mission level of analysis. Our products seamlessly enable access to high performance compute capacity to run simulations, on-premises or in the cloud, which means our customers' R D teams are unencumbered by compute capacity limitations that can hinder R D cycle times. Our investments in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities across our simulation portfolio and technical support services enhance the customer experience, democratize simulation and further next-generation innovation. 
 The engineering simulation software market is strong and growing. The market growth is driven by customers' need for rapid, quality innovation in a cost efficient manner, enabling faster time to market for new products and lower warranty costs. Increasing product complexity is driving sustained demand for simulations. Key industry trends fueling customers' increasing needs for simulation include: 
 Electrification; 
 Autonomy; 
 Connectivity; 
 The industrial internet of things; and 
 Sustainability, including minimizing waste and physical prototyping, and improving circularity and development time.

Table of Contents 

 We have bee n investing and intend to continue to invest in our portfolio to broaden the range of physics and enable customers to analyze the interactions among physics at the component, system and mission level. Our strategy of Pervasive Insights is aligned with the near-term market growth opportunities and is laying the foundation for a future where simulation can be further democratized to broader classes of end users and end-use cases. In addition, we have and expect to continue to partner with industry leaders to extend simulation into other ecosystems and customer R D workflows. 
 
 We license our technology to businesses in a diverse set of industries, educational institutions and governmental agencies. We believe that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. The software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles which increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. We make many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions. As a result, we believe that our overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. 
 
 We address the competition and price pressure that we face in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products as compared to our competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increasing the capabilities of our existing products; maintaining a diverse industry footprint and focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing our distribution channels. We also evaluate and execute strategic acquisitions to supplement our global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels. 
 
 Synopsys Merger Agreement 
 On January 15, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Synopsys and Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Ansys, with Ansys surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. Our Board of Directors and stockholders have approved the Merger Agreement. If consummated, our common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market and deregistered under the Exchange Act. The completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval under certain applicable antitrust and foreign investment regimes. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2025. 
 The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 16, 2024.

 Overall GAAP and Non-GAAP Results 
 This section includes a discussion of GAAP and non-GAAP results. For reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results, see the section titled "Non-GAAP Results" herein. 
 The 2024 and 2023 period non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items. 
 Our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected the following variances: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Revenue 31.2 13.5 GAAP Operating income 131.4 23.6 Non-GAAP Operating income 76.3 28.3 GAAP Diluted earnings per share 128.1 29.5 Non-GAAP Diluted earnings per share 83.0 33.4

 Our results reflect an increase in revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to growth in subscription lease license, maintenance and perpetual license revenue. We also experienced increased operating expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased personnel and acquisition costs. Acquisition costs primarily consist of costs related to the Merger Agreement with Synopsys. Quarterly dynamics may not be representative of the momentum in our business given the shifting mix of license types and renewal cycles that can be volatile quarter to quarter. This further highlights the importance of measuring our results based on our fiscal year rather than individual quarters. 
 This section also includes a discussion of constant currency results, which we use for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. All constant currency results presented in this Item 2 exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2024 period results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2023 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for the 2024 period. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2024 period reported amounts by the 2024 period currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2023 comparable period reported amounts. 
 Impact of Foreign Currency 
 Our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impacts on our revenue and operating income as a result of the fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar when measured against our foreign currencies based on 2023 period exchange rates are reflected in the table below. Amounts in parenthesis indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations.

 In constant currency, our variances were as follows:

 Other Key Business Metric 
 Annual Contract Value (ACV) is a key performance metric and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. ACV is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Over the life of the contract, ACV equals the total value realized from a customer. ACV is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. ACV is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, GAAP revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following: 
 
 the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus 
 the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plus 
 the annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus 
 the value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts. 
 
 When we refer to the anniversary dates in the definition of ACV above, we are referencing the date of the beginning of the next twelve-month period in a contractually committed multi-year contract. If a contract is three years in duration, with a start date of July 1, 2024, the anniversary dates would be July 1, 2025 and July 1, 2026. We label these anniversary dates as they are contractually committed. While this contract would be up for renewal on July 1, 2027, our ACV performance metric does not assume any contract renewals. Example 1: For purposes of calculating ACV, a 100,000 subscription lease contract or a 100,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2024 June 30, 2025, would each contribute 100,000 to ACV for fiscal year 2024 with no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2025. Example 2: For purposes of calculating ACV, a 300,000 subscription lease contract or a 300,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2024 June 30, 2027, would each contribute 100,000 to ACV in each of fiscal years 2024, 2025 and 2026. There would be no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2027 as each period captures the full annual value upon the anniversary date. Example 3: A perpetual license valued at 200,000 with a contract start date of March 1, 2024 would contribute 200,000 to ACV in fiscal year 2024. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 our ACV was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Actual Constant Currency Actual Actual Constant Currency Amount Amount Amount ACV 540,527 538,963 457,549 82,978 18.1 81,414 17.8

 Recurring ACV includes both subscription lease license and maintenance ACV and excludes perpetual license and service ACV. Our trailing twelve-month recurring ACV, converted from the functional currency to U.S. Dollars at the 2023 period monthly average exchange rates, was as follows: 
 Twelve Months Ended September 30,

 Industry Commentary: 
 During the third quarter of 2024, ACV growth was supported by our core industries of aerospace and defense (A D), high-tech and automotive. Our A D customers increasingly rely on and invest in digital engineering to create autonomous attritable and expendable systems, place satellites for communications and imaging, develop electric vertical take-off and landing and improve sustainability within commercial aviation. Growth in the high-tech industry was driven by customer demand for semiconductor and electronics intelligence solutions that advance 3D-IC chip technology, further system-on-chip complexity in mobile phones, increased chips in automobiles and embedded AI at the edge. The combination of our multiphysics platform, AI/machine learning technologies and cloud and high-performance computing solutions empower our high-tech customers to achieve higher product performance and reliability while reducing development time and cost. Additionally, high-tech customers invest in our products to balance sustainability and carbon neutrality goals with demand for advanced chip design for AI, Cloud, smart phones and other devices. Within the automotive industry, customers continue to invest in our software to reduce development time and cost across the entire electrified power system. As automakers face the challenges of new regulations, stalled customer demand and profitability pressures, they are forced to diversify their electrification line-up and bolster development of hybrid electric vehicles. 
 Geographic Trends: 
 The following table presents our geographic revenue variances using actual and constant currency rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Actual Constant Currency Actual Constant Currency Americas 40.4 40.4 20.7 20.7 EMEA 12.7 10.7 4.7 3.9 Asia-Pacific 33.2 35.1 9.1 13.2 Total 31.2 31.2 13.5 14.4 
 The value and duration of multi-year subscription lease contracts executed during the period significantly impact the recognition of revenue. As a result, revenue may fluctuate, particularly on a quarterly basis, due to the timing of such contracts, relative differences in duration of long-term contracts from quarter to quarter and changes in the mix of license types sold compared to the prior year. Large swings in revenue growth rates are not necessarily indicative of customers' software usage changes or cash flows during the periods presented. To drive growth, we continue to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across our geographic regions, including sales hiring, pipeline building, productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities. 
 Use of Estimates: 
 The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to contract revenue, standalone selling prices of our products and services, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, operating lease assets and liabilities, fair values of stock awards, deferred compensation, income taxes, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation reserves, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience, market experience, estimated future cash flows and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 31.2 in reported and constant currency compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Subscription lease license revenue increased 87.6 , or 87.4 in constant currency, with substantially all of the increase attributable to incremental sales to our existing customers. The reported 90.7 million increase in subscription lease license revenue was attributable to a 76.8 million increase in value from multi-year licenses and a 13.9 million increase in value from annual licenses. Maintenance revenue growth of 10.3 , or 10.5 in constant currency, is correlated with previous license sales and is driven substantially by our existing customer base. The reported 28.6 million growth in maintenance revenue was attributable to a 29.3 million increase in maintenance associated with lease licenses, partially offset by a 0.7 million decrease in maintenance associated with perpetual sales. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived from new sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 40.4 , or 39.9 in constant currency, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Driving the increase in perpetual license revenue was a 49.5 increase in average deal size, partially offset by a 9.1 decrease in the volume of deals. 
 We continue to experience strong demand from our customers for contracts that often include longer-term, subscription leases involving a larger number of our software products. These arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price. The upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger transactions can result in significant subscription lease revenue volatility. Software products, across a large variety of applications and industries, are increasingly distributed in software-as-a-service, cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is time-based rather than perpetual. This preference could result in a shift from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses, such as subscription leases, over the long term. 
 With respect to revenue, on average for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. Dollar was 0.1 weaker, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Amounts in parenthesis indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations.

 Deferred Revenue and Backlog: 
 Deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements. The deferred revenue on our condensed consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable agreements. Our backlog represents deferred revenue associated with installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and committed contracts with start dates beyond the end of the current period . Our deferred revenue and backlog as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following: 
 Balance at September 30, 2024 (in thousands) Total Current Long-Term Deferred revenue 451,338 427,188 24,150 Backlog 1,012,459 475,604 536,855 Total 1,463,797 902,792 561,005

 Software Licenses: The increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to increased third-party royalties of 2.3 million. 
 Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to acquired intangible assets related to our business combinations. 
 The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in the cost of sales.

 Selling, General and Administrative: The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following: 
 Increased salaries and incentive compensation of 13.7 million. 
 Increased acquisition costs of 12.1 million due to costs related to the Merger Agreement with Synopsys. 
 Increased stock-based compensation of 11.2 million. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to make targeted investments in our global sales and marketing organizations and our global business infrastructure to enhance and support our revenue-generating activities. 
 Research and Development: The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following: 
 Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related expenses of 6.0 million. 
 Increased stock-based compensation of 3.0 million. 
 We have traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and expect to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of our broad portfolio of simulation software products. 
 Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income : Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.3 million as compared to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased as a result of a higher invested cash balance, a higher interest rate environment and the related increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances. 
 Other (Expense) Income, net: Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.3 million as compared to other income of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other (expense) income consisted primarily of net foreign currency losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and net foreign currency gains during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Provision: Our income before income tax provision, income tax provision and effective tax rates were as follows:

Table of Contents 

 The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was a result of an increase in U.S. federal tax expense on foreign earnings and an increase in non-deductible expenses related to business combinations. 
 When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period, the effective tax rates for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were favorably impacted by the FDII deduction and research and development credits.

 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 13.5 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, or 14.4 in constant currency. Subscription lease license revenue increased 31.4 , or 32.3 in constant currency, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with substantially all of the increase attributable to incremental sales to our existing customers. The reported 121.2 million increase in lease license revenue was attributable to a 106.7 million increase in value from multi-year licenses and a 14.5 million increase in value from annual licenses. Maintenance revenue growth of 8.5 , or 9.5 in constant currency, is correlated with previous license sales and is driven substantially by our existing customer base. The reported 69.4 million growth in maintenance revenue was attributable to a 82.9 million increase in maintenance associated with lease licenses, partially offset by a 13.5 million decrease in maintenance associated with perpetual sales. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived from new sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 6.4 , or 6.9 in constant currency, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Driving the increase in perpetual license revenue was a 24.0 increase in average deal size, partially offset by a 17.6 decrease in the volume of deals. 
 With respect to revenue, on average for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. Dollar was 2.0 stronger, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Software Licenses: The increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to increased third-party royalties of 3.3 million. 
 Amortization: The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to acquired intangible assets related to our business combinations. 
 Maintenance and Service: The decrease in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following: 
 Decreased third-party technical support of 3.2 million. 
 Decreased other headcount-related costs of 1.6 million. 
 The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue, partially offset by the increase in the cost of sales.

 Selling, General and Administrative: The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following: 
 Increased acquisition costs of 34.7 million due to costs related to the Merger Agreement with Synopsys. 
 Increased salaries and incentive compensation of 30.2 million. 
 Increased stock-based compensation of 28.0 million. 
 Increased information technology (IT) maintenance software hosting costs of 3.1 million. 
 Research and Development: The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following: 
 Increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of 15.2 million. 
 Increased stock-based compensation of 10.6 million. 
 The impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of 10.5 million for the nine months ended 
 September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Income: Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.5 million as compared to 12.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income increased as a result of a higher invested cash balance, a higher interest rate environment and the related increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances. 
 Interest Expense: Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.9 million as compared to 34.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased as a result of a higher interest rate environment. 
 Other Expense, net: Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 million as compared to other expense of 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense consisted primarily of net foreign currency losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and losses on equity investments and net foreign currency losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in benefits related to stock-based compensation and an increase in non-deductible expenses related to business combinations . 
 When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period, the effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the FDII deduction and research and development credits, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible compensation.

 We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results. 
 While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below: 
 Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Stock-based compensation expense . We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our Board of Directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results.

 Expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. We also incur other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. These costs are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. We exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results. 
 Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we re-evaluate and update this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below: GAAP Reporting Measure Non-GAAP Reporting Measure Gross Profit Non-GAAP Gross Profit Gross Profit Margin Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin Operating Income Non-GAAP Operating Income Operating Profit Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit Margin Net Income Non-GAAP Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 Constant currency. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures detailed above, we use constant currency results for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2024 period results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2023 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for the 2024 period. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2024 period reported amounts by the 2024 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2023 comparable period reported amounts. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.

 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments 
 Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and time deposits. The following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 In general, it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts. Substantially all of the pre-2018 earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post-2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible low-taxed income tax expense. These taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. Unrecognized provisions for taxes on indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries would not be significant. 
 The amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Amount Net cash provided by operating activities 537,767 484,400 53,367 11.0 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was a result of increased customer receipts driven primarily by ACV growth and increased interest income, partially offset by increased payments related to higher operating expenses and increased income tax payments, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Amount Net cash used in investing activities (86,030) (220,166) 134,136 60.9 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 134.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays of 196.2 million, partially offset by increased purchases of short-term investments of 48.6 million and capital expenditures of 15.7 million. We currently plan capital spending of 40.0 million to 50.0 million during fiscal year 2024 as compared to the 25.3 million that was spent in fiscal year 2023. The level of spending will depend on various factors, including the growth of the business and general economic conditions.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Amount Net cash used in financing activities (76,470) (232,600) 156,130 67.1 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased stock repurchases of 196.5 million, partially offset by increased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of 23.2 million and decreased proceeds from shares issued for stock-based compensation of 15.6 million. 
 Other Cash Flow Information 
 On June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the 2022 Credit Agreement) with PNC Bank, National Association as administrative agent, swing line lender, and an L/C issuer, the lenders party thereto, and the other L/C issuers party thereto. The 2022 Credit Agreement refinanced our previous credit agreements in their entirety. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a 755.0 million unsecured term loan facility and a 500.0 million unsecured revolving loan facility. Terms used in this description of the 2022 Credit Agreement with initial capital letters that are not otherwise defined herein are as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our term loan was 754.1 million, with no principal payments due in the next twelve months. Borrowings under the term loan and revolving loan facilities accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500 , (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate, and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00 . The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available). 
 On September 29, 2023, the 2022 Credit Agreement was amended to provide for an interest rate adjustment (Sustainability Rate Adjustment) based upon the achievement of certain environmental, social and governance key performance indicators (KPIs). The Sustainability Rate Adjustment range is +/- 0.05 and will be adjusted annually based on the KPIs of the preceding year. 
 The rate in effect for the fourth quarter of 2024 under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 5.53 . 
 We previously entered into operating lease commitments, primarily for our domestic and international offices. The commitments related to these operating leases is 124.5 million, of which 28.2 million is due in the next twelve months. 
 There have been no share repurchases in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 650 thousand shares were repurchased at an average price of 302.34 per share, with a total cost of 196.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, 1.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program. 
 We continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business; acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies; and make payments on our outstanding debt balances. Any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, debt financing or the issuance of additional securities. 
 We believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, together with cash generated from operations and access to our 500.0 million revolving loan facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements and contractual obligations through at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. However, future disruptions in the capital markets could make financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 Contractual and Other Obligations 
 On December 5, 2023, we entered into an agreement to make a strategic equity investment in Humanetics in the amount of 300.0 million, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals among other customary closing conditions. As a result of our interactions with regulators, the parties mutually agreed to terminate the investment agreement in July 2024.

 There were no other material changes to our significant contractual and other obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those previously reported within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, January 1, 2024. No events or circumstances changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that would indicate that the fair values of our reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are below their carrying amounts. 
 No significant changes have occurred to our critical accounting estimates as previously reported within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. As we operate in international regions, a portion of our revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations are denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities, including the use of derivative instruments. 
 With respect to revenue, on average for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. Dollar was 0.1 weaker, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. With respect to revenue, on average for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. Dollar was 2.0 stronger, when measured against our foreign currencies, than for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Amounts in parenthesis indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations. (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Japanese Yen (1,153) (12,111) South Korean Won (635) (2,904) Taiwan Dollar (228) (1,069) British Pound 658 1,312 Euro 1,719 1,823 Other (228) (627) Total 133 (13,576) 
 
 The impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of 0.4 million and 10.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 A hypothetical 10 strengthening in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have decreased our revenue by 23.8 million and 66.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and decreased our operating income by 10.7 million and 24.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 The most meaningful currency impacts on revenue and operating income are typically attributable to U.S. Dollar exchange rate changes against the Euro and Japanese Yen. Historical exchange rates for these currency pairs are reflected in the charts below: 
 Period-End Exchange Rates As of EUR/USD USD/JPY September 30, 2024 1.11 144 December 31, 2023 1.10 141 September 30, 2023 1.06 149 
 Average Exchange Rates Three Months Ended EUR/USD USD/JPY September 30, 2024 1.10 149 September 30, 2023 1.09 145 
 Average Exchange Rates Nine Months Ended EUR/USD USD/JPY September 30, 2024 1.09 151 September 30, 2023 1.08 138 
 
 Interest Rate Risk . Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the interest expense that is incurred from our outstanding borrowings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income was 13.3 million and 36.5 million, respectively, and interest expense was 12.3 million and 36.9 million, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and time deposits. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates on these holdings could have a 13.0 million impact on our financial results. 
 Our outstanding term loan borrowings of 755.0 million as of September 30, 2024 accrue interest at a rate that is based on the Term SOFR plus an applicable margin or at the base rate plus an applicable margin, at our election. The base rate is the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus 0.500 , (ii) the PNC Bank, National Association prime rate, and (iii) Daily Simple SOFR plus an adjustment for SOFR plus 1.00 . The applicable margin for the borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of (1) a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated net leverage ratio and (2) a pricing level determined by our public debt rating (if available). 
 On September 29, 2023, the 2022 Credit Agreement was amended to provide for an interest rate adjustment (Sustainability Rate Adjustment) based upon the achievement of certain environmental, social and governance key performance indicators (KPIs). The Sustainability Rate Adjustment range is +/- 0.05 and will be adjusted annually based on the KPIs of the preceding year. 
 Because interest rates applicable to the outstanding borrowings are variable, we are exposed to interest rate risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affects our interest expense. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in cash flows of 7.7 million over the next twelve months, based on outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024. 
 No other material change has occurred in our market risk subsequent to December 31, 2023.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. 
 We believe, based on our knowledge, that the financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this report. We are committed to both a sound internal control environment and to good corporate governance. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 From time to time, we review the disclosure controls and procedures, and may periodically make changes to enhance their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 
 Changes in Internal Control . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
