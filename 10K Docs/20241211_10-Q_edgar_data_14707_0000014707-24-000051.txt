 Retail stores The Company generates revenue from retail sales where control is transferred and revenue is recognized at the point of sale. Retail sales are recorded net of estimated returns and exclude sales tax. The Company records a returns reserve and a corresponding return asset for expected returns of merchandise. Retail sales to members of the Company s loyalty programs, including the Famously You Rewards program, include performance obligations: the sale of merchandise and the delivery of points that may be converted to savings certificates and redeemed for future purchases. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price. The stand-alone selling price for the points is estimated using the retail value of the merchandise earned, adjusted for estimated breakage based upon historical redemption patterns. The revenue associated with the initial merchandise purchased is recognized immediately and the value assigned to the points is deferred until the points are redeemed, forfeited or expired. E-commerce The Company generates revenue from sales on websites maintained by the Company that are shipped from the Company s distribution centers or retail stores directly to the consumer, or picked up directly by the consumer from the Company s stores e-commerce Company websites sales from the Company s wholesale customers websites that are fulfilled on a drop-ship basis e-commerce wholesale drop ship and other e-commerce sales wholesale e-commerce ), collectively referred to as "e-commerce".

Landed wholesale Landed sales are wholesale sales in which the Company obtains title to the footwear from the overseas suppliers and maintains title until the merchandise is shipped to the customer from the Company s warehouses. Many customers purchasing footwear on a landed basis arrange their own transportation of merchandise and, with limited exceptions, control is transferred at the time of shipment. Landed sales generally carry a higher profit rate than first-cost wholesale sales as a result of the brand equity associated with the product along with the additional customs, warehousing and logistics services provided to customers and the risks associated with inventory ownership. First-cost wholesale First-cost sales are wholesale sales in which the Company purchases merchandise from an international factory that manufactures the product and subsequently sells to a customer at an overseas port. Many of the customers then import this product into the United States. Revenue is recognized at the time the merchandise is delivered to the customer s designated freight forwarder and control is transferred to the customer.

 of base salary and of compensation received under the Company s annual incentive plan. The deferrals are held in a separate trust, which has been established by the Company to administer the Deferred Compensation Plan. The assets of the trust are subject to the claims of the Company s creditors in the event that the Company becomes insolvent. Consequently, the trust qualifies as a grantor trust for income tax purposes (i.e., a Rabbi Trust ). The liabilities of the Deferred Compensation Plan are presented in other accrued expenses and the assets held by the trust are classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the Deferred Compensation Plan assets and liabilities are charged to selling and administrative expenses. The fair value is based on unadjusted quoted market prices for the funds in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency (Level 1). Non-Qualified Restoration Plan Assets and Liabilities In 2023, the Company adopted a non-qualified restoration deferred compensation plan (the Restoration Plan for the benefit of certain members of executive management. The Restoration Plan provides an incremental retirement benefit to key executives whose contributions to qualified retirement plans are limited by Internal Revenue Service annual compensation maximums. The investment funds offered to the participants generally correspond to the funds offered in the Company s 401(k) plan. The initial contribution to the Restoration Plan was funded in January 2024 and contributions are expected to continue on an annual basis. The plan assets and liabilities will fluctuate with the returns on the investment funds. The deferrals are held in a separate trust, which has been established by the Company to administer the Restoration Plan. The assets of the trust are subject to the claims of the Company s creditors in the event that the Company becomes insolvent. Consequently, the trust qualifies as a grantor trust for income tax purposes (i.e., a Rabbi Trust ). The liabilities of the Restoration Plan are presented in other accrued expenses and the assets held by the trust are classified within prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the Restoration Plan assets and liabilities are charged to selling and administrative expenses. The fair value is based on unadjusted quoted market prices for the funds in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency (Level 1). Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan with deferred amounts valued as if invested in the Company s common stock through the use of phantom stock units PSUs ). Under the plan, each participating director s account is credited with the number of PSUs equal to the number of shares of the Company s common stock that the participant could purchase or receive with the amount of the deferred compensation, based upon the average of the high and low prices of the Company s common stock on the last trading day of the fiscal quarter when the cash compensation was earned. Dividend equivalents are paid on PSUs at the same rate as dividends on the Company s common stock and are reinvested in additional PSUs at the next fiscal quarter-end. The liabilities of the plan are based on the fair value of the outstanding PSUs and are presented in other accrued expenses (current portion) or other liabilities in the

Additional information related to RSUs for non-employee directors is disclosed in Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at November 2, 2024, October 28, 2023 and February 3, 2024.

Factors the Company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset, or a negative industry or economic trend. When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the aforementioned factors, impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method. Certain factors, such as estimated store sales and expenses, used for this nonrecurring fair value measurement are considered Level 3 inputs as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement . Long-lived assets held and used with carrying amounts of million and million at November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively, were assessed for indicators of impairment. This assessment

The fair values of the borrowings under revolving credit agreement of million and million as of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively, approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of the borrowings (Level 1). and for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The Company s consolidated effective tax rates were and for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 reflects discrete tax benefits of million related to the Company s share-based compensation, compared to discrete tax benefits of million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. As of November 2, 2024, deferred taxes have been provided on the accumulated unremitted earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries that are not subject to United States income tax, beyond the amounts recorded for the one-time transition tax for the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative international earnings, as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company periodically evaluates its international investment opportunities and plans, as well as its international working capital needs, to determine the level of investment required and, accordingly, determines the level of international earnings that is considered indefinitely reinvested. Based upon that evaluation, earnings of the Company s international subsidiaries that are not otherwise subject to United States taxation are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly, deferred taxes have not been provided. If changes occur in future investment opportunities and plans, those changes will be reflected when known and may result in providing residual United States deferred taxes on unremitted international earnings.

 million. The Company has recovered a portion of these expenditures from insurers and other third parties. The reserve for the anticipated future remediation activities at November 2, 2024 is million, of which million is recorded within other liabilities and million is recorded within other accrued expenses. Of the total million reserve, million is for off-site remediation and million is for on-site remediation. The liability for the on-site remediation was discounted at . On an undiscounted basis, the on-site remediation liability would be million as of November 2, 2024. The Company expects to spend approximately million in 2024, million in each of the following four years and million in the aggregate thereafter related to the on-site remediation. Other Various federal and state authorities have identified the Company as a potentially responsible party for remediation at certain other sites. However, the Company does not currently believe that its liability for such sites, if any, would be material. The Company continues to evaluate its remediation plans in conjunction with its environmental consultants and records its best estimate of remediation liabilities. However, future actions and the associated costs are subject to oversight and approval of various governmental authorities. Accordingly, the ultimate costs may vary, and it is possible costs may exceed the recorded amounts. Litigation The Company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such ordinary course of business proceedings and litigation currently pending is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial position. Legal costs associated with litigation are generally expensed as incurred.

 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Business Overview We are a global footwear company that operates retail stores and e-commerce websites, and designs, develops, sources, manufactures and distributes footwear for people of all ages. Our mission is to inspire people to feel great...feet first. We offer retailers and consumers a diversified portfolio of leading footwear brands. Outfitted in our brands, customers can step confidently into every aspect of their lives. As both a retailer and a wholesaler, we have a perspective on the marketplace that enables us to serve consumers from different vantage points. We believe our diversified business model provides us with synergies by spanning consumer segments, categories and distribution channels. A combination of thoughtful planning and rigorous execution is key to our success in optimizing our business and portfolio of brands. Known Trends Impacting Our Business Based on the current macroeconomic environment and our recent operating results, we believe the following trends may continue to impact our business and operating results: Macroeconomic Environment Macroeconomic factors, including, among others, inflation, elevated interest rates, increased real estate costs and higher consumer debt levels continued to impact consumer discretionary spending and our financial results during the first nine months of 2024. We continued to experience lighter consumer traffic in our retail stores during the third quarter, resulting in lower net sales. While we believe that the structural changes we have implemented in the last few years, as well as our diversified model and operational discipline, enable the Company to drive value in a variety of market conditions, changes in macro-level consumer spending trends may continue to adversely impact our financial results in the future. We believe our focus on cost control and our commitment to execute our clearly defined strategic initiatives have positioned us for sustainable, long-term growth. Liquidity Our liquidity position remains strong, with 33.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and excess availability on our revolving credit agreement of 252.1 million as of November 2, 2024. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, borrowings on our revolving credit agreement increased by 53.8 million to 238.5 million, primarily driven by 65.5 million of our common stock repurchases under our share repurchase programs. While our interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2024 will continue to be negatively impacted by the elevated interest rates, we expect to reduce the borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to mitigate the impact of the high interest rate environment. Financial Highlights Highlights of our consolidated and segment results for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

 Metrics Used in the Evaluation of Our Business The following are a few key metrics by which we evaluate our business, identify trends and make strategic decisions: Comparable sales The comparable sales metric is a metric commonly used in the retail industry to evaluate the revenue generated for stores that have been open for more than a year, though other retailers may calculate the metric differently. Management uses the comparable sales metric as a measure of an individual store s success to determine whether it is performing in line with expectations. Our comparable sales metric is a daily-weighted calculation for the period, which includes sales for stores that have been open for at least 13 months. In addition, in order to be included in the comparable sales metric, a store must be open in the current period as well as the corresponding day(s) of the comparable retail calendar in the prior year. Accordingly, closed stores are excluded from the comparable sales metric for each day of the closure. Relocated stores are treated as new stores and therefore excluded from the calculation. E-commerce sales for those websites that function as an extension of a retail chain are included in the comparable sales calculation. In fiscal years with 53 weeks (e.g. 2023), the 53 rd week of comparable sales is included in the calculation. In the following year (e.g. 2024), the prior fiscal year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. We believe the comparable sales metric is useful to shareholders and investors in assessing our retail sales performance of existing locations with comparable prior year sales, separate from the impact of store openings or store closures. Sales per square foot The sales per square foot metric is commonly used in the retail industry to calculate the efficiency of sales based upon the square footage in a store. Management uses the sales per square foot metric as a measure of an individual store s success to determine whether it is performing in line with expectations. The sales per square foot metric is calculated by dividing total retail store sales, excluding e-commerce sales and the retail operations of our joint venture in China, by the total square footage of the retail store base in North America at the end of each month of the respective period. Dire ct-to-consumer sales Direct-to-consumer sales includes sales from our retail stores, our company-owned websites and sales through our customers websites that we fulfill on a drop-ship basis. While we take an omni-channel approach to reach consumers, we believe that our direct-to-consumer channels reinforce the image of our brands and strengthens our connection with the end consumer. In addition, direct-to-consumer sales generally result in a higher gross margin for the Company as compared to wholesale sales. As a result, management monitors trends in direct-to-consumer sales as a percentage of our Brand Portfolio segment and total consolidated net sales. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Following are the consolidated results and the results by segment: CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

The decrease in the Famous

Table of Contents 
 Footwear segment net sales was partially offset by an increase in net sales in the Brand Portfolio segment of 2.2 million, or 0.7 during the third quarter of 2024, with our brands with premium positioning generally outperforming our other brands. We also experienced growth in sales from our owned e-commerce businesses, which increased approximately 2.1 on a consolidated basis compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our direct-to-consumer sales represented approximately 72 of consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 73 in the third quarter of 2023. We remain focused on maximizing the vertical opportunity between the Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments, with LifeStride, Dr. Scholl s, Naturalizer and Blowfish Malibu representing four of Famous Footwear s top 20 best-selling footwear brands during the quarter. Net sales decreased 36.7 million, or 1.7 , to 2,083.5 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 2,120.2 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. Net sales for our Brand Portfolio segment decreased 21.6 million, or 2.3 during the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to the nine months ended October 28, 2023. In addition, net sales for our Famous Footwear segment decreased 15.1 million, or 1.2 , in the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to the nine months ended October 28, 2023, due in part to a decline in customer traffic in our retail stores. Comparable sales decreased 0.9 in the nine months ended November 2, 2024. On a consolidated basis, our direct-to-consumer sales were approximately 72 of total net sales for both the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and the nine months ended October 28, 2023. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 13.4 million, or 3.9 , to 327.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 340.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 44.1 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 44.7 for the third quarter of 2023, driven by a decrease in the gross margin of our Famous Footwear segment, partially offset by a slight increase in the gross margin of our Brand Portfolio segment. The lower gross margin at Famous Footwear reflects an increase in promotional activity and higher clearance sales, partially due to aged boot inventory. In addition, we experienced higher freight costs, due in part to the higher mix of e-commerce sales. Gross profit decreased 10.3 million, or 1.1 , to 946.9 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 957.2 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 45.5 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 45.1 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, driven by an increase in the gross margin of our Brand Portfolio segment, reflecting higher merchandise margins and a higher mix of retail sales, including e-commerce sales from our owned brands and sales from our branded retail stores, both of which have higher gross margins than our wholesale sales. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the gross margin in the Famous Footwear segment, driven by higher levels of promotional activity and clearance sales. We classify certain warehousing, distribution, sourcing and other inventory procurement costs in selling and administrative expenses. Accordingly, our gross profit and selling and administrative expense rates, as a percentage of net sales, may not be comparable to other companies. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses decreased 5.0 million, or 1.8 , to 268.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 273.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was driven by lower expenses for our cash and share-based incentive compensation. The decrease was partially offset by higher facilities costs, reflecting higher depreciation associated with the investment in Famous Footwear store renovations and upgrades and higher store rent expense as leases are renewed, higher salary and benefit expenses, higher information technology and consulting expense associated with the implementation of our cloud-based ERP platform, and higher marketing expenses driven by marketing investments for certain brands. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to 36.2 for the third quarter of 2024, from 35.9 for the third quarter of 2023. Selling and administrative expenses increased 13.7 million, or 1.7 , to 803.3 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 789.6 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher salary and benefit expenses, higher marketing expenses, higher information technology and consulting expense associated with the implementation of our cloud-based ERP platform, and higher facilities costs, partially offset by lower expenses for our cash and share-based incentive compensation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to 38.6 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, from 37.2 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023.

 Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net Restructuring and other special charges of 1.6 million for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024 were associated with restructuring costs, primarily severance. Restructuring and other special charges of 2.3 million and 3.9 million for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, were associated with expense reduction initiatives. Refer to Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these charges. Operating Earnings Operating earnings decreased 7.7 million to 56.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 64.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, reflecting the factors described above. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings were 7.7 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.5 for the third quarter of 2023. Operating earnings decreased 21.7 million to 142.0 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 163.7 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, primarily reflecting lower net sales. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings were 6.8 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 7.7 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased 1.6 million, or 35.1 , to 2.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense, net decreased 5.3 million, or 34.2 , to 10.0 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 15.3 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The decreases primarily reflect lower average borrowings on the revolving credit facility. The interest on our revolving credit facility is based on a variable rate, which adversely impacts our interest expense in the current elevated interest rate environment. While our interest expense for the remainder of 2024 will continue to be adversely impacted by the elevated interest rates, we expect to reduce the borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to mitigate the impact of the high interest rate environment. Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased 1.6 million to an immaterial amount for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, and decreased 2.5 million, or 52.7 , to 2.2 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 4.7 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The decreases are primarily attributable to higher amortization of the actuarial loss related to our pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. These decreases were partially offset by non-operating income associated with logistics services provided to a third party, which the Company began providing in the second half of 2023. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate can vary considerably from period to period, depending on a number of factors. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 23.6 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.5 for the third quarter of 2023. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 23.8 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 24.1 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The lower effective tax rate was driven by discrete tax benefits, primarily related to share-based compensation, of approximately 1.1 million in the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 0.9 million in the nine months ended October 28, 2023. In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules, designed to ensure large corporations are taxed at a minimum rate of 15 in all countries of operation. The OECD continues to release guidance and countries are implementing legislation to adopt the rules, which became effective on January 1, 2024. The United States has not yet enacted legislation implementing Pillar Two. We are continuing to evaluate the Pillar Two rules and their potential impact on future periods, but we do not expect the rules to have a material impact on our tax provision or effective tax rate. Net Earnings Attributable to Caleres, Inc. Net earnings attributable to Caleres, Inc. were 41.4 million and 102.3 million for the third quarter and nine months ended November 2, 2024, respectively, compared to 46.9 million and 115.6 million for the third quarter and nine months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, as a result of the factors described above.

The shift resulted in one less week of our high-volume back-to-school selling season in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of last year. Comparable sales, which reflects the calendar shift, increased 2.5 . We experienced a strong start to the third quarter of 2024 with the back-to-school selling season, but sales moderated as the quarter progressed. During the third quarter of 2024, we experienced soft demand in our boots category due in part to the unseasonably warm fall weather. Our sales were also adversely impacted by late product receipts of certain athletic footwear during the important back-to-school selling season. Our kids category, which is a key differentiator for Famous Footwear, continues to outperform many of our categories. Penetration of the kids category to total Famous Footwear sales was 25 in the third quarter of 2024. Our athletics category performed well during the quarter, driven by several of our key brands. We also experienced growth in our e-commerce sales and higher penetration of this channel in the third quarter of 2024. Penetration of e-commerce sales increased to approximately 15 of net sales in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 13 in the third quarter of 2023. We opened six stores and closed 10 stores during the third quarter of 2024, resulting in 851 stores and total square footage of 5.6 million at the end of the quarter, compared to 862 stores and total square footage of 5.7 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Sales to members of our customer loyalty program, Famously You Rewards, continue to account for a majority of the segment s sales, with approximately 74 of our net sales made to program members in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 77 in the third quarter of 2023. Net sales of 1,198.1 million in the nine months ended November 2, 2024 decreased 15.1 million, or 1.2 , compared to the nine months ended October 28, 2023, primarily due to the same factors described for the third quarter. Comparable sales declined 0.9 in the nine months ended November 2, 2024, driven by a decline in customer traffic in our retail stores. Athletics and casual continue to be our top-selling categories, while sales in the fashion categories, including boots, were weaker. We remain focused on maximizing the vertical opportunity between the Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments, with Dr. Scholl s, LifeStride, Naturalizer and Blowfish Malibu representing four of Famous Footwear s top 20 best-selling footwear brands for the nine months ended November 2, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, we opened 12 stores and closed 21 stores. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, we also converted 11 stores to the new FLAIR (Famous Localized and Immersive Retail) concept, which has been successful in driving sales growth, and ended the quarter with a total of 32 FLAIR stores.

 Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 15.0 million, or 7.5 , to 183.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 198.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 42.9 for the third quarter of 2024, from 44.2 for the third quarter of 2023 as a result of higher levels of promotional activity. Higher levels of clearance selling, due in part to aged boot inventory, also negatively impacted our gross profit margin during the quarter. In addition, we experienced higher freight costs, due in part to the higher mix of e-commerce sales. Gross profit decreased 15.2 million, or 2.8 , to 534.2 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 549.4 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, driven by lower net sales. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 44.6 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 45.3 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, driven by higher levels of promotional activity and clearance sales. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased 3.0 million, or 2.0 , to 154.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 151.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher facilities costs, including depreciation expense associated with the investments in the FLAIR store concept, and higher salary and benefits expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to 36.0 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 33.6 for the third quarter of 2023. Selling and administrative expenses increased 9.4 million, or 2.1 , to 453.2 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 443.8 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The increase was driven by higher facilities costs and higher salary and benefits expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to 37.9 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 36.6 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net Restructuring and other special charges of 0.2 million for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024 were associated with restructuring costs, primarily severance. Restructuring and other special charges of 1.2 million and 1.3 million for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, were associated with expense reduction initiatives. Refer to Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these charges. Operating Earnings Operating earnings decreased 17.0 million to 29.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 46.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the factors described above. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings declined to 6.9 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 10.4 for the third quarter of 2023. Operating earnings decreased 23.5 million to 80.8 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 104.3 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings were 6.7 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 8.6 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023.

 (1) Direct-to-consumer includes sales of our retail stores and e-commerce sites and sales through our customers websites that we fulfill on a drop-ship basis. Net Sales Net sales of 322.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased 2.1 million, or 0.7 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, we continued to see strong demand for new products, with momentum in fashion sneakers and certain casual footwear categories, including slingbacks, Mary Janes and ballet flats. We also had sales growth in our wide-shaft and tall boot categories, while our short boot category experienced soft demand. Our brands with premium positioning generally outperformed our other brands in the quarter. During the third quarter of 2024, we opened one store in the United States, resulting in a total of 62 stores, consistent with the third quarter of 2023. In addition, we continued to expand our retail store presence in East Asia in the third quarter of 2024 by opening six new Sam Edelman stores and one new Naturalizer store. During the third quarter of 2024, we closed one Naturalizer store, resulting in a total of 49 stores at the end of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 34 stores at the end of the third quarter of 2023. There were also 113 international branded stores owned and operated by third parties through franchise agreements at November 2, 2024, compared to 97 international branded stores at October 28, 2023. Net sales decreased 21.6 million, or 2.3 , to 925.6 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 947.2 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The sales decline was driven by lower wholesale sales, partially offset by solid growth in the e-commerce business. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by operational disruptions related to the launch of our new cloud-based ERP system in the second quarter of 2024, primarily while our e-commerce and drop-ship platforms were either offline or ramping up after the launch. As we progressed through the second quarter, the development of several key operational reports was delayed, resulting in a lack of visibility to certain data and tools we rely on to manage the wholesale business. The decrease in net sales also reflects softer demand associated with the challenging macroeconomic environment and competitive retail landscape.

As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 44.4 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 43.1 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023 reflecting higher merchandise margins and a higher mix of retail sales, including e-commerce sales from our owned brands and sales from our branded retail stores, both of which have higher gross margins than our wholesale sales.

As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to 33.6 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 31.5 for the nine months ended October 28, 2023, reflecting deleveraging of expenses over lower net sales.

 The net sales elimination of 10.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 is 1.7 million, or 18.7 , higher than the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an increase in product sold from our Brand Portfolio segment to Famous Footwear. The net sales elimination of 40.3 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 is 0.1 million higher than the nine months ended October 28, 2023. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 13.4 million, to 8.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 21.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease reflects lower expenses for our cash and share-based incentive compensation, partially offset by higher information technology and consulting expenses associated with the implementation of our cloud-based ERP platform. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 8.0 million, to 39.1 million for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 47.1 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. The decrease primarily reflects the same factors described for the quarter. Restructuring and other special charges of 0.3 million for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024 were associated with restructuring costs, primarily severance, at our corporate headquarters. Restructuring and other special charges of 0.3 million and 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, were associated with expense reduction initiatives at our corporate headquarters. Refer to Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these charges. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Borrowings As further discussed in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company maintains a revolving credit facility for working capital needs that matures on October 5, 2026. The aggregate amount available under the revolving credit facility is up to 500.0 million, subject to borrowing base restrictions, and may be increased by up to 250.0 million. Interest on the borrowings is at variable rates based on the SOFR, or the prime rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a spread. Total debt obligations of 238.5 million at November 2, 2024 increased 16.5 million, from 222.0 million at October 28, 2023, and 56.5 million, from 182.0 million at February 3, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we used our revolving credit facility to repurchase 50.0 million of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1.6 million to 2.9 million, compared to 4.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, reflecting lower average borrowings and a lower weighted-average interest rate on our revolving credit facility. At November 2, 2024, we had 238.5 million in borrowings and 9.4 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Total borrowing availability was 252.1 million at November 2, 2024. We were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under the Credit Agreement as of November 2, 2024.

 A smaller increase in trade accounts payable during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, Lower net earnings in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023; partially offset by A smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023. We are in the process of a multi-year cloud-based ERP implementation and launched the wholesale and finance modules in the second quarter of 2024. These modules were funded with cash provided by operating activities. Cash used for investing activities was 2.9 million higher for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, reflecting higher capital expenditures, due in part to the Famous Footwear store remodels to the new FLAIR concept. We expect purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software to be between 50 million and 55 million in 2024, compared to 49.6 million in 2023. Cash used for financing activities was 96.3 million lower for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 as compared to the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, primarily due to net borrowings on our revolving credit agreement of 56.5 million in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, compared to net repayments of 85.5 million in the comparable period in 2023. In addition, we repurchased 65.0 million of our common stock under our share repurchase program during the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 17.4 million in repurchases during the nine months ended October 28, 2023. In conjunction with the share repurchases during the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024, we incurred excise taxes of 0.5 million. The excise taxes payable are presented in other accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The associated share repurchases presented as acquisition of treasury stock on the condensed consolidated cash flow for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 2, 2024 excludes the excise taxes payable. Refer to Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. A summary of key financial data and ratios at the dates indicated is as follows: 

November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 February 3, 2024 Working capital millions) (1) 63.9 (5.0) 46.0 Current ratio (2) 1.08:1 0.99:1 1.06:1 Debt-to-capital ratio (3) 28.2 29.9 24.3 

 (1) Working capital has been computed as total current assets less total current liabilities. (2) The current ratio has been computed by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. (3) The debt-to-capital ratio has been computed by dividing the borrowings under our revolving credit agreement by total capitalization. Total capitalization is defined as total debt and total equity . 
 Working capital at November 2, 2024 was 63.9 million, which was an improvement of 68.9 million from October 28, 2023 and a 17.9 million increase from February 3, 2024. The increase in working capital from October 28, 2023 primarily reflects higher inventory, lower accrued expenses and higher accounts receivable, partially offset by higher borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. The increase in working capital from February 3, 2024 primarily reflects higher inventory and higher accounts receivable, partially offset by higher borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our current ratio was 1.08:1 as of November 2, 2024, compared to 0.99:1 at October 28, 2023 and 1.06:1 at February 3, 2024. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 28.2 as of November 2, 2024, compared to 29.9 as of October 28, 2023 and 24.3 at February 3, 2024. We declared and paid dividends of 0.07 per share in the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023. The declaration and payment of any future dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. However, we presently expect that dividends will continue to be paid. We have various contractual or other obligations, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, operating lease commitments, one-time transition tax for the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and obligations for our supplemental executive

 retirement plan and other postretirement benefits. We also have purchase obligations to purchase inventory, assets and other goods and services. We believe our operating cash flows are sufficient to meet our material cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures It is the Chief Executive Officer s and Chief Financial Officer s ultimate responsibility to ensure we maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures include mandatory communication of material events, automated accounting processing and reporting, management review of monthly, quarterly and annual results, an established system of internal controls and ongoing monitoring by our internal auditors. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact there are resource constraints, and the benefits of 

 36

 controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that their objectives are achieved. As of November 2, 2024, management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Based on the evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such ordinary course of business proceedings and litigation currently pending will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Information regarding Legal Proceedings is set forth within Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and incorporated by reference herein. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes that have occurred related to our risk factors since the end of the most recent fiscal year. For further information, see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024. We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business. Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, accounting, reporting, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, marketing, sales and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. With the continued growth in e-commerce direct-to-consumer sales, any system disruption may result in an adverse impact to our operations. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, we fail to realize the expected return on our technology investment, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment, reduced efficiency in our operations, or delays in reporting our financial results to investors, or we may be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are in the process of a multi-year ERP implementation, which has required significant financial and human capital resources. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties as we implement the new ERP system. The implementation has been and may continue to be more difficult, costly and time-consuming than anticipated, and it is possible that the system will not yield the expected benefits. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies related to the new ERP system may materially and adversely impact our business operations, including our ability to process orders, manage our inventory, ship products to our customers, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or perform other business functions.
