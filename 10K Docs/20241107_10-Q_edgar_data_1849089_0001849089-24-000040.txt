However, the Company anticipates that it could take time to invest substantially all of the capital it expects to raise in a geographically diverse manner due to general market conditions, the time necessary to identify, evaluate, structure, negotiate and close suitable investments in private middle market companies, and the potential for allocations to other affiliated investment vehicles which focus their investments on a specific region. As a result, at any point in time, the Company may have a disproportionate amount of investments in certain Target Regions, and there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve geographic diversification across all Target Regions.

 The significant unobservable input used in the income approach of fair value measurement of the Company s investments is the discount rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. Increases (decreases) in the discount rate would result in a decrease (increase) in the fair value estimate of the investment. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates are the following factors: risk of default, rating of the investment and comparable investments, and call provisions. 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach of fair value measurement of the Company s investments are the market multiples of EBITDA or revenue of the comparable guideline public companies. The Company selects a population of public companies for each investment with similar operations and attributes of the portfolio company. Using these guideline public company data, a range of multiples of enterprise value to EBITDA or revenue is calculated. The Company selects percentages from the range of multiples for purposes of determining the portfolio company s estimated enterprise value based on such multiple and generally the latest twelve months EBITDA or revenue of the portfolio company (or other meaningful measure). Increases (decreases) in the multiple will result in an increase (decrease) in enterprise value, resulting in an increase (decrease) in the fair value estimate of the investment.

The Company maintained effective control over the security because it is entitled and obligated to repurchase the security before its maturity.

No Management Fee is charged on committed but undrawn capital commitments. 
 We define a Liquidity Event as the earliest to occur of: (1) a quotation or listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange, including an initial public offering or (2) a Sale Transaction. A Sale Transaction means (a) the sale of all or substantially all of our capital stock or assets to, or another liquidity event with, another entity or (b) a transaction or series of transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or sale of stock in each case for consideration of either cash and/or publicly listed securities of the acquirer.

This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred Income-Based Fee of and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred Income-Based Fee of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, remained payable as shown on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
 The second part of the incentive fee, the Capital Gains Fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or at the time of a Liquidity Event). The Capital Gains Fee is equal to of (1) realized capital gains less (2) realized capital losses, less unrealized capital losses on a cumulative basis from inception through the day before the Liquidity Event, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee. 
 Prior to a Liquidity Event, the Capital Gains Fee equals: 
 of cumulative realized capital gains less all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year (or upon a Liquidity Event), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

 of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 If a Liquidity Event occurs on a date other than the first day of a fiscal year, the Capital Gains Fee will be calculated as of the day before the Liquidity Event, with such Capital Gains Fee paid to the Adviser annually following the end of the fiscal year in which the Liquidity Event occurred. Solely for purposes of calculating the Capital Gains Fee after a Liquidity Event, the Company will be deemed to have previously paid a Capital Gains Fee prior to a Liquidity Event equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid Capital Gains Fee for all periods prior to a Liquidity Event by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) by (y) . 
 Each year, the Capital Gains Fee is calculated net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee for all prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a Capital Gains Fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a Capital Gains Fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the Capital Gains Fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement exceed the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), including Section 205 thereof. 
 For the purpose of computing the Capital Gains Fee, the calculation methodology looks through derivative financial instruments or swaps as if we owned the reference assets directly. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no Capital Gains Fees incurred. 
 Administration Agreement 
 Pursuant to the administration agreement between the Company and LS Administration, LLC (the Administration Agreement ), LS Administration, LLC (the Administrator furnishes the Company with office space, office services, and equipment. Under the Administration Agreement, our Administrator performs or oversees the performance of our required administrative services, which include providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology, internal audit, and investor relations, and loan agency services (including any third party service providers related to the foregoing) and being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, our Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and disseminating reports to our stockholders, assessing our internal controls under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount that reimburses our Administrator for its costs and expenses. Such payments include the Company's allocable portion of (i) the expenses incurred by our Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, (ii) the compensation paid to our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs, and (iii) the cost of providing managerial assistance upon request to portfolio companies. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon days written notice to the other party. Additionally, we ultimately bear the costs of any sub-administration agreements that our Administrator may enter into. Our Administrator reserves the right to waive all or part of any reimbursements due from us at its sole discretion. 
 The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our Administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it will be entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Administrator s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for us. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred and , respectively, in fees under the Administrative Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred

 and , respectively, in fees under the Administrative Agreement. These fees are included in administrative service fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities included in prepaid administrative services cost which will be amortized over remainder of the year ended December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were unpaid and included in administrative services fee payable in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. No administrative services fee was charged to the Company prior to the Company s commencement of operations. 
 Additionally, pursuant to a sub-administration agreement with SS C Technologies, Inc. SS C ), SS C performs certain of the Company s required administrative services, which include providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, investor relations and technology, being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to the Company s stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. SS C is also reimbursed for certain expenses it incurs on our behalf. 
 Our Administrator and Adviser have entered into staffing agreements with affiliates of Lafayette Square pursuant to which such Lafayette Square affiliates agree to provide our Administrator and Adviser with access to certain legal, operations, financial, compliance, accounting, internal audit (in their role of performing our Sarbanes-Oxley Act internal control assessment), clerical and administrative personnel. 
 Affiliated transactions 
 The Adviser s investment allocation policy seeks to ensure allocation of investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time between the Company and other funds or investment vehicles managed by the Adviser or its affiliates. It is expected that the Company may have overlapping investment strategies with such affiliated funds and/or investment vehicles, but there are prohibitions under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with such affiliates without prior approval of the directors who are not interested persons, and in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. As a result, the Company, the Adviser and certain of their affiliates applied for, and have been granted, exemptive relief by the SEC for the Company to co-invest with other funds or investment vehicles managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Company s organizational documents and investment strategy as well as applicable laws and regulations and the Adviser s fiduciary duties. As a result of such exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of such other affiliated entities that avail themselves of such exemptive relief and that have an investment objective similar to the Company. In addition, any transaction fees (including break-up or commitment fees, but excluding transaction fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act, as applicable, which are expected to be retained by the Adviser, to the extent permitted by applicable law) received in connection with a co-investment transaction among the Company and its affiliated entities will be distributed to the participating entities (including the Company) on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such transaction. 
 Due to Affiliate 
 The Administrator pays for certain unaffiliated third-party expenses incurred by the Company. These expenses are not marked-up and represent the same amount the Company would have paid had the Company paid the expenses directly. After the commencement of operations these expenses are reimbursed on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were included in the Due to Affiliate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities for reimbursable expenses paid by the Administrator on behalf of the Company. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 On December 30, 2021, the Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the "Expense Support Agreement") with the Adviser. The Adviser may elect to pay certain Company expenses on the Company s behalf (each, an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees of the Company. Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates.

 Distributions 
 
 Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The Company elected to be taxed as a RIC under the Code for its taxable year ending December 31, 2023, and for future taxable years. As a RIC, the Company is required to distribute dividends each tax year as a RIC to its stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of its investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, in order to be eligible for tax benefits allowed to a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The Company anticipates paying out as a distribution all or substantially all of those amounts. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board and is based on management s estimate of the Company s annual taxable income. Net realized capital gains, if any, may be distributed to stockholders or retained for reinvestment. 
 The Company has adopted the DRIP that provides for the automatic reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors, unless a stockholder elects to opt out of the DRIP. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The Company reserves the right to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the DRIP, whether the shares are trading at a price per share at or above NAV. NAV is determined as of the latest available quarter end before such distribution. However, the Company reserves the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with the implementation of the DRIP. In the event the price per share is trading at a discount to NAV, the Company intends to purchase shares in the open market rather than issue new shares.

 At September 30, 2024, the Company determined a partial valuation allowance of the Company's gross deferred tax asset was required. The Company s assessment considered, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the associated risk that operating loss and capital loss carryforwards are limited or are likely to expire unused, and unrealized gains and losses on investments. Through the consideration of these factors, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company s net deferred tax asset would not be realized in full. As a result, the Company recorded a partial valuation allowance with respect to its gross deferred tax asset for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. From time to time, the Company may modify its estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability and/or asset balances and any applicable valuation allowance as new information becomes available. Modifications to the Company s estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability and/or asset balances and any applicable valuation allowance, changes in generally accepted accounting principles or related guidance or interpretations thereof, limitations imposed on or expirations of the Company s net operating losses and capital loss carryovers (if any) and changes in applicable tax law could result in increases or decreases in the Company s NAV per share, which could be material.

 The following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. References to we, us, our, and the Company, means Lafayette Square USA, Inc., unless otherwise specified. The discussion and analysis contained in this section refers to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 The Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company focused on lending to middle market businesses while offering them significant managerial assistance to strengthen their workforce, with the goal of creating and preserving jobs and stimulating economic growth in each of ten Target Regions across the United States. The Company believes that demand for capital investment and managerial assistance is particularly acute among middle market companies headquartered in overlooked places, given that we believe business development companies and other capital providers primarily focus on investments in businesses located in high income jurisdictions. We believe inflationary pressures and the increasing employee benefits gap exacerbate this demand, enabling us to utilize our investment approach to select favorable risk-adjusted return opportunities. 
 
 Our investment objective is to generate favorable risk-adjusted returns, including current income and capital appreciation, principally from investments in "non-sponsored" middle market businesses that are primarily domiciled, headquartered and/or have a significant operating presence in each of the Target Regions, with a goal to invest at least 5 of its assets in each region over time. We define middle market businesses as companies having annual revenues between 10 million and 1 billion and annual EBITDA of between 10 million and 100 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We expect to invest primarily in first and second lien loans and, to a lesser extent, in subordinated and mezzanine loans and equity and equity-like securities, including common stock, preferred stock, and warrants. 
 
 We will primarily focus our origination efforts on non-sponsored businesses, which we define as companies substantially owned by people rather than funds or financial institutions where we can establish a direct lending relationship without the involvement or backing of a traditional buyout fund sponsor. We believe this focus will enable us to source investments through a less competitive lending process, allowing us to achieve favorable economic and structural terms for our investments. We intend to complement this investment strategy with robust risk management practices and rigorous ongoing portfolio monitoring. For a discussion of the risks inherent in our portfolio investments, please see the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors. While we are generally industry agnostic with respect to our focus on investment sectors, we tend to primarily invest in the business services, franchising, technology telecommunications, transportation logistics, and healthcare sectors. In addition, we opportunistically look for exposures in the real-estate industry (including with companies that manage real estate and with real estate-related projects that advance our 2030 goals as further described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K )) and the solar power industry (including with companies working to strategically enact energy transition plans). 
 We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company on February 19, 2021. Prior to the Effective Date, we elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we were taxed as a corporation for the period from February 19, 2021 (date of inception) through December 31, 2022. The Company intends to elect to be treated, and qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a result, the company generally does not expect to be subject to U.S. federal income taxes. However, there is no guarantee that the company will qualify to make such an election for any taxable year. Prior to the Effective Date and to our election to be regulated as a BDC, we completed a conversion under which Lafayette Square USA, Inc. (then known as Lafayette Square Empire BDC, Inc.) succeeded to the business of Lafayette Square Empire BDC, LLC, and the sole member of Lafayette Square Empire BDC, LLC became the stockholder of Lafayette Square Empire BDC, Inc. On May 16, 2022, Lafayette Square Empire BDC, Inc. filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to change its corporate name from Lafayette Square Empire BDC, Inc. to Lafayette Square USA, Inc., effective May 16, 2022. As a BDC, we must comply with certain regulatory requirements. When we qualify as a RIC there will be additional 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 regulatory requirements we must comply with as well. See Item 1. Business Regulation as a Business Development Company and Item1. Business Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations . 
 We are managed by our Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Lafayette Square. The Adviser is a limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser oversees the management of the Company s activities and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to the Company s portfolio. 
 
 We generally expect to hold our investments until maturity or until such investments are refinanced by the portfolio company. From time to time, we may invest in loans with other lenders, or club loans, and may serve as agent in connection with any such loans. In our capacity as agent, we act as the servicer of the loan. We may also participate in loans in the broadly syndicated loan market. Our debt investments in our portfolio companies typically have principal amounts of up to 50 million, bear interest at floating rates of interest tied to a widely available risk-free rate such as the U.S. Prime Rate or SOFR, and generally are not guaranteed by the federal government or otherwise. The debt instruments in which we invest are typically not rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if they were, they would be rated below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moody s Investors Service, lower than BBB by Fitch Ratings or lower than BBB by Standard Poor s Ratings Services). Under the guidelines established by these rating agencies, such ratings are an indication of such debt instruments having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Debt instruments that are rated below investment grade are sometimes referred to as high yield bonds or junk bonds. 
 
 The Company currently has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Lafayette Square SBIC, LP SBIC LP and Lafayette Square SSBIC, LP ("SSBIC LP"), that each have an SBIC license from the SBA. Each SBIC license provides the Company an incremental source of long-term capital by permitting it to issue up to 175 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures, for a total of 350 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures available to the SBIC funds under common control of the Company, subject to the SBA s approval. These debentures have maturities of ten years and have fixed interest rates tied to the U.S. 10 Year Treasury rate, which are generally lower than comparable bank and other forms of debt. 
 
 We believe that investment capital does not flow to working class communities and to lower middle market companies. As (i) reflected in the SEC s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval database, only 6,000 BDC portfolio companies out of a total of 240,000 BDC portfolio companies have revenues less than 1 billion annually and (ii) reflected in research reports by FactSet and Raymond James, 80 of BDC portfolio companies are headquartered in high-income areas and 50 of companies in which BDCs invest are held by more than one BDC, suggesting that working class communities are overlooked by traditional capital markets investors. U.S. private companies, which are typically smaller than public companies, experience average annual employee turnover of 48.2 . This instability contributes to marginal economic prospects for working class employees. For example, an estimated 64 of U.S. workers live paycheck to paycheck, and 70 of working class employees do not enjoy healthcare or retirement benefits. As described in our 2023 Form 10-K, we aim to promote public welfare and community development in working class communities by deploying at least 51 of our invested capital to borrowers (i) located in and/or with a majority of operations in Working Class Areas 1 or (ii) that provide Substantial Employment 2 to LMI individuals. In addition to such targeted investing, we seek to improve the retention, well-being, and productivity of employees by connecting our portfolio companies with third-party service providers that deliver workplace benefits and/or advisory support ("Third-Party Solution Providers") through Lafayette Square's services platform, Worker Solutions (such platform is described in more detail in our 2023 Form 10-K). This platform is consistent with the mandate that BDCs offer significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies upon request, and we believe these curated services have the potential to (i) positively affect employee well-being and (ii) enhance the risk-adjusted financial returns of the portfolio companies (including by increasing employee retention, morale and productivity). 
 
 In line with the aims set forth above, and as described in more detail in our 2023 Form 10-K, we have set 2030 goals to (1) increase employment opportunities by assisting our portfolio companies in creating and/or retaining 100,000 working class 
 
 1 Working Class Areas refers to low- and moderate- income LMI areas, Empowerment Zones, as defined in the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Act of 1993, as amended Empowerment Zones ), Opportunity Zones, as defined in the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 Opportunity Zones ), and/or areas targeted by a government entity for redevelopment or to revitalize or stabilize designated disaster areas. LMI is defined under applicable CRA regulation as (i) an individual, family or household, if their income is less than 80 of the Area Median Income as reported by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council at https://www.ffiec.gov/Medianincome.htm [ffiec.gov] (or such other industry recognized source as may be determined by the Adviser) and (ii) a census tract, if it is identified as low-to-moderate income by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council at https://geomap.ffiec.gov/ffiecgeomap/ (or such other industry recognized source as may be determined by the Adviser). Throughout this Form 10-Q, we may use the terms "LMI", "underserved" and "working class" interchangeably. 
 2 Substantial Employment means more than 50 of the portfolio company s workforce, measured by W-2 forms or 1099 forms filed by workers with the Internal Revenue Service.

 jobs, and 150,000 jobs overall, (2) provide significant managerial assistance to small and middle-market companies in which we invest by incentivizing at least 50 of our borrowers to adopt Worker Solutions and (3) encourage economic growth in working class communities by investing at least 50 of our assets in companies which are either located in working class communities or are substantial employers of working class people.) To measure our progress towards these goals and understand the demographic data of employees in our portfolio companies, we track the locations of our portfolio companies and the LMI status of their employees. For these purposes, we rely on feedback from our portfolio companies to obtain information about the status and well-being of their employees. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information provided to us by our portfolio companies, and the metrics used by different portfolio companies to calculate such information varies significantly. However, based on our analysis, we believe that deployment of our capital and the utilization of services provided by Worker Solutions by our portfolio companies can improve the lives of their employees as reflected through a variety of statistical measures. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 60.8 percent of our portfolio (and 61.4 of the transactions where we were lead agent) were invested in borrowers who are either located in Working Class Areas or are Substantial Employers of LMI people, with 6,992 LMI individuals employed out of a total of 17,378 employees. 3 In addition, with respect to engagement by our portfolio companies with our Third-Party Solution Providers and/or recommended human resources ("HR") policy changes, as of September 30, 2024, 37 of the transactions where we were lead agent (28 of our overall Portfolio Companies) had adopted our Third-Party Solution Providers and/or recommended HR policy changes (for a total of six Third-Party Solution Providers and six HR policy changes deployed. Of the 17,378 workers employed through our portfolio companies, 2,480 workers have participated in third-party solutions and/or covered by qualifying policy changes. Overall, a total of 4,545 workers have access to improved benefits through third-party solutions or HR policy changes. 
 
 By comparison, as of September 30, 2023, 48.7 percent of our portfolio (and 62.9 of the transactions where we were lead agent) were invested in borrowers who were either located in Working Class Areas or were Substantial Employers of LMI people, with 2,081 LMI individuals employed out of a total of 9,363 employees. In addition, with respect to engagement by our portfolio companies with our Third-Party Solution Providers, as of September 30, 2023, 54.5 of the transactions where we were lead agent (and 42.2 of our overall Portfolio Companies) had adopted our Third-Party Solution Providers (for a total of five Third-Party Solution Providers), with 52 workers served and a total of 2,163 workers with access to services. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, among our portfolio companies that have adopted Third-Party Solution Provider services, 118 total workers across two portfolio companies have cumulatively saved 15,449 in emergency savings, 142 workers across two portfolio companies combined have prevented an estimated 100,846 in debt 4 through small-dollar, zero-interest loans, 43 workers from one portfolio company are building their credit scores through monthly rent reporting, and seven workers from one portfolio company have cumulatively participated in 42 one-on-one financial coaching sessions to better their financial wellness. Additionally, two portfolio companies have each adopted three recommended HR policy changes to expand benefits access and participation for employees, serving 2,264 workers combined. 
 
 The Company rewards portfolio companies with an interest rate stepdown when they adopt services from Third-Party Solution Providers and/or implement policy changes to existing workplace benefits (defined as Qualifying Human Capital Investments that we believe will enhance employee well-being and improve retention. As of September 30, 2024, we have rewarded a combined total of 187,403 to portfolio companies through interest rate stepdown savings for their adoption of Third-Party Solution Providers and/or implementation of HR policy changes. 
 
 Over time, we believe our portfolio companies' uptake of Third-Party Solution Providers, in combination with our capital, will contribute to an improvement in below metrics, shown over the past two years:

 In addition to supporting human capital investments and outcomes at our portfolio companies, Worker Solutions has provided managerial assistance to companies and projects affiliated with our portfolio companies. This effort includes providing credit building through rent reporting services to 1 residential property where 433 tenants have enrolled in credit building services out of a total of 436 residents (99.3 uptake). Of the 433 residents who are participating in the rent reporting program, 10 of these residents newly established a credit file or became "credit visible" to the consumer credit bureaus. These newly credit visible residents posted an average credit score of 683 at the end of the recent reporting period. Prior to participating in the rent reporting program, most residents (423) had previously established a credit file or who were already "credit visible". Since enrollment in the rent reporting program, these residents have posted an average credit score improvement of 24 points, an average credit score of 647; overall, 55 of these residents improved their credit score, with 5 of the overall resident group increasing their credit score above 660--typically considered the subprime-prime threshold. 
 
 Key Components of Operations 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity may vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments we hold and capital gains, if any, on our investments. We generally expect our debt investments to have a stated term of five to eight years and typically to bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as the SOFR. Interest on these debt 
 
 5 Turnover rates are calculated by dividing the total terminations for the period by the average number of employees who worked during or received pay for the same period. National turnover data is based on private employee data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and Current Employment Statistics Survey. 
 6 Change Since Initial Investment Average is taken as the average of all portfolio companies' change in turnover, medical care participation or retirement participation since the BDC's initial investment, otherwise known as deal close date, with the portfolio company. Where data wasn't available in the same quarter as the initial investment, the next available quarter's data was used. Based on 9 of 29 portfolio companies' current human capital data made available to Lafayette Square. 
 7 Medical Care Benefits are plans that provide services or payments for services rendered in the hospital or by a qualified medical care provider. Participation is calculated from the unrounded percentage of workers who participate in the plan. 71 employees from portfolio companies who did not provide medical care benefits data to the Company were not included in this calculation. National average is private industry from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - National Compensation Survey. 
 8 Retirement Benefit plans includes defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans. Participation is calculated from the unrounded percentage of workers who participate in the plan. The national average is private industry from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - National Compensation Survey. 
 9 National median income 1-year data is from the U.S. Census Bureau - American Community Survey. This is the most recent data available as of Oct 2024. Median family income is used to calculate individual LMI per CRA guidelines. The metric is included at the national level to serve as a similar but not exact comparison.

 investments are generally payable quarterly. In some instances, we may receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Expenses 
 We expect our primary annual operating expenses to include advisory fees and the reimbursement of expenses under our investment advisory and management agreement between the Company and the Adviser, dated April 26, 2021 and approved by the Board for renewal on June 4, 2024 (and as may be further amended, the Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement, respectively. We also bear other expenses, which include: 
 our initial organization costs and operating costs incurred prior to the filing of our election to be regulated as a BDC (in connection with our formation and the initial closing of the private offering of shares of our Common Stock); 
 the costs associated with our private offering and any subsequent offerings of our securities; 
 calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of third-party valuation services); 
 out-of-pocket expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of its investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies, dead deal or broken deal expenses and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 
 certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid by us; 
 administration fees payable under the Administration Agreement and related expenses; 
 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 
 the allocated costs incurred in connection with providing services to employees of portfolio companies (of the type described in Item I. Business Investment Strategy and/or managerial assistance (including any services offered to portfolio companies) to those portfolio companies that request it (whether such costs are incurred by the Adviser or Administrator or through payments to third party service providers); 
 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; 
 transfer agent and custodial fees; 
 costs of hedging; 
 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 
 federal and state registration fees; 
 any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; 
 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our Common Stock and other securities; 
 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 
 independent director fees and expenses; 
 costs of preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining books and records, costs of preparing tax returns, costs of compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and attestation and costs of filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation or review of the foregoing;

 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 
 the costs of specialty and custom software expense for monitoring risk, compliance and overall investments; 
 our fidelity bond; 
 any necessary insurance premiums; 
 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification payments or amounts payable pursuant to any agreement to provide indemnification entered into by the Company); 
 direct fees and expenses associated with independent audits, agency, consulting and legal costs; costs of winding up; 
 and other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the compensation paid to our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. We also include the cost of providing managerial assistance upon request to portfolio companies, and reimbursements of third-party expenses incurred by the Administrator in carrying out its administrative services, including providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology, internal audit, investor relations, and loan agency services (including any internal and third party service providers and/or software solutions related to the foregoing), and being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, our Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, our internal control assessment under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase proportionally when our asset value declines. 
 Leverage 
 The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a number of factors, including cash on-hand available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. Prior to the Small Business Credit Availability Act being signed into law, a BDC generally was not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing it has an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200 . The Small Business Credit Availability Act, signed into law on March 23, 2018, contains a provision that grants a BDC the option, subject to certain conditions and disclosure obligations, to reduce the asset coverage requirement to 150 . In April 2021, our Board and initial stockholder approved the reduced asset coverage ratio. 
 On September 30, 2024, we received an exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of SBIC LP that is guaranteed by the SBA from the 150 asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. With this exemptive relief, we will have increased capacity to fund up to 175.0 million (the maximum amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures an SBIC may currently have outstanding once certain conditions have been met) of investments with SBA-guaranteed debentures in addition to being able to fund investments with borrowings up to the maximum amount of debt that the 150 asset coverage ratio limitation would allow us to incur.

 (4) To calculate net debt, we include debt that ranks both senior and equally with to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk. 
 Ongoing monitoring and risk management of each asset is conducted by the Adviser's Portfolio Monitoring team under the supervision of our Chief Risk Officer. The Portfolio Monitoring team is separate and distinct from the Adviser's investment team, and has as its primary responsibilities to: 
 formally monitor portfolio companies post-investment on an ongoing basis; 
 perform quarterly valuations of all assets in partnership with third-party valuation agent(s); 
 maintain and update internal and external asset ratings; 
 oversee BDC-level monitoring; and 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 lead amendment, work out, and restructurings processes. 
 Portfolio Monitoring monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to investments in each portfolio company. Portfolio Monitoring has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and variants from approved budgets and internal projections; 
 assessment of performance relative to business plan and key operating metrics and compliance with financial covenants; 
 assessment of performance relative to industry benchmarks or portfolio comparables, if any; 
 attendance at and participation in board meetings and lender calls; and 
 review of monthly, quarterly and annual audited financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 Investment Rating Description 1 Involves the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since the time of origination or acquisition are generally favorable which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 2 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2. 3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased since origination or acquisition. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however loan payments are generally not past due. 4 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due) 5 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 The following table shows the distribution of the Company s investments on the 1 to 5 internal risk rating scale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 We value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Advisor and our valuation policy and process . 
 The valuation process is a multi-step endeavor, which includes the following: 
 the quarterly valuation process commences with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated by the investment professionals of the Advisor responsible for the monitoring of the portfolio investment; 
 the Advisor s Valuation Committee reviews the valuations provided by the independent third-party valuation firm (other than immaterial investments, which are internally valued quarterly unless otherwise deemed appropriate by the Valuation Committee, and subsequently corroborated by an independent valuation firm on an annual basis) and develops a valuation recommendation; 
 the Adviser's Valuation Committee reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with our valuation policy and compares such valuations to the independent valuation firms' valuation ranges to ensure the Adviser's valuations are reasonable; 
 the Adviser's Valuation Committee then determines fair value marks for each of our portfolio investments; and 
 the Board and Audit Committee periodically reviews the valuation process and provides oversight in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 The Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company considers its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. 
 The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below. 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets/exchanges for identical investments as of the reporting date. 
 Level 2 - Pricing inputs are observable inputs including, but not limited to, prices quoted for similar assets or liabilities in active markets/exchanges or prices quoted for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. 
 Level 3 - Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include activities where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into determination of fair value require significant management judgment and estimation. 
 Investments 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Investment and Related Investment Income 
 The Company records interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company records amortized or accreted discounts or premiums as interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line interest method, as applicable, and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Dividend income, which represents dividends from equity investments and distributions from subsidiaries, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that the Company expect to collect such amount. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to us in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. Origination fees received are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan, any unamortized origination fees are recorded as investment income. The Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees, covenant waiver fees and loan amendment fees, and are recorded as investment income when earned. 
 Non-accrual loans 
 A loan can be left on accrual status during the period the Company is pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal and interest, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected, for possible placement on non-accrual status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid, and, in management s judgment, payments are likely to remain current. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company intends to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for the tax year ended December 31, 2023, as well as maintain such election in future taxable years. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will qualify to make such an election for any taxable year. In order to qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to its stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. As a RIC, the Company would intend to make the requisite distributions to its 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to its stockholders. The Company may be subject to regular federal and state corporate income tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that the Company elects to recognize upon RIC election or when recognized over the next five taxable years. 
 The Company is subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on its undistributed income, unless it timely distributes (or is deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of (1) 98 of ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the amount by which capital gains exceeds capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any income and gains recognized, but not distributed, from the previous years. While the Company intends to distribute any income and capital gains to avoid imposition of this 4 U.S. federal excise tax, it may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, the Company will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which it does not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. Our Adviser agreed to serve as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of our Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under our Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period consist of the base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance.

Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to our shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar quarter (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), we will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by us will be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) our net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) our net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above).

 Capital Resources and Borrowings 
 As a BDC, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to shares of our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 , subject to receipt of certain approvals and compliance with certain disclosure requirements, immediately after each such issuance. Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act reduces the asset coverage requirements applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. In April 2021, our Board and initial stockholder approved the reduced asset coverage ratio. The reduced asset coverage requirements permit us to increase the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to us from 200 to 150 . As defined in the 1940 Act, asset coverage of 150 means that for every 100 of net assets we hold, we may raise 200 from borrowing and issuing senior securities as compared to 100 from borrowing and issuing senior securities for every 100 of net assets under a 200 asset coverage requirement. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. As of

Table of Contents 

In order to finance certain investment transactions, the Company may, from time to time, enter into repurchase agreements with Macquarie US Trading LLC Macquarie ), whereby the Company sells to Macquarie an investment that it holds and concurrently enters into an agreement to repurchase the same investment (any such obligation, a Repurchase Obligation at an agreed-upon price at a future date, not to exceed 90-days from the date it was sold. 
 
 The Company entered into two repurchase agreements on May 1, 2024 which were collateralized by the Company s term loans to each of Salt Dental Collective (the "Salt Repurchase Obligation") and Med Learning Group, LLC (the "MLG Repurchase Obligation" and together with the Salt Repurchase Obligation, the "May 2024 Repurchase Obligations"). Interest under each of the May 2024 Repurchase Obligations was calculated as (a) the product of the funded amount of the loan and (b) the product of (i) the number of days the loan is outstanding (subject to number of minimum days per the agreement) and (ii) daily fee rate. The Company maintained effective control over the security because it is entitled and obligated to repurchase the security before its maturity. Therefore, the repurchase agreement was treated as a secured borrowing and not a sale. On July 30, 2024 the Company repurchased its obligation under the MLG Repurchase Obligation.

 In addition, as of this Report date, we had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately 90.0 million and 415.6 million, respectively. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by the Adviser s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a term sheet have been issued, and therefore we believe have a strong likelihood of closing. Investment pipeline includes transactions where initial due diligence has begun and/or analysis is in process, but no formal mandate, letter of intent or term sheets have been issued. The consummation of any of the investments in this 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the negotiation, execution, and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, we may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will sell all or any portion of these investments. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 In addition, any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. These hypothetical interest income calculations are based on a model of the settled debt investments in our portfolio, held as of September 30, 2024, and are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on interest income. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 96.6 of investments at fair value (excluding investments on non-accrual, unfunded debt investments and non-bearing equity investments) represent floating-rate investments with a LIBOR or SOFR floor (including investments bearing a prime interest rate contracts) and approximately 3.4 of investments at fair value represent non floating-rate investments. Additionally, our subscription-based credit facility is also subject to a floating interest rate and currently paid on a floating SOFR rates. Interest expense is calculated based on outstanding secured borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and based on the terms of our Subscription Facility. Interest expense on our Subscription Facility is calculated using the stated interest rate as of September 30, 2024, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We continue to finance a portion of our investments with borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may impact significantly our net interest income. 
 We regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled debt investments (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments), and outstanding secured borrowings assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 69 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2024 Basis point increase (decrease) Interest Income Interest Expense Net Interest Income Up 300 basis points 13,586 (9,360) 4,226 Up 200 basis points 9,040 (6,240) 2,800 Up 100 basis points 4,495 (3,120) 1,375 Down 100 basis points (4,495) 3,120 (1,375) Down 200 basis points (8,990) 6,240 (2,750) Down 300 basis points (13,484) 9,360 (4,124) 
 We may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts and credit hedging contracts, such as credit default swaps, in each case, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investment with fixed interest rates.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness and design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level in timely alerting management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of material information about us required to be included in periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published consolidated financial statements. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness as to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
