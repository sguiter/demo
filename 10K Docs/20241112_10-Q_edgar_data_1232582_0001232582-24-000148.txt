 consolidated operating hotel properties, which represent total rooms owned through a ownership interest in Stirling REIT OP, LP Stirling OP ), which was formed by Stirling Hotels Resorts, Inc. Stirling Inc. to acquire and own a diverse portfolio of stabilized income-producing hotels and resorts. See note 2; 
 ownership in OpenKey, Inc. OpenKey with a carrying value of approximately million; and 
 an investment in an entity that owns the Meritage Resort and Spa and the Grand Reserve at the Meritage (the Meritage Investment in Napa, California, with a carrying value of approximately million. 
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, which imposes limitations related to operating hotels. As of September 30, 2024, our operating hotel properties and Stirling OP hotel properties were leased or owned by our wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries that are treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes (collectively, these subsidiaries are referred to as Ashford TRS ). Ashford TRS then engages third-party or affiliated hotel management companies to operate the hotels under management contracts. Hotel operating results related to these properties are included in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 We are advised by Ashford Hospitality Advisors LLC Ashford LLC ), a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., through an advisory agreement. Our operating hotel properties and Stirling OP hotel properties in our consolidated portfolio are currently asset-managed by Ashford LLC. We do not have any employees. All of the services that might be provided by employees are provided to us by Ashford LLC. 
 We do not operate any of our hotel properties directly; instead we contractually engage hotel management companies to operate them for us under management contracts. Remington Lodging Hospitality, LLC Remington Hospitality ), a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., manages of our operating hotel properties and of the Stirling OP hotel properties. Third-party management companies manage the remaining hotel properties. 
 Ashford Inc. also provides other products and services to us or our hotel properties through certain entities in which Ashford Inc. has an ownership interest. These products and services include, but are not limited to, design and construction services, debt placement and related services, audiovisual services, real estate advisory and brokerage services, insurance policies covering general liability, workers compensation and business automobile claims and insurance claims services, hypoallergenic premium rooms, watersport activities, broker-dealer and distribution services, mobile key technology and cash management services. 
 On September 27, 2024, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10. This reverse stock split converted every ten issued and outstanding shares of common stock into one share of common stock. The reverse stock split was effective as of the close of business on October 25, 2024. As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of outstanding shares of common stock was reduced from approximately million shares to approximately million shares on that date. Additionally, the number of outstanding common units, Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP units and Performance LTIP units was reduced from approximately million units to approximately units on that date. All common stock, common units, LTIP units, Performance LTIP units, performance stock units and

 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company has funded million. 
 On December 6, 2023, the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement with Stirling OP, a subsidiary of Stirling Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement, the Company contributed its equity interests, and the associated debt and other obligations, in Residence Inn Manchester, Hampton Inn Buford, SpringHill Suites Buford and Residence Inn Jacksonville to Stirling OP in exchange for million Class I units of Stirling OP. 
 The Company determined the transaction resulted in Ashford Trust becoming the primary beneficiary of Stirling OP in contemplation of: 1) the related party group comprised of (i) Ashford Trust and (ii) the stockholders who have control over election or removal of the board of directors of Stirling Inc. that have power to direct the most significant activities of Stirling OP; and 2) the consideration that substantially all the economics are held by the Company through its equity interest, and substantially all of the activities are performed on the Company s behalf. As a result, Ashford Trust began consolidating Stirling OP as of December 6, 2023 and as such, the properties and debt continue to be reflected on the Company's balance sheet at their historical carrying values. As of September 30, 2024, Ashford Trust remains the primary beneficiary and continues to consolidate Stirling OP. 
 Historical seasonality patterns at some of our hotel properties cause fluctuations in our overall operating results. Consequently, operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 Compound Embedded Debt Derivative Based on certain provisions in the Oaktree Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay an exit fee. Under the applicable accounting guidance, the exit fee is considered an embedded derivative liability that meets the criteria for bifurcation from the debt host. There were other features that were bifurcated, but did not have a material value. The compound embedded debt derivative, consisting of the exit fee and other features which were bifurcated, was initially measured at fair value and the fair value of the embedded debt derivative is estimated at each reporting period.

 or more) to the overall valuation of our derivatives, the derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Transfers of inputs between levels are determined at the end of each reporting period. In determining the fair values of our derivatives at September 30, 2024, the SOFR interest rate forward curve (Level 2 inputs) assumed a downtrend from to for the remaining term of our derivatives. Credit spreads (Level 3 inputs) used in determining the fair values of derivatives assumed an uptrend in nonperformance risk for us and all of our counterparties through the maturity dates. 
 
 million, which was attributed to the compound embedded derivative liability associated with the Oaktree term loan. 
 The compound embedded derivative liability is considered a Level 3 measurement due to the utilization of significant unobservable inputs in the valuation, which were based on with and without valuation models. Based on the terms and provisions of the Oaktree Credit Agreement, with the assistance of a valuation specialist, the Company utilized a risk neutral model to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivative features requiring bifurcation as of the respective issuance dates and as of the September 30, 2024 reporting date. The risk neutral model is designed to utilize market data and the Company s best estimate of the timing and likelihood of the settlement events that are related to the embedded derivative features in order to estimate the fair value of the respective notes with these embedded derivative features. 
 The fair value of the notes with the derivative features is compared to the fair value of a plain vanilla note (excluding the derivative features), which is calculated based on the present value of the future default adjusted expected cash flows. The difference between the two values represents the fair value of the bifurcated derivative features as of each respective valuation date. 
 The key inputs to the valuation models that were utilized to estimate the fair value of the embedded debt derivative are described as follows: 
 the default probability-weighted exit fee and prepayment cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the Oaktree Credit Agreement and the expectation of an acceleration event, including default, of the Company; 
 the risk-free rate of was the discount rate utilized in the valuation and was determined based on reference to market yields for U.S. treasury debt instruments with similar terms; 
 the recovery rate of assumed upon occurrence of a default event was estimated based upon recovery rate data published by credit rating agencies specific to the seniority of the notes; and 
 the probabilities and timing of a default-related acceleration event of were estimated using an annualized probability of default which was implied from the debt issuance proceeds as of the issuance date, and updated utilizing relevant market data including market observed option-adjusted spreads as of September 30, 2024.

 LTIP units, which are issued to certain executives and employees of Ashford LLC as compensation, generally have vesting periods of . Additionally, certain independent members of the board of directors have elected to receive LTIP units as part of their compensation, which are fully vested upon grant. Upon reaching economic parity with common units, each vested LTIP unit can be converted by the holder into common unit which can then be redeemed for cash or, at our election, settled in our common stock. An LTIP unit will achieve parity with the common units upon the sale or deemed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership at a time when our stock is trading at a level in excess of the price it was trading on the date of the LTIP issuance. More specifically, LTIP units will achieve full economic parity with common units in connection with (i) the actual sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership or (ii) the hypothetical sale of such assets, which results from a capital account revaluation, as defined in the partnership agreement, for the operating partnership. 
 The compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company may authorize the issuance of Performance LTIP units to certain executive officers and directors from time to time.

Such repurchases will be outside Stirling Inc. s share repurchase plan and thus will not be subject to the repurchase limits of the share repurchase plan or any early repurchase deduction. 
 Stirling OP does not intend to pay Stirling Advisor any acquisition or other similar fees in connection with making investments.

To the extent contributions made by any of the Parties through December 31, 2023 differed from the amounts owed pursuant to the foregoing, the Parties shall make true up payments to each other to settle the difference. During the first quarter of 2024, the funding requirement was revised based on the aggregate capital raised through Ashford Securities. This resulted in Ashford Trust making a payment of approximately million to Ashford Inc. which resulted in expense of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Ashford Trust has funded approximately million and has a pre-funded balance of that is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

These franchise agreements expire on varying dates between 2025 and 2047. When a franchise term expires, the franchisor has no obligation to renew the franchise. In addition, if we breach the franchise agreement and the franchisor terminates a franchise prior to its expiration date, we may be liable for up to times the average annual fees incurred for that property. 
 
 Management Fees Under hotel management agreements for our hotel properties existing at September 30, 2024, we pay monthly hotel management fees equal to the greater of approximately per hotel (increased annually based on consumer price index adjustments) or of gross revenues, or in some cases to of gross revenues, as well as annual incentive management fees, if applicable. These hotel management agreements expire from 2025 through 2038, with renewal options.

 in legal fees. In September 2024, a settlement was reached to resolve the prevailing party s legal fees in the amount of million. As a result an additional accrual of approximately was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is included in other hotel expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. 
 On December 20, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against one of the Company s hotel management companies in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Contra Costa alleging violations of certain California employment laws, which class action affects hotels owned by subsidiaries of the Company. The court has entered an order granting class certification with respect to: (i) a statewide class of non-exempt employees of our manager who were allegedly deprived of rest breaks as a result of our manager s previous written policy requiring its employees to stay on premises during rest breaks; and (ii) a derivative class of non-exempt former employees of our manager who were not paid for allegedly missed breaks upon separation from employment. Notices to potential class members were sent out on February 2, 2021. Potential class members had until April 4, 2021 to opt out of the class; however, the total number of employees in the class has not been definitively determined and is the subject of continuing discovery. The opt-out period has been extended until such time that discovery has concluded. In May 2023, the trial court requested additional briefing from the parties to determine whether the case should be maintained, dismissed, or the class de-certified. After submission of the briefs, the court requested that the parties submit stipulations for the court to rule upon. On February 13, 2024, the judge ordered the parties to submit additional briefing related to on-site breaks. The Court has ordered the parties to complete a second mediation no later than January 31, 2025. While we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss associated with this litigation, because there remains uncertainty under California law with respect to a significant legal issue, discovery relating to class members continues, and the trial judge retains discretion to award lower penalties than set forth in the applicable California employment laws, we do not believe that any potential loss to the Company is reasonably estimable at this time. As of September 30, 2024, amounts have been accrued. 
 We are also engaged in other legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. To the extent the claims giving rise to these legal proceedings are not covered by insurance, they relate to the following general types of claims:

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 General 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of 68 consolidated operating hotel properties, which represent 17,051 total rooms. One consolidated operating hotel property, which represents 188 total rooms is owned through a 29.3 investment in a consolidated entity. Additionally, our portfolio consists of f our consolidated operating hotel properties, which represent 405 total rooms owned through a 99.0 ownership interest in Stirling OP, which was formed by Stirling Inc. to acquire and own a diverse portfolio of stabilized income-producing hotels and resorts. Currently, all of our hotel properties are located in the United States. 
 Based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions, our current key priorities and financial strategies include, among other things: 
 preserving capital and maintaining significant cash and cash equivalents liquidity; 
 disposition of non-core hotel properties; 
 acquisition of hotel properties, in whole or in part, that we expect will be accretive to our portfolio; 
 pursuing capital market activities and implementing strategies to enhance long-term stockholder value; 
 accessing cost effective capital, including through the issuance of non-traded preferred securities; 
 opportunistically exchanging preferred stock into common stock; 
 implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability and maintain the quality of our assets; 
 implementing effective asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and increase revenues; 
 financing or refinancing hotels on competitive terms; 
 modifying or extending property-level indebtedness; 
 utilizing hedges, derivatives and other strategies to mitigate risks; 
 pursuing opportunistic value-add additions to our hotel portfolio; and 
 making other investments or divestitures that our board of directors deems appropriate. 
 Our current investment strategy is to focus on owning predominantly full-service hotels in the upper upscale segment in domestic markets that have RevPAR generally less than twice the national average. We believe that as supply, demand, and capital market cycles change, we will be able to shift our investment strategy to take advantage of new lodging-related investment opportunities as they may develop. Our board of directors may change our investment strategy at any time without stockholder approval or notice. We will continue to seek ways to benefit from the cyclical nature of the hotel industry.

 Recent Developments 
 The Company continues to work with the lender of the KEYS A and KEYS B loan pools on a consensual transfer of ownership of those hotels to the lender, and the Company anticipates that transfer will occur in the second half of 2024. The original lenders previously transferred the loans to a securitization trust. On March 1, 2024, the Company received notice that the hotel properties securing the KEYS A and KEYS B loan pools have been transferred to a court-appointed receiver. Below is a summary of the hotel properties securing the KEYS Pool A loan and Keys Pool B loan: 
 KEYS A Loan Pool 
 Courtyard Columbus Tipton Lakes Columbus, IN 
 Courtyard Old Town Scottsdale, AZ 
 Residence Inn Hughes Center Las Vegas, NV 
 Residence Inn Phoenix Airport Phoenix, AZ 
 Residence Inn San Jose Newark Newark, CA 
 SpringHill Suites Manhattan Beach Hawthorne, CA 
 SpringHill Suites Plymouth Meeting Plymouth Meeting, PA 
 KEYS B Loan Pool 
 Courtyard Basking Ridge Basking Ridge, NJ 
 Courtyard Newark Silicon Valley Newark, CA 
 Courtyard Oakland Airport Oakland, CA 
 Courtyard Plano Legacy Park Plano, TX 
 Residence Inn Plano Plano, TX 
 47 

SpringHill Suites BWI Airport Baltimore, MD 
 TownePlace Suites Manhattan Beach Hawthorne, CA 
 We derecognized the hotel properties securing the KEYS Pool A and KEYS Pool B loans from our consolidated balance sheet in March 2024, when the receiver took control of the hotel properties, and accordingly recognized a gain of 133.9 million, which is included in gain (loss) on derecognition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations and recorded a contract asset of 378.2 million, which represented the liabilities we expect to be released from upon final resolution with the lenders on the KEYS Pool A and KEYS Pool B mortgage loans in exchange for the transfer of ownership of the respective hotel properties. 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized an additional gain of 11.7 million, which is included in gain (loss) on derecognition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations that increased the contract asset by a corresponding amount. The additional gain primarily represents the additional accrued interest expense recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an additional gain of 11.1 million, which is included in gain (loss) on derecognition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations that increased the contract asset by a corresponding amount. The KEYS Pool A and the KEYS Pool B mortgage loans as well as all accrued and unpaid interest, default charges and late fees will remain liabilities until final resolution with the lenders is concluded, and thus is included in indebtedness associated with hotels in receivership and accrued interest associated with hotels in receivership on our consolidated balance sheets. On July 2, 2024, the Courtyard Plano Legacy Park and the Residence Inn Plano were foreclosed on at a public auction. As a result the contract asset and corresponding indebtedness associated with hotels in receivership and accrued interest associated with hotels in receivership were reduced for the amounts attributable to each hotel. 
 In June 2024, the Company was informed by its lender that the lender intended to exercise remedies for the maturity default on the Ashton Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, which secures the Company s 8.9 million mortgage loan. The Company and the lender agreed to a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which was completed on July 16, 2024. See note 7 . 
 On August 8, 2024, the parties to the Advisory Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Third Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Amendment ). The Amendment extends the outside date for which any sale or disposition of any of the Company s eight hotel properties associated with JPM8 following a JPM8 Event of Default (as such terms are defined in the Advisory Agreement) would be excluded from the numerator of the calculation of the percentage of gross book value of the Company s assets sold or disposed (but, for the avoidance of doubt, included in the denominator of such calculation) for purposes of determining whether a Company Change of Control (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) has occurred, from May 31, 2025 to August 31, 2025. 
 On September 23, 2024, the Company received a written notice from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE that it was not in compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Company s common stock was less than 1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. 
 On September 27, 2024, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10. The purpose of the reverse stock split was to raise the per share trading price of the Company s common stock to regain compliance with the minimum 1.00 continued listing requirement for the listing of the Company s common stock on the NYSE. This reverse stock split converted every ten issued and outstanding shares of common stock into one share of common stock. The reverse stock split was effective as of the close of business on October 25, 2024. As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of outstanding shares of common stock was reduced from approximately 55.2 million shares to approximately 5.5 million shares on that date. Additionally, the number of outstanding common units, LTIP units and Performance LTIP units was reduced from approximately 2.1 million units to approximately 208,000 units on that date. 
 On November 1, 2024, the NYSE notified the Company that it had cured its non-compliance with the NYSE s minimum average closing price per share standard because the average closing price of its common stock was above 1.00 per share on October 31, 2024 and for the consecutive 30 trading-day period ending October 31, 2024. 
 On October 18, 2024, Ashford Inc. entered into a compensatory arrangement (the Compensatory Arrangement with Stephen Zsigray, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer. The Compensatory Arrangement is effective as of July 1, 2024. 
 The Company is not a party to the Compensatory Arrangement and all of Mr. Zsigray s base compensation and employee health and welfare benefits are provided by Ashford Inc. However, in connection with Ashford Inc. s entry into the Compensatory Arrangement with Mr. Zsigray, the board of directors of the Company has agreed to pay Mr. Zsigray a one-time sign on bonus consisting of a 704,110 deferred cash award (the Deferred Cash Award and grant Mr. Zsigray a one-time 
 48 

award of 50,900 shares of restricted common stock of the Company (the Equity Grant ). The Deferred Cash Award is payable (i) 25 in the fourth quarter of 2024; (ii) 50 upon repayment of all amounts owing under the Company s corporate strategic financing with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.; and (iii) 25 on successful completion of a process to review potential value creation strategies for the Company, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company s board of directors. The Equity Grant is eligible to vest in three equal installments on each of July 1, 2025, 2026 and 2027. Payment of the Deferred Cash Award and vesting of the Equity Grant are generally subject to Mr. Zsigray s continued employment through each applicable milestone. 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Oaktree Credit Agreement which, among other items, will reduce the exit fee from 15.0 to 12.5 of the original loan balance through December 15, 2024, provided that the outstanding loan balance has been reduced to 50 million or less by November 15, 2024. As of November 12, 2024, the Oaktree term loan balance has been reduced below 50 million triggering the reduced exit fee under the Oaktree Credit Agreement. 
 On November 7, 2024, the Company refinanced its mortgage loan secured by the Marriott Crystal Gateway Hotel located in Arlington, Virginia, which had a final maturity date in November 2026. The new, non-recourse mortgage loan totals 121.5 million and has a three-year initial term with two one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The mortgage loan is interest only and provides for a floating interest rate of SOFR + 4.86 . The refinancing resulted in approximately 31 million of excess proceeds that was used to pay down the Oaktree term loan. 
 On November 8, 2024, the parties to the Third Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Third Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Second Amendment ). The Second Amendment extends the outside date for which any sale or disposition of any of the Company s Highland loan portfolio and JPM8 hotel properties securing the associated mortgage loans following certain defaults (as described in the Ashford Trust Advisory Agreement), including a maturity default, would be excluded from the numerator of the calculation of the percentage of gross book value of the Company s assets sold or disposed (but, for the avoidance of doubt, included in the denominator of such calculation) for purposes of determining whether a Company Change of Control (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) has occurred, from August 31, 2025 to November 30, 2025. In addition, the Second Amendment places certain limitations on the operations of the Company and Ashford Trust OP should a Potential Company Change of Control (as defined in the Amendment) occur. 
 On November 8, 2024, the Company entered into a 90-day forbearance agreement for its 409.8 million mortgage loan with a final maturity of November 9, 2024 and secured by 17 hotel properties. The Company is in active discussions with the lender regarding a multi-year extension of the mortgage loan, which the Company expects to finalize during the 90-day forbearance period. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Key Indicators of Operating Performance 
 We use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as other financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the operating performance of our individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or business as a whole. We also use these metrics to evaluate the hotels in our portfolio and potential acquisitions to determine each hotel s contribution to cash flow and its potential to provide attractive long-term total returns. These key indicators include: 
 Occupancy Occupancy means the total number of hotel rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available. Occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity. We use occupancy to measure demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. 
 ADR ADR means average daily rate and is calculated by dividing total hotel rooms revenues by total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. We use ADR to assess the pricing levels that we are able to generate. 
 RevPAR RevPAR means revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying ADR by the average daily occupancy. RevPAR is one of the commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR does not include revenues from food and beverage sales or parking, telephone or other non-rooms revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels. We also use RevPAR to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels (comparable hotels represent hotels we have owned for the 
 49 

entire period). RevPAR improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs. RevPAR improvements attributable to increases in ADR are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs, such as management fees and franchise fees. 
 RevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room supplies) and could also result in increased other operating department revenue and expense. Changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not have a substantial effect on variable operating costs. 
 Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the lodging industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our entire business. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a regional and company-wide basis. ADR and RevPAR include only rooms revenue. Rooms revenue is dictated by demand (as measured by occupancy), pricing (as measured by ADR) and our available supply of hotel rooms. 
 We also use funds from operations FFO ), Adjusted FFO, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as measures of the operating performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 RevPAR 132.20 134.37 136.47 137.12 Occupancy 70.95 72.81 71.06 72.36 ADR 186.32 184.56 192.05 189.50 
 
 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company. Net loss attributable to the Company decreased 5.7 million, from 63.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (the 2023 quarter to 57.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 quarter as a result of the factors discussed below. 
 Revenue. Rooms revenue from our hotel properties decreased 57.6 million, or 21.3 , to 213.0 million in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. This decrease is attributable to a decrease of 35.7 million from our Hotel Dispositions, 19.9 million from the KEYS A and B properties that went into receivership, 2.6 million from our comparable hotel properties, and 51,000 from the Stirling hotel properties, partially offset by higher rooms revenue of 611,000 from the Le Meridien that opened in August 2024. Our comparable hotel properties experienced an increase of 1.0 in room rates and a 186 basis point decrease in occupancy. 
 Food and beverage revenue decreased 5.8 million, or 11.2 , to 46.4 million. This decrease is attributable to a decrease of 6.0 million from our Hotel Dispositions and 582,000 from the KEYS A and B properties that went into receivership, partially offset by higher sales of food and beverage of 669,000 at our comparable hotel properties and 74,000 from the Le Meridien that opened in August 2024. 
 Other hotel revenue, which consists mainly of Internet access, parking, and spa revenue, decreased 2.9 million, or 14.7 , to 16.7 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of 3.7 million from our Hotel Dispositions, 814,000 from the KEYS A and B properties that went into receivership, and 17,000 from the Stirling hotel properties, partially offset by an increase of 1.7 million at our comparable hotel properties and 43,000 from the Le Meridien that opened in August 2024. Other non-hotel revenue decreased 83,000, or 12.5 , to 582,000 in the 2024 quarter as compared to the 2023 quarter. 
 Hotel Operating Expenses. Hotel operating expenses decreased 37.8 million, or 16.2 , to 194.8 million. Hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and management fees. Direct expenses decreased 20.2 million in the 2024 quarter as compared to the 2023 quarter, which was primarily comprised of a decrease of 14.4 million from our Hotel Dispositions and 6.3 million from the KEYS A and B properties that went into receivership, partially offset by an increase of 311,000 from our comparable hotel properties and 197,000 from the Le Meridien that opened in August 2024. Direct expenses were 31.6 of total hotel revenue for the 2024 quarter and 31.4 for the 2023 quarter. Indirect expenses and management fees decreased 17.6 million in the 2024 quarter as compared to the 2023 quarter, which was primarily comprised of a decrease of 15.9 million from our Hotel Dispositions, 8.8 million from the KEYS A and B properties that went into receivership, partially offset by an increase of 6.8 million from our comparable hotel properties and 278,000 from the Le Meridien that opened in August 2024. 
 53 

Property Taxes, Insurance and Other. Property taxes, insurance and other expense increased 717,000, or 4.1 , to 18.1 million during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter, which was primarily due to an increase of 4.6 million from our comparable hotel properties, 93,000 from the Le Meridien that opened in August 2024, and 57,000 from our Stirling properties, partially offset by a decrease of 2.6 million from our Hotel Dispositions and 1.4 million from the KEYS A and B properties that went into receivership. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 8.2 million, or 17.9 , to 37.7 million during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter, which was primarily due to a decrease of 5.6 million from our Hotel Dispositions, 3.2 million from the KEYS A and B properties that went into receivership, and 142,000 from our comparable hotel properties primarily related to fully depreciated assets, partially offset by an increase of 408,000 from the Le Meridien that opened in August 2024 and 280,000 from our Stirling properties. 
 Advisory Services Fee. Advisory services fee decreased 539,000, or 4.3 , to 11.9 million in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. The advisory services fee represents fees incurred in connection with the advisory agreement between Ashford Inc. and the Company and between Ashford Inc. and Stirling OP. In the 2024 quarter, the advisory services fee was comprised of a base advisory fee of 8.2 million, equity-based compensation of 218,000 associated with equity grants of our common stock, PSUs, LTIP units and Performance LTIP units awarded to the officers and employees of Ashford Inc., reimbursable expenses of 3.3 million and a performance participation fee of 111,000 associated with the Stirling OP advisory agreement with Ashford Inc.

 Corporate, General and Administrative. Corporate, general and administrative expense increased 1.2 million from 3.9 million in the 2023 quarter to 5.1 million in the 2024 quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to higher legal and professional costs of 450,000, higher reimbursed operating expenses of Ashford Securities of 723,000 and higher public company cost of 198,000, partially offset by lower miscellaneous expenses of 182,000. 
 Gain (Loss) on Consolidation of VIE and Disposition of Assets and Hotel Properties. Gain on consolidation of VIE and disposition of assets and hotel properties decreased 6.4 million from 6.4 million in the 2023 quarter to 9,000 in the 2024 quarter. The gain in the 2023 quarter primarily related to the sale of WorldQuest Resort in Orlando, Florida. 
 Gain (Loss) on Derecognition of Assets. Gain on derecognition of assets was 11.1 million in the 2024 quarter. The gain primarily represents the accrued interest expense associated with the default of the KEYS A and KEYS B loans, which resulted in a corresponding increase of the contract asset on our consolidated balance sheet as we expect to be released from this obligation upon final resolution with the lender. On July 2, 2024, the Courtyard Plano Legacy Park and the Residence Inn Plano were foreclosed on at a public auction. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Entities. Equity in loss of unconsolidated entities decreased 5,000 during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter.

The 2023 quarter included equity in loss of 125,000 from OpenKey and 13,000 from an investment in an entity that owns the Meritage Resort and Spa and the Grand Reserve at the Meritage in Napa, California. 
 Interest Income. Interest income was 1.8 million and 1.9 million for the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively. The decrease in interest income in the 2024 quarter was primarily attributable to lower excess cash balances in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. 
 Other Income (Expense). Other income consisted of miscellaneous income of 36,000 in the 2024 quarter and 34,000 in the 2023 quarter. 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Discounts and Loan Costs. Interest expense and amortization of discounts and loan costs decreased 20.8 million, or 23.7 , to 66.8 million during the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. The decrease is primarily due to a 10.8 million decrease on the Oaktree loan attributable to a lower principal balance and the Oaktree deferred loan costs becoming fully amortized, a decrease of 8.3 million from our Hotel Dispositions, and lower default interest and late charges recorded on mortgage loans previously in default of 4.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest expense of 2.0 million at our comparable hotel properties primarily due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt, 337,000 from the Le Meridien and 308,000 at our Stirling properties related to a higher interest rate on the new loan. The average SOFR rates for the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter were 5.17 and 5.08 , respectively. 
 Interest Expense Associated with Hotels in Receivership . Interest expense associated with hotels in receivership decreased 629,000, from 11.7 million in 2023 quarter to 11.1 million in 2024 quarter. The decrease is due to lower interest 
 54 

rates, default charges and late fees on the KEYS Pool A and KEYS Pool B mortgage loans. On July 2, 2024, the Courtyard Plano Legacy Park and the Residence Inn Plano were foreclosed on at a public auction. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Write-off of Premiums, Loan Costs and Exit Fees. Write-off of premiums, loan costs and exit fees decreased 1.2 million to 17,000 in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter.

 Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt. Gain on extinguishment of debt in the 2024 quarter was 2.7 million. In June 2024, the Company was informed by its lender that the lender intended to exercise remedies for the maturity default on the Ashton Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, which secured the Company s 8.9 million mortgage loan. The Company and the lender agreed to a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which was completed on July 16, 2024 and resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately 2.6 million. 
 Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives. Realized and unrealized loss on derivatives increased 3.5 million from 2.7 million in the 2023 quarter to 6.2 million in the 2024 quarter. In the 2024 quarter, we recognized an unrealized loss of 12.3 million associated with interest rate caps and an unrealized loss of 1.2 million from the revaluation of the embedded debt derivative in the Oaktree Agreement, partially offset by a realized gain of 7.3 million related to payments from counterparties on interest rate caps. In the 2023 quarter, we recognized an unrealized loss of 12.6 million associated with interest rate caps and an unrealized loss of 436,000 from the revaluation of the embedded debt derivative in the Oaktree Agreement, partially offset by a realized gain of 10.3 million related to payments from counterparties on interest rate caps. 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit. Income tax (expense) benefit changed 572,000, from expense of 127,000 in the 2023 quarter to a benefit of 445,000 in the 2024 quarter. This change was primarily due to a decrease in current state taxes in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. 
 (Income) Loss from Consolidated Entities Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests . Our noncontrolling interest partners in consolidated entities were allocated a loss of 477,000 in the 2024 quarter and 0 in the 2023 quarter.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company held cash and cash equivalents of 119.7 million and restricted cash of 114.3 million, the vast majority of which is comprised of lender and manager-held reserves. As of September 30, 2024, 26.7 million was also due to the Company from third-party hotel managers, most of which is held by one of the Company s managers and is available to fund hotel operating costs. At September 30, 2024, our net debt to gross assets was 66.3 . 
 The Company s cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of corporate cash invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates of less than 90 days and corporate cash held at commercial banks in Insured Cash Sweep ICS accounts, which are fully insured by the FDIC. The Company s cash and cash equivalents also includes property-level operating cash deposited with commercial banks that have been designated as a Global Systemically Important Bank G-SIB by the Financial Stability Board FSB and a small amount deposited with other commercial banks. 
 Based on our current level of operations, our cash flow from operations, capital market activities, asset sales and our existing cash balances should be adequate to meet upcoming anticipated requirements for interest and principal payments on debt (excluding any potential final maturity payments and paydowns for extension tests), working capital, and capital expenditures for the next 12 months and dividends required to maintain our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. With respect to upcoming maturities, no assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance our upcoming maturities. Additionally, no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or, if we do, what the amount and terms will be. Our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy or may result in lender foreclosure. 
 Our cash position from operations is affected primarily by macro industry movements in occupancy and rate as well as our ability to control costs. Further, interest rates can greatly affect the cost of our debt service as well as the value of any financial hedges we may put in place. We monitor industry fundamentals and interest rates very closely. Capital expenditures above our reserves will affect cash flow as well and are impacted by inflation. 
 Certain of our loan agreements contain cash trap provisions that may be triggered if the performance of our hotels declines below a threshold. When these provisions are triggered, substantially all of the profit generated by our hotels is deposited directly into lockbox accounts and then swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of our various lenders. During a cash trap, certain disbursements from these hotel operating cash receipts would require consent of our lenders. At September 30, 2024, 12 of our hotels were in cash traps and approximately 2.4 million of our restricted cash was subject to these cash traps. Our loans currently in cash traps may remain subject to cash trap provisions for a substantial period of time, which could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition or our qualification as a REIT. 
 We have extension options relating to certain property-level loans that will permit us to extend the maturity date of our loans if certain conditions are satisfied at the respective extension dates, including the achievement of debt yield targets required in order to extend such loans. To the extent we decide to extend the maturity date of the debt outstanding under the loans, we may be required to prepay a significant amount of the loans in order to meet the required debt yield targets. There can be no assurances that we will be able to meet the conditions for extensions pursuant to the respective terms of such loans. 
 If we violate covenants in our debt agreements, we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms, if at all. The assets of certain of our subsidiaries are pledged under non-recourse indebtedness and are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of Ashford Trust or Ashford Trust OP, our operating partnership, and the liabilities of such subsidiaries do not constitute the obligations of Ashford Trust or Ashford Trust OP. 
 Mortgage and mezzanine loans are nonrecourse to the borrowers, except for customary exceptions or carve-outs that trigger recourse liability to the borrowers in certain limited instances. Recourse obligations typically include only the payment of costs and liabilities suffered by lenders as a result of the occurrence of certain bad acts on the part of the borrower. However, in certain cases, carve-outs could trigger recourse obligations on the part of the borrower with respect to repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loans. We have entered into customary guaranty agreements pursuant to which we guaranty payment of any recourse liabilities of the borrowers that result from non-recourse carve-outs (which include, but are not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, willful conduct resulting in waste, misappropriations of rents following an event of default, voluntary bankruptcy filings, unpermitted transfers of collateral, and certain environmental liabilities). In the opinion of management, none of these guaranty agreements, either individually or in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

We have entered into certain customary guaranty agreements pursuant to which we guaranty payment of any recourse liabilities of our subsidiaries or joint ventures that may result from non-recourse carve-outs, which include, but are not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, willful misconduct resulting in waste, misappropriations of rents following an event of default, voluntary bankruptcy filings, unpermitted transfers of collateral, delinquency of trade payables and certain environmental liabilities. Certain of these guarantees represent a guaranty of material amounts, and if we are required to make payments under those guarantees, our liquidity could be adversely affected. 
 We are committed to an investment strategy where we will pursue hotel-related investments as suitable situations arise. Funds for future hotel-related investments are expected to be derived, in whole or in part, from cash on hand, future borrowings under a credit facility or other loans, or proceeds from additional issuances of common stock, preferred stock (including net proceeds from the sale of any shares of Series J Preferred Stock or Series K Preferred Stock), or other securities, asset sales, and joint ventures. However, we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments. We may, when conditions are suitable, consider additional capital raising opportunities. 
 Our existing hotel properties are mostly located in developed areas with competing hotel properties. Future occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number or quality of competitive hotel properties, home sharing companies or apartment operators offering short-term rentals in its market area. Competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities. 
 
 Debt Transactions 
 The Company continues to work with the lender of the KEYS A and KEYS B loan pools on a consensual transfer of ownership of those hotels to the lender, and the Company anticipates that transfer could occur in the second half of 2024. The original lenders previously transferred the loans to a securitization trust. On March 1, 2024, the Company received notice that the hotel properties securing the KEYS A and KEYS B loan pools have been transferred to a court-appointed receiver. Below is a summary of the hotel properties securing the KEYS Pool A loan and KEYS Pool B loan: 
 KEYS A Loan Pool 
 Courtyard Columbus Tipton Lakes Columbus, IN 
 Courtyard Old Town Scottsdale, AZ 
 Residence Inn Hughes Center Las Vegas, NV 
 Residence Inn Phoenix Airport Phoenix, AZ 
 Residence Inn San Jose Newark Newark, CA 
 SpringHill Suites Manhattan Beach Hawthorne, CA 
 SpringHill Suites Plymouth Meeting Plymouth Meeting, PA 
 KEYS B Loan Pool 
 Courtyard Basking Ridge Basking Ridge, NJ 
 Courtyard Newark Silicon Valley Newark, CA 
 Courtyard Oakland Airport Oakland, CA 
 Courtyard Plano Legacy Park Plano, TX 
 Residence Inn Plano Plano, TX 
 SpringHill Suites BWI Airport Baltimore, MD 
 TownePlace Suites Manhattan Beach Hawthorne, CA 
 We derecognized the hotel properties securing the KEYS Pool A and KEYS Pool B loans from our consolidated balance sheet in March 2024, when the receiver took control of the hotel properties, and accordingly recognized a gain of 133.9 million, which is included in gain (loss) on derecognition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations and recorded a contract asset of 378.2 million, which represented the liabilities we expect to be released from upon final resolution with the lenders on the KEYS Pool A and KEYS Pool B mortgage loans in exchange for the transfer of ownership of the respective hotel properties. 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized an additional gain of 11.7 million, which is included in gain (loss) on derecognition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations that increased the contract asset by a corresponding amount. The additional gain primarily represents the additional accrued interest expense recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an additional gain of 11.1 million, which is included in gain (loss) on derecognition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations that increased the contract asset by a 
 59 

corresponding amount. The KEYS Pool A and the KEYS Pool B mortgage loans as well as all accrued and unpaid interest, default charges and late fees will remain liabilities until final resolution with the lenders is concluded, and thus is included in indebtedness associated with hotels in receivership and accrued interest associated with hotels in receivership on our consolidated balance sheets. On July 2, 2024, the Courtyard Plano Legacy Park and the Residence Inn Plano were foreclosed on at a public auction. As a result the contract asset and corresponding indebtedness associated with hotels in receivership and accrued interest associated with hotels in receivership were reduced for the amounts attributable to each hotel. 
 On March 6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Residence Inn in Salt Lake City, Utah for approximately 19.2 million. The Company repaid approximately 19 million of principal on its mortgage loan partially secured by the hotel property.

 (c) the waiver contained in the Limited Waiver to Credit Agreement shall be effective only in this instance and for the specific purpose for which it was intended and shall not be deemed to be a consent to any other transaction or matter or waiver of compliance in the future, or a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other covenant or provision of the Oaktree Credit Agreement.

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our principal sources of funds to meet our cash requirements include cash on hand, cash flow from operations, capital market activities, property refinancing proceeds and asset sales. Additionally, our principal uses of funds are expected to include possible operating shortfalls, owner-funded capital expenditures, dividends, new investments, and debt interest and principal payments. Items that impacted our cash flow and liquidity during the periods indicated are summarized as follows: 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, pursuant to our consolidated statements of cash flows, which includes changes in balance sheet items, were (37.7) million and 36.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows provided by (used in) operations were impacted by changes in hotel operations, our hotel dispositions and derecognized assets, as well as the timing of collecting receivables from hotel guests, paying vendors, settling with derivative counterparties, settling with related parties and settling with hotel managers. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by investing activities were 211.9 million. Cash inflows consisted of 300.0 million of net proceeds from the disposition of assets and hotel properties, repayments of a note receivable of 2.5 million and 1.5 million from property insurance proceeds, partially offset by cash outflows of 87.5 million for capital improvements made to various hotel properties and 4.5 million from the issuance of a note receivable. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities were 65.9 million. Cash outflows primarily consisted of 99.5 million for capital improvements made to various hotel properties 5.7 million from the issuance of a note receivable and 402,000 of payments for franchise fees, partially offset by cash inflows of 18.2 million related to restricted cash received from the initial consolidation of VIE, 14.5 million of net proceeds from disposition of a hotel property, 1.8 million related to proceeds from property insurance and 5.3 million of proceeds from the payment of a note receivable. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in financing activities were 251.8 million. Cash outflows primarily consisted of 336.5 million for repayments of indebtedness, 16.7 million for payments of loan costs and exit fees, 14.7 million of payments for preferred dividends, 15.1 million of payments for derivatives and distributions to a non-controlling interest in a consolidated entity of 2.5 million, partially offset by 28.2 million of borrowing on indebtedness, 68.3 million of net proceeds from preferred stock offerings, 8.8 million of net proceeds from common stock offerings and 23.9 million from counterparty payments from in-the-money interest rate caps and 4.9 million of contributions from a non-controlling interest in a consolidated entity. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities were 172.2 million. Cash outflows primarily consisted of 342.9 million for repayments of indebtedness, 10.5 million for payments of loan costs and exit fees, 10.6 million of payments for preferred dividends and 22.3 million of payments for derivatives, partially offset by 101.7 million of borrowings on indebtedness, 60.1 million of net proceeds from preferred stock offerings 5.2 million of contributions from noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities and 47.6 million from counterparty payments comprised of 31.7 million from in-the-money interest rate caps and 16.1 million from the sales of interest rate caps. 
 
 Dividend Policy . Distributions are authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors. The board of directors will continue to review our distribution policy on at least a quarterly basis. Our ability to pay distributions to our preferred or common stockholders will depend, in part, upon our receipt of distributions from our operating partnership. This, in turn, may depend upon receipt of lease payments with respect to our properties from indirect subsidiaries of our operating partnership, the management of our properties by our hotel managers and general business conditions. Distributions to our stockholders are generally taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. However, since a portion of our investments are equity ownership interests in hotels, which result in depreciation and non-cash charges against our income, a portion of our distributions may constitute a non-taxable return of capital, to the extent of a stockholder s tax basis in the stock. To the extent that it is consistent with maintaining our REIT status, we may maintain accumulated earnings of Ashford TRS in that entity. 
 62 

On December 5, 2023, our board of directors reviewed and approved our 2024 dividend policy. We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our outstanding common stock for any quarter during 2024 and expect to pay dividends on our outstanding preferred stock during 2024. Our board of directors will continue to review our dividend policy and make future announcements with respect thereto. We may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on REITs under the Code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions. We may pay dividends in excess of our cash flow. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 Our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months, while certain other properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the winter months. This seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases. Quarterly revenue also may be adversely affected by renovations and repositionings, our managers effectiveness in generating business and by events beyond our control, such as pandemics, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, civil unrest, government shutdowns, airline strikes or reduced airline capacity, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel. To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our REIT status due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue, we expect to utilize cash on hand, borrowings and common stock to fund required distributions. However, we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMA TES 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our accounting policies that are critical or most important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 The following non-GAAP presentations of EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, FFO and Adjusted FFO are presented to help our investors evaluate our operating performance. 
 EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense and amortization of discounts and loan costs, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to reflect only the Company s portion of EBITDA of unconsolidated entities. In addition, we exclude impairment on real estate, gain/loss on disposition of assets and hotel properties, gain/loss on derecognition of assets and gain/loss of unconsolidated entities to calculate EBITDAre, as defined by NAREIT. 
 We then further adjust EBITDAre to exclude certain additional items such as write-off of premiums, loan costs and exit fees, other income/expense, net, transaction and conversion costs, stock/unit-based compensation and non-cash items, such as amortization of unfavorable contract liabilities, realized and unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, severance, as well as our portion of adjustments to EBITDAre of unconsolidated entities. 
 We present EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre because we believe they are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Our management team also uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as calculated by us may not be comparable to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre reported by other companies that do not define EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre exactly as we define the terms. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as an indicator of liquidity.

The following table reconciles net income (loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) (59,128) (64,451) 64,088 (150,930) Interest expense and amortization of discounts and loan costs 66,825 87,631 209,202 243,096 Interest expense associated with hotels in receivership

We calculate FFO and Adjusted FFO in the following table. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by NAREIT, which is net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on consolidation of VIE and disposition of assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment charges on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined by GAAP. Our calculation of Adjusted FFO excludes write-off of premiums, loan costs and exit fees, other income/expense, net, transaction and conversion costs, legal, advisory and settlement costs, stock/unit-based compensation, gains/losses on insurance settlements and non-cash items such as deemed dividends on redeemable preferred stock, amortization of loan costs, amortization of credit facility exit fee, default interest and late fees, unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt and preferred stock, severance, and interest expense associated with hotels in receivership and our portion of adjustments to FFO related to unconsolidated entities. We exclude items from Adjusted FFO that are either non-cash or are not part of our core operations in order to provide a period-over-period comparison of our operating results. We present FFO and Adjusted FFO because we consider FFO and Adjusted FFO important supplemental measures of our operational performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO and Adjusted FFO when reporting their results. FFO and Adjusted FFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO and Adjusted FFO exclude depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, FFO and Adjusted FFO provide performance measures that, when compared year over year, reflect the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We consider FFO and Adjusted FFO to be appropriate measures of our ongoing normalized operating performance as a REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that either do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial performance or (b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. However, to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, we believe that FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered along with our net income or loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. 
 At September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness of 2.7 billion included 2.5 billion of variable-rate debt. The impact on our results of operations of a 25-basis point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024 would be approximately 6.3 million per year. However, we currently have various interest rate caps in place that limit this exposure. Interest rate changes have no impact on the remaining 200.1 million of fixed-rate debt. 
 The above amounts were determined based on the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowings and assume no changes in our capital structure. As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed at September 30, 2024, it does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Accordingly, the information presented herein has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on exposures that arise during the period, the hedging strategies in place at the time, and the related interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Palm Beach Florida Hotel and Office Building Limited Partnership, et al. v. Nantucket Enterprises, Inc. This litigation involves a landlord tenant dispute from 2008. This litigation was resolved in 2017 with the determination and reimbursement of attorney s fees being the only remaining dispute. The negotiations relating to the potential payment of the remaining attorneys fees remained open, pending the appeal of a contempt order against the Maraist Law Firm for failing to produce their fee records. We previously accrued approximately 504,000 in legal fees. In September 2024, a settlement was reached to resolve the prevailing party s legal fees in the amount of 1.4 million. As a result an additional accrual of approximately 896,000 was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is included in other hotel expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. 
 On December 20, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against one of the Company s hotel management companies in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Contra Costa alleging violations of certain California employment laws, which class action affects nine hotels owned by subsidiaries of the Company. The court has entered an order granting class certification with respect to: (i) a statewide class of non-exempt employees of our manager who were allegedly deprived of rest breaks as a result of our manager s previous written policy requiring its employees to stay on premises during rest breaks; and (ii) a derivative class of non-exempt former employees of our manager who were not paid for allegedly missed breaks upon separation from employment. Notices to potential class members were sent out on February 2, 2021. Potential class members had until April 4, 2021 to opt out of the class; however, the total number of employees in the class has not been definitively determined and is the subject of continuing discovery. The opt-out period has been extended until such time that discovery has concluded. In May 2023, the trial court requested additional briefing from the parties to determine whether the case should be maintained, dismissed, or the class de-certified. After submission of the briefs, the court requested that the parties submit stipulations for the court to rule upon. On February 13, 2024, the judge ordered the parties to submit additional briefing related to on-site breaks. The Court has ordered the parties to complete a second mediation no later than January 31, 2025. While we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss associated with this litigation because there remains uncertainty under California law with respect to a significant legal issue, discovery relating to class members continues, and the trial judge retains discretion to award lower penalties than set forth in the applicable California employment laws, we do not 
 69 

believe that any potential loss to the Company is reasonably estimable at this time. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts have been accrued. 
 We are also engaged in other legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. To the extent the claims giving rise to these legal proceedings are not covered by insurance, they relate to the following general types of claims: employment matters, tax matters and matters relating to compliance with applicable law (for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws). The likelihood of loss from these legal proceedings is based on the definitions within contingency accounting literature. We recognize a loss when we believe the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Based on the information available to us relating to these legal proceedings and/or our experience in similar legal proceedings, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we had a cyber incident that resulted in the potential exposure of certain personal information. We have completed an investigation and have identified certain information that may have been exposed and notified potentially impacted individuals pursuant to applicable state guidelines. All systems have been restored. We believe that we maintain a sufficient level of insurance coverage related to such events, and the related incremental costs incurred to date are immaterial. In February of 2024, two class action lawsuits were filed, one in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and a second in the 68th District Court for Dallas County related to the cyber incident. The lawsuit filed in the 68th District Court was subsequently dismissed and refiled in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On March 12, 2024, the court ordered the two cases be consolidated. The consolidated case is currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On May 17, 2024, we filed a Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which is currently pending before the Court. 
 Our assessment may change depending upon the development of any current or future legal proceedings, and the final results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If we ultimately do not prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses exceed our current estimates of the range of potential losses, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in future periods. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, or prospects in a material and adverse manner. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 During the period between August 23, 2024 and September 20, 2024, the Company exchanged a total of 1,531,267 shares of its common stock (prior to the reverse stock split) for an aggregate of 71,300 shares of preferred stock with certain holders of its 8.45 Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, 7.375 Series F Cumulative Preferred Stock, 7.375 Series G Cumulative Preferred Stock, 7.50 Series H Cumulative Preferred Stock and 7.50 Series I Cumulative Preferred Stock. The issuance of the shares of the common stock was made by the Company pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act on the basis that these offers constituted an exchange with existing holders of the Company s securities. No commission or other remuneration was paid to any party for soliciting such exchange and the transactions did not involve a public offering. In consideration for the common share issuances, the Company received the preferred shares from the stockholders, which preferred shares were cancelled and of no further effect.

 On November 8, 2024, the parties to the Advisory Agreement entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Third Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the Second Amendment ).

In addition, the Second Amendment places certain limitations on the operations of the Company and Ashford Trust OP should a Potential Company Change of Control (as defined in the Amendment) occur. 
 The foregoing description of the Amendment contained in this Item 5 does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.12 and incorporated herein by reference.
