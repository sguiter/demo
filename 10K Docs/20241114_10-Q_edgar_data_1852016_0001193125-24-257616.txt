As described in Note 6, the deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account).

The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants.

If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. 
 If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.

 combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 
 If the Company has not completed a Business Combination within months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or such later date if the date is extended (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share
 price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 
 The holders of the Founder Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Founder Shares acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares.

Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, due to changes in fair value in warrant liability, non-deductible

 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. As such, the Company has recorded a excise tax liability in the amount of and on the condensed balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The liability does not impact the condensed statements of operations and is offset against additional paid-in

 days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within business days following a Business Combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per Public Warrant;

 If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless. 
 The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or saleable until days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions.

may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the initial public offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B common stock resulted in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B common stock; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock; 

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or warrants. 
 35 

Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our common stock; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we erate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and 

other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. In the short term, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination. There can be no assurance that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. Proposed Business Combination On February 21, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Merger Agreement ), by and among the Company, Car Tech Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), and Car Tech, LLC, an Alabama limited liability company Car Tech ). The transactions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (defined below), will constitute a Business Combination as contemplated by the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (Car Tech having been converted to a Delaware limited liability company), Merger Sub will merge with and into Car Tech, with Car Tech surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ). Upon the consummation of the Merger, subject to approval by the Company s stockholders and other customary closing conditions, the combined company will be renamed and is expected to list on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, in consideration of the Merger, membership interests in Car Tech (the Car Tech Units will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the Company s common stock (the Parent Common Stock for each Car Tech Unit owned calculated by dividing (i) a fraction equal to (a) the quotient of (x) the Aggregate Merger Consideration divided by (y) ten dollars 10.00), by (ii) the number of Car Tech Units that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Aggregate Merger Consideration means (I) 80,000,000 plus the amount of any shortfall in the Company s obligation to source at least 50,000,000 in proceeds from a private placement to be consummated immediately prior to the Merger, and an additional (II) 40,000,000 (the Earn Out Consideration ). 
 36 

Pursuant to Lock-up Agreements executed in connection with the Merger Agreement, all of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to holders of Car Tech Units (other than 500,000 shares issued pursuant to clause (I) of the definition of Aggregate Merger Consideration) will be subject to time based restrictions on transfer, and the 4,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to holders of Car Tech Units based on the Earn Out Consideration will be subject to additional transfer restrictions, release and forfeiture. Other Agreements executed in connection with the Merger Agreement include a Contribution and Exchange Agreement executed by Car Tech s principal equity holder and the Company, a Support Agreement executed by the Company and Car Tech and the Company s Sponsor and certain members of Car Tech, and a Warrant Transfer and Option Agreement executed by the Company s Sponsor and an affiliate of the underwriter in the Company s Initial Public Offering and Car Tech s principal equity holder. In connection with the proposed business combination, the Company intends to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4, which will include a proxy statement to be sent to the Company s stockholders and a prospectus for the registration of the Company s Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (as amended from time to time, the Registration Statement ). A full description of the terms of the proposed business combination is expected to be provided in the Registration Statement. Extension of Combination Period April 2024 Special Meeting On April 16, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the April 2024 Special Meeting ). As of March 5, 2024, the record date of the April 2024 Special Meeting, there were 7,327,478 issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock comprised of 7,077,478 shares of the Company s Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share Class A Shares ), and 250,000 shares of the Company s Class B common stock, par value 0.0001 per share. At the April 2024 Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the proposal to file an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware (the Amendment to extend the date from May 2, 2024 to November 2, 2024 (the Extended Date and to allow the board of directors of the Company (the Board ), without another stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the date to consummate an initial business combination after the 
 37 

Extended Date up to six times, by an additional month each time, upon two days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, up to May 2, 2025 (the Additional Extension Date and together with the Extended Date the Extension and such proposal, the Extension Proposal by which the Company must (1) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (an initial business combination or (2) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and redeem all of the Class A Shares included as part of the units sold in the Company s initial public offering that was consummated on November 2, 2021. On April 17, 2024, to effectuate the Extension, the Company filed the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. On October 30, 2024, in accordance with the Amendment, the Board elected to further extend the date to consummate an initial business combination from November 2, 2024, to December 2, 2024 (the First Optional Extension Date ), and on October 31, 2024, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission to effect the required two days notice. At the April 2024 Special Meeting, the Company s stockholders also approved a proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to eliminate the limitation that the Company shall not redeem Class A Common Stock included as part of the units sold in the IPO (including any shares issued in exchange thereof, the public shares to the extent that such redemption would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 (the Redemption Limitation to allow us to redeem public shares irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed the Redemption Limitation. As a result of the April 2024 Special Meeting, stockholders holding 839,322 Class A Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company s trust account Trust Account in connection with the Extension. As a result, 9,400,518 (approximately 11.20 per share) was removed from the Trust Account on or about April 23, 2024 to pay such holders. As of April 30, 2024 there was 8,344,699 (or approximately 11.30 per share of Class A common stock that is subject to redemption) held in the Trust Account. First Monthly Extension of Combination Period As contemplated in the amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that allows the Board, without a stockholder vote, to elect to further extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination as discussed above, on October 30, 2024, the Board approved an extension of the date by which the Company is required to complete an initial business combination from November 2, 2024 to December 2, 2024 (the First Optional Extension ). The Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K which constituted notice to stockholders of the Board s approval of the First Optional Extension. Nasdaq Delisting On October 29, 2024, the Company, received a written notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market that the Company s securities would be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market by reason of the failure of the Company to complete its initial business combination by October 28, 2024 (36 months from the effectiveness of the Company s IPO registration statement) as required by IM-5101-2. Accordingly, trading in the Company s Class A Common Stock, Units and Warrants was suspended at the opening of business on November 5, 2024 and Form 25-NSE was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which removed the Company s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company s Class A Common Stock, Units and Warrants continue to be traded in the over-the-counter market. There is no guarantee, however, that a broker will continue to make a market in such securities or that trading thereof will continue on the over-the-counter market or otherwise. 
 38 

Notwithstanding the delisting of the Company s securities from Nasdaq, it remains the intention of the Company to continue to pursue the previously announced initial business combination as well as the listing of its Common Stock and Warrants on The Nasdaq Stock Market in connection therewith. However, there can be no assurance that the initial business combination will ultimately be successful or the Company s securities will ultimately be listed on Nasdaq. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the initial public offering, and identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing a business combination. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a net loss of 691,836 and 749,750, respectively. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of interest income earned on the funds held in Trust in the amount of 109,352, a gain of 235,000 on the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities associated with the warrants issued as part of the Units sold in the Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, interest income earned on the operating account of 1,276 offset by operating expenses that total 999,367, interest expense of 20,879 and income tax expense of 17,218. Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of interest income earned on the funds held in Trust in the amount of 227,386, interest income earned on operating and investment accounts of 6,832 and income tax benefit of 86,851 offset by a loss of 705,000 on the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities associated with the warrants issued as part of the Units sold in the Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, operating expenses that total 359,684 and interest expense of 6,135. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a net loss of 2,120,903 and net income of 2,027,782, respectively. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of interest income earned on the funds held in Trust in the amount of 478,018, a gain of 705,000 on the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities associated with the warrants issued as part of the Units sold in the Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, interest income earned on the operating account of 3,135 offset by operating expenses that total 3,188,033, interest expense of 48,674 and income tax expense of 70,349. Our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of interest income earned on the funds held in Trust in the amount of 3,984,184, interest income earned on operating and investment accounts of 7,895, a gain of 705,000 on the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities associated with the warrants issued as part of the Units sold in the Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants offset by operating expenses that total 1,712,882, interest expense of 11,138 and income tax expense of 945,277.

Going Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024 there was 8,493,268 (or approximately 11.51 per share) held in the Trust Account. Cash of 86,320 was held outside of the Trust Account on September 30, 2024 and was available for working capital purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there was 100,632 held in the restricted investment account which together with interest earned thereon and after payment of associated taxes and account fees up to 100,000 is reserved to pay dissolution costs and expenses in the event the Company fails to complete an initial business combination and is dissolved. To the extent such funds in the restricted investment account are insufficient (less than 100,000), additional funds will be dispersed from the Trust up to a combined total of 100,000. Any amount in the restricted investment account in excess of 100,000 will be for the benefit of the Trust. If an initial business combination is consummated all funds then held in the restricted investment account, including amounts previously reserved to pay dissolution costs and expenses in the event the Company fails to complete an initial business combination will be for the benefit of the Trust. As described in Note 6, the 8,050,000 deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the Company may lack the financial resources it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. Management has also determined that, in accordance with the Company s amended and restated articles of incorporation, if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination by December 2, 2024 as extended by the first of up to six one-month extensions at the election of the Company s Board of Directors from November 2, 2024, subject to up to five additional one-month extensions at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors, up to May 2, 2025, 
 40 

as discussed above, the Company will cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, and amounts paid to redeem public shares, to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue growth strategies. If an initial business combination agreement requires the Company to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price or requires the Company to have a minimum amount of cash at closing (including any cash available from the Trust Account), the Company will need to arrange for third-party financing. We may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to completing our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of the remaining public shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 186,952 held outside the Trust Account, of which 100,632 is held in a restricted account and reserved to pay taxes and dissolution costs and expenses in the event the Company fails to complete in initial business combination and is dissolved. We intend to use all of such funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. The balance will be used to pay accrued taxes. Convertible Working Capital Loan In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into private placement units at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. 
 41 

Loan Payable - Sponsor Per a Commitment Letter, dated July 19, 2022, the Sponsor undertook upon the Company s written request to make available an aggregate amount of up to 250,000 to provide the Company funds for working capital purposes to ensure that the Company would continue as a going concern for at least 12 months. A second Commitment Letter was dated May 4, 2023 for up to an additional 750,000. A third Commitment Letter was dated December 20, 2023 for up to an additional 800,000. A third Commitment Letter was dated December 20, 2023 for up to an additional 800,000. A fourth Commitment Letter was executed on July 8, 2024 for up to an additional 750,000. The Sponsor is charging interest at the mid-term applicable federal rate at the time of funding. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Sponsor loaned an aggregate of 400,000 and 1,135,000 to the Company for working capital purposes, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 2,135,000 and 1,000,000 remained outstanding, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was accrued interest of 68,053 and 19,404, respectively. On October 25, 2024, an additional request was made for funds in the amount of 200,000 of the remaining committed funds pursuant to the fourth Commitment Letter dated July 8, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of 15,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support to the Company. We began incurring these fees on October 28, 2021. On January 28, 2023 this agreement was amended to provide that, rather than be payable on a monthly basis, the payments due thereunder commencing with the monthly payment payable on or about February 28, 2023 shall accrue and be payable on the completion of a business combination or the Company s liquidation. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement with B. Riley securities, Inc., upon the consummation of our initial business combination, we will pay B. Riley Securities, Inc. a cash fee in an amount equal to 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders fees which might become payable). No fee will be due if we do not complete an initial business combination.

Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the balance sheet, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. One of the more significant accounting estimates included in these financial statements is the determination of the fair value of the warrant liabilities and the fair value of the non-redemption agreements. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Common stock subject to possible redemption The Company accounts for its shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. The shares of the Company s Class A common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in the amount of 8,593,900 and 17,700,146 are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of the Company s balance sheets, respectively. The shares of Class A common stock that were issued upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock are not subject to redemption and accordingly are presented in the stockholders deficit section of the Company s balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The Company s derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as of the closing date of the Initial Public Offering (November 2, 2021) and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The Company has determined the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants are derivative instruments. As the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants meet the definition of a derivative, the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants are measured at fair value at issuance and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations in the period of change. 
 43 

Warrants Instruments We evaluated the Warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , and concluded that a provision in the Warrant Agreement related to certain tender or exchange offers as well as provisions that provided for potential changes to the settlement amounts dependent upon the characteristics of the holder of the warrant, precludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815 and are not eligible for an exception from derivative accounting, the Warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the Balance Sheet. Upon consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Public Warrants and a modified Black-Scholes model to value the Private Placement Warrants. The Company allocated the proceeds received from (i) the sale of Units (which is inclusive of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one Public Warrant), (ii) the sale of Private Placement Warrants, and (iii) the issuance of shares of Class B common stock, first to the warrants based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, with the remaining proceeds allocated to shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption (temporary equity) and Class B common stock (permanent equity) based on their relative fair values at the initial measurement date. The Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Public Warrants were valued using the publicly available price for the Warrant and are classified as Level 1 on the Fair Value Hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company used a modified Black-Scholes model to value the Private Placement Warrants. The Company relied upon the implied volatility of the Public Warrants and the implied volatilities of comparable companies and the closing price as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, per Public Warrant, respectively, to estimate the volatility for the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Private Placement Warrants were classified within Level 3 of the Fair Value Hierarchy at the measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs. 
 44 

Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid to transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. US GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and 

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. Net income (loss) per share Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings (losses) per share. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share of common stock does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering, and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net income per share of common stock is the same as basic net income per share of common stock for the periods presented. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 23,500,000 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate. Recent accounting pronouncements In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ). The ASU is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in the ASU address investor requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for the Company in the annual period beginning January 1, 2025, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is still evaluating the presentational effect that ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. We have not engaged in any hedging activities since our inception. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed. 
 45 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), such as this quarterly report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer (our Certifying Officers evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded certain disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to that material weaknesses that existed related our accounting for complex financial instruments and our accounting and reporting for the completeness and accuracy of warrant liabilities and the corresponding change in the fair value of the warrant liability, that led to the restatement of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management additionally identified, as it relates to the material weakness discussed above relating to the accounting for complex financial instruments, a failure to properly record the capital contributions and related costs associated with non-redemption agreements entered into with certain stockholders of the Company in connection with the special meeting of stockholders of the Company held on April 28, 2023 that led to the restatement of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023. In addition, management identified a material weakness in relation to the accounting of contractual liabilities which led to errors in our financial statements in the accounting of consulting fees pursuant to a consulting agreement with our chief financial officer that led to the restatement of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023. In addition to the remediation steps discussed below, the Company has added additional steps to its internal financial review process in order to provide reasonable assurance that a reoccurrence of a material misstatement of any item in our financial statements will not occur. As of September 30, 2024, the previously identified material weaknesses have not been remediated. 
 46 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Effective disclosure controls and internal control are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weaknesses. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. If we identify any new material weakness in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 16, 2024 10-K ). Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 10-K. Because our common stock, units and warrants are quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market, instead of a national securities exchange, our stockholders and warrant holders may experience significant volatility in the market price of our stock, units or warrants and have difficulty selling their such securities. Our common stock, units and warrants are currently quoted on the OTC Pink Open Mark (the OTC Pink ), under the ticker symbol AEAE , AEAEU and AEAEW. The OTC Pink is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes and last sale prices in over-the-counter securities. Trading in securities quoted on the OTC Pink is often thin and characterized by volatility. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including the lack of readily available price quotations, the absence of consistent administrative supervision of bid and ask quotations, lower trading volume and market conditions. As a result, there may be wide fluctuations in the market price of our securities for reasons unrelated to operating performance, and this volatility, when it occurs, may have a negative effect on the market price for our securities. Moreover, the OTC Pink is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on this platform is more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national quotation system or stock exchange. Accordingly, our stockholders and warrant holders may not be able to realize a fair price of their shares or warrants when they determine to sell them or may have to hold them for a substantial period of time until the market for such securities improves. An active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained. Although our securities are listed on the OTC Pink Open Market, we cannot assure you that an active, liquid trading market for our shares, units or warrants will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for any of our securities does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares, units or warrants quickly or without depressing the market price for such securities or to sell your such securities at all.
