for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
has not generated sufficient positive cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had a working capital deficiency
of which includes related party liabilities of . These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding
our ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company is executing on a plan to achieve a reduction in cash operating losses. Included within the working capital deficiency above
is a term note for to EuroAmerican Investment Corp. EuroAmerican ), together with accrued interest of ,
which has a maturity date of , having been extended on a number of occasions from its initial due date of June 11, 2011.
At this time, it is not known whether any further extension of the note beyond March 31, 2025 will be available. However, the Company
believes it may not have sufficient cash to meet its various cash needs through November 30, 2025 unless the Company is able to obtain
additional cash from the issuance of debt or equity securities. Fountainhead, the Company s largest shareholder, has provided working
capital funding to the Company on an as-needed basis, although there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case. The Company
may consider seeking additional equity or debt funding, although there is no assurance that this would be available on acceptable terms
or at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may have to delay or curtail development or commercialization of products,
or cease some of its operations.

1.
Organizational History 

The
Company was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of New York on June 17, 2005 as Vycor Medical LLC .
On August 14, 2007, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Vycor Medical, Inc. Vycor ).
The Company s listing went effective on February 2009 and on November 29, 2010 Vycor completed the acquisition of substantially
all of the assets of NovaVision, Inc. NovaVision and on January 4, 2012 Vycor, through its wholly-owned NovaVision subsidiary,
completed the acquisition of all the shares of Sight Science Limited Sight Science ), a previous competitor to NovaVision. 

2.
Overview of Business 

Vycor
is dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions and operates two distinct
business units within the medical device industry. Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery.
NovaVision provides non-invasive rehabilitation therapies for those who have vision disorders resulting from neurological brain damage
such as that caused by a stroke. Both businesses adopt a minimally or non-invasive approach. The Company leverages joint resources across
the divisions to operate in a cost-efficient manner.

Vycor
Medical 

Vycor
Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. Vycor Medical s ViewSite Brain Access System VBAS is a next generation retraction and access system. Vycor Medical is ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) certified,
and VBAS has U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance and CE Marking for Europe (Class III) for brain and spine surgeries, and regulatory approvals
in several other international markets. 

NovaVision 

NovaVision
provides non-invasive, computer-based rehabilitation therapies targeted at people who have impaired vision as a result of stroke or other
brain injury. 

Strategy 

The
Company is continuing to execute on a plan to achieve revenue growth. The strategy for Vycor Medical includes: increasing market penetration
in the US; increasing international growth in territories where we are not represented or under-represented; continued new product development
in response to market demands and demonstrating applicability in a broader range of pathologies; and adding products complementary to
VBAS where the Company is able to leverage its existing distribution network. 

The
strategy for NovaVision, given the company s resources, and the large size and diversity of its end markets, we believe that the
most efficient way to tackle the distribution of its patient and professional products is by partnering with entities that have either
direct access to the end users or the technological capability to leverage the NovaVision therapy platform, particular in digital health
and into non-medical areas. Management is also open to a broad range of alternatives for NovaVision as a whole, which could comprise
distribution and marketing partnerships, licensing, merger or sale. 

In
August 2024 the Company engaged the services of Maxim Group LLC to assist in its strategy to accelerate the growth of the Company through
strategic acquisitions and partnerships.

The
adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash of 58,885 in the period have no impact on liquidity. The negative change in net income (loss)
adjusted for non-cash items of 118,369 was primarily due a decrease in sales and an increase in certain expenses, particularly regulatory.
The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 125,677 between the 2024 and 2023 periods was partly due to the settlement
of expenses during the 2023 period that were incurred during the final quarter of 2022 and a timing increase in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities in the 2024 period. 

Additional
inventory of 46,292 was purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as part of normal production, and the Company anticipates
purchasing additional new inventory of approximately 100,000 during the next twelve months for VBAS devices. 

Investing
Activities. Cash used for the purchase of chinrests, net of sales, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4,369 and 3,482, respectively.
The Company anticipates limited investing activities during the next twelve months. 

Financing
Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid loans primarily related to insurance of 54,660 and
received insurance financing proceeds of 60,980. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company received insurance financing
proceeds of 64,786 and made repayments of 53,208.

Liquidity
and Plan of Operations, Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
The Company has incurred losses since its inception, including a net loss of 100,463 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
has not generated sufficient positive cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had a working capital deficiency
of 3,809,459, which includes related party liabilities of 3,321,298. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding
our ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

As
described earlier in this ITEM 1 Strategy , the Company is executing on a plan to achieve a growth in revenues. Included within the working capital deficiency
above is a term note for 300,000 to EuroAmerican Investment Corp. EuroAmerican ), together with accrued interest of 508,931,
which has a maturity date of March 31, 2025, having been extended on a number of occasions from its initial due date of June 11, 2011.
At this time, it is not known whether any further extension of the note beyond March 31, 2025 will be available. However, the Company
believes it may not have sufficient cash to meet its various cash needs through November 30, 2025 unless the Company is able to obtain
additional cash from the issuance of debt or equity securities. Fountainhead, the Company s largest shareholder, has provided working
capital funding to the Company on an as-needed basis, although there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case. The Company
may consider seeking additional equity or debt funding, although there is no assurance that this would be available on acceptable terms
or at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may have to delay or curtail development or commercialization of products
or cease some of its operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Uses
of estimates in the preparation of financial statements 

The
preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimated. To the extent management s estimates prove to be incorrect, financial
results for future periods may be adversely affected. Significant estimates and assumptions contained in the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements include management s estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, provision for inventory
obsolescence, useful life of intangible assets, and the fair values of options and warrant included in the determination of debt discounts
and stock-based compensation. 

A
detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a)
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer (also our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (also
our principal financial and accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The
Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ),
have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation,
our CEO and our CFO have concluded that a material weakness occurred as of April 1, 2021 with the resignation of the independent members
of the Company s Audit Committee as of that date. Effective that date, our disclosure and controls were no longer effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports its files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and its CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

The
matter involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were a lack of a functioning audit committee with independent members, resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. This weakness occurred as of April 1, 2021
due to the resignation of the independent members of the Audit Committee from the Board of Directors effective as of April 1, 2021. 

21 

Management
believes that the material weakness set forth did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the
lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, results in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement
in our financial statements in future periods. 

(b)
Changes in Internal Controls 

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

The
Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company s internal control over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

PART
II 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are subject from time to time to litigation, claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. As of November 13, 2024, we
were not a party to any material litigation, claim or suit whose outcome could have a material effect on our financial statements.
