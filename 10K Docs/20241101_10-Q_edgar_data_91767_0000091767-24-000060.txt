 Divestitures ) ) Foreign currency translation ) ) ) Measurement period adjustments ) ) Goodwill at September 29, 2024 
 Goodwill activity reflected under the caption Divestitures relates to the April 2024 divestiture of Protexic. See Note 3 for additional information. Goodwill activity reflected under the caption Measurement period adjustments relates to the prior year acquisition of Inapel. See Note 3 for additional information. 
 The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually during the third quarter, or from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units or the Company as a whole. The Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of 2024 and analyzed certain qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether a goodwill impairment existed. The Company s assessments reflected a number of significant management assumptions and estimates including the Company s forecast of sales growth, gross profit margins, and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact the Company s conclusions. Based on its assessments, the Company concluded that there was impairment of goodwill for any of its reporting units. 
 Although no reporting units failed the annual impairment test, in management s opinion, the goodwill balances of the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food, and Metal Packaging reporting units are individually at risk of impairment in the near term if each reporting unit s operation does not perform in line with management s expectations, or if there is a negative change in the long-term financial outlook for each reporting unit or in other factors such as the particular discount rates used. In the case of Metal Packaging, t he lower differential between the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit is due to the acquisition of Ball Metalpack Holding, LLC in 2022, at which time the majority of assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at fair value. At September 29, 2024, the total goodwill associated with the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food, and Metal Packaging reporting units was , , and , respectively. 
 In the annual goodwill impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of 2024, projected future cash flows for the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food, and Metal Packaging reporting units were discounted at , , and , respectively, and their estimated fair values were determined to exceed their individual carrying values by approximately , , and , respectively . Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, the discount rates for the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food and Metal Packaging reporting units would have to increase t o , , and , respectively, in order for the estimated fair values of the reporting units to fall below carrying values. 
 During the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at September 29, 2024, the Company considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting units may have been impaired. It is management s opinion that no such events and/or changes in circumstances have occurred.

 Certain of the Company s debt agreements impose restrictions with respect to the maintenance of financial ratios and the disposition of assets.

to effectively convert a portion of the Company s fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, including the semi-annual interest payments, to fixed-rate euro-denominated debt. The swap agreements, which had a maturity of December 18, 2026, provided for the Company to receive semi-annual interest payments in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate and to make semi-annual interest payments in euros at a fixed rate. The risk management objective of entering into the swap agreements was to manage foreign currency risk relating to net investments in certain European subsidiaries denominated in euros. The agreements were designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes.

The new swap agreements, which have a maturity of May 1, 2027, share the same risk management objective as the terminated cross-currency swap agreements and are also designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes. 
 The gain or loss on the net investment hedge derivative instruments is included in the Foreign currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the net investment is sold, diluted, or liquidated. Interest payments received for the cross-currency swaps are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in Interest expense in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

 and , respectively, and its rates for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 1, 2023 were and , respectively. The Company s effective tax rates varied from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions and the relative amounts earned in those jurisdictions, state income taxes, and discrete tax adjustments that were not consistent year over year. 
 The Company and/or its subsidiaries file federal, state and local income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2017. 
 from December 31, 2023 to September 29, 2024 due primarily to an increase in reserves related to existing tax positions. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount reserved for unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024 could increase by approximately over the next twelve months. Although the Company s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental, management believes that any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters have been adequately provided for. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which earnings or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates. As a result, the Company s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. The Company has operations and pays taxes in many countries outside of the U.S. and taxes on those earnings are subject to varying rates. The Company is not dependent upon the favorable benefit of any one jurisdiction to an extent that the loss of such benefit would have a material effect on the Company s overall effective tax rate.

 or more options to renew, with renewal terms that typically extend the lease term in increments from one to . The Company s leases do not have any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. 
 As the implicit rate in the Company s leases is normally not readily determinable, the Company generally calculates its lease liabilities using discount rates based upon the Company s incremental secured borrowing rate, which contemplates and reflects a particular geographical region s interest rate for the leases active within that region of the Company s global operations. The Company further utilizes a portfolio approach by assigning a short rate to contracts with lease terms of years or less and a long rate for contracts greater than years. 
 The Company completed the acquisitions of the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging and the Chattanooga Mill on September 8, 2023. The acquisitions included operating lease assets of and operating lease liabilities of . For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note 3.

 Certain of the Company s leases include variable costs. Variable costs include lease payments that were volume or usage-driven in accordance with the use of the underlying asset, and also non-lease components that were incurred based upon actual terms rather than contractually fixed amounts. In addition, variable costs are incurred for lease payments that are indexed to a change in rate or index.

 Contract assets represent goods produced without alternative use for which the Company is entitled to payment with margin prior to shipment. Upon shipment, the Company is entitled to bill the customer, and therefore amounts included in contract assets will be reduced with the recording of an account receivable as they represent an unconditional right to payment. Contract liabilities represent revenue deferred due to pricing mechanisms utilized by the Company in certain multi-year arrangements, volume rebates, and receipts of advance payments. For multi-year arrangements with pricing mechanisms, the Company will generally defer revenue during the first half of the arrangement and will release the deferral over the second half of the contract term. Contract assets and liabilities are generally short in duration given the nature of products produced by the Company.

 reportable segments, Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging, with all remaining businesses reported as All Other. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company integrated its flexible packaging and thermoformed packaging businesses within its Consumer Packaging segment in order to streamline operations, enhance customer service, and better position the business for accelerated growth. As a result, the Company changed its operating and reporting structure to reflect the way it now manages its operations, evaluates performance, and allocates resources. Accordingly, the Company s consumer thermoformed businesses moved from the All Other group of businesses to the Consumer Packaging segment. The Company s Industrial Paper Packaging segment was not affected by these changes. All prior year segment results presented below have been recast to conform to the new presentation. Also effective January 1, 2024, the Company began conducting its recycling operations, part of the Industrial Paper Packaging segment, as a procurement function. As a result, no recycling net sales were recorded and the margin from the operations reduced Cost of sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024.

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
 Sonoco is a multi-billion dollar global designer, developer, and manufacturer of a variety of highly-engineered and sustainable packaging products serving multiple end markets. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had more than 300 locations in 33 countries, serving some of the world s best-known brands in some 85 nations. The Company s operating and reporting structure consists of two reportable segments, Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging, with all remaining businesses reported as All Other. 
 Sonoco competes in multiple product categories, with the majority of the Company s revenues arising from products and services sold to consumer and industrial products companies for use in the packaging of their products for sale or shipment. The Company also manufactures uncoated recycled paperboard for both internal use and open market sale. Each of the Company s operating units has its own sales staff and maintains direct sales relationships with its customers. 
 Sonoco s goal is to increase its long-term profitability and return capital to its shareholders. Over the past several years, the Company has simplified its business portfolio around fewer, bigger businesses, which has reduced operating complexity and improved agility. For example, in June 2024, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Eviosys, a leading European manufacturer of food cans, ends and closures, for approximately 3.6 billion (approximately 3.9 billion). The transaction is expected to expand Sonoco s global leadership in metal food can and aerosol packaging and to facilitate Sonoco s ability to partner with customers and advance innovation and sustainability in metal packaging offerings. In addition, in September 2023, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging from joint venture partner WestRock Company, to further strengthen and expand the Company s 100 recycled fiber-based packaging solutions. In addition, the Company acquired Inapel in December 2023, significantly expanding its presence in the flexibles packaging services market in Latin America. 
 Sonoco s portfolio transformation strategy also includes significant divestitures. For example, in September 2024, the Company entered into agreements to divest two of its production facilities in China. In April 2024, Sonoco completed the divestiture of Protexic, which manufactured molded expanded polypropylene and expanded polystyrene foam components serving the automotive, electronics, appliances, and other markets. In 2023, the Company completed the divestitures of its U.S. and Mexico Bulksak businesses, which consisted of the manufacture and distribution of flexible intermediate bulk containers, plastic and fiber pallets, and custom fit liners, and its S3 business, which provided customized waste and recycling management programs. 
 In addition to the completed divestitures discussed above, the Company has initiated reviews of strategic alternatives for ThermoSafe, its leading temperature assured packaging business, and TFP, its leading thermoformed and flexible packaging business (together, the Potential Divestitures ). On a standalone basis, ThermoSafe, which is part of the All Other group of businesses, had revenue of 283 million in 2023. On a standalone basis, TFP, which was formed by integrating the Company s flexible packaging and thermoforming packaging businesses within the Consumer Packaging segment effective as of January 1, 2024, had revenue of 1.3 billion in 2023. The Company expects to complete its review of strategic alternatives for TFP in the fourth quarter of 2024 and to complete its review of strategic alternatives for ThermoSafe by the end of the third quarter of 2025. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Potential Divestitures, if completed, to reduce its indebtedness if the pending Eviosys acquisition closes, or to pursue other strategic initiatives if the pending Eviosys acquisition does not close. 
 The Company believes that these completed and potential divestitures will enable greater strategic clarity and operational focus while also generating proceeds to fund deleveraging and capital investments in core businesses. 
 The Company is focused on efficient capital deployment into these larger, core business units to improve economic returns and improve integration effectiveness and speed for acquired strategic assets. In parallel, Sonoco has continued to work on commercial, operational, and supply chain excellence programs intended to shift the mix of our business towards higher-valued products and increase overall productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives, as well as strategic pricing initiatives intended to better capture input costs and the value of the services provided. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company integrated its flexible packaging and thermoformed packaging businesses within the Consumer Packaging segment in order to streamline operations, enhance customer service, and better position the business for accelerated growth. As a result, the Company changed its operating and reporting structure to reflect the way it now manages its operations, evaluates performance, and allocates resources. Accordingly, the Company s consumer 
 43 

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 thermoformed businesses moved from the All Other group of businesses to the Consumer Packaging segment. Also effective January 1, 2024, the Company began conducting its recycling operations, part of the Industrial Paper Packaging segment, as a procurement function. As a result, no recycling net sales are recorded and the margin from the Company s recycling operations reduces Cost of sales. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The Company s financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Sonoco s management considers a variety of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial and operating measures in assessing the Company s financial performance. The key GAAP measures used are net sales, operating profit, gross profit margin, net income attributable to Sonoco and diluted earnings per share. The key non-GAAP measures used are Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. For information about the Company s use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared with Third Quarter 2023 
 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three-month period ended September 29, 2024 versus the three-month period ended October 1, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 declined by 34.6 million or 2.0 , to 1.68 billion, compared to 1.71 billion in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by the absence of 39.5 million sales related to the Protexic divestiture in April 2024, the absence of 32.6 million sales related to the closure of a thermoformed food packaging plant in November 2023, lower sales of 20.6 million resulting from the accounting for the Company s recycling operations as a procurement function effective January 1, 2024, and lower selling prices of 16.8 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in overall volumes, including net sales from acquisitions, of 76.0 million over the prior-year period. 
 GAAP o perating profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 128.1 million, a decrease of 21.4 from the 162.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in GAAP operating profit was primarily due to lower net sales of 52.0 million and a 30.0 million loss on the pending sale of two production facilities in China, partially offset by decreased manufacturing expenses of 56.7 million. Adjusted Operating Pro fit for the third quarter of 2024 was 210.7 million, a decrease of 0.9 from the 212.5 million reported for the same period in 2023. 
 GAAP net income attributable to Sonoco for the third quarter of 2024 decreased to 50.9 million, or 0.51 per diluted share, compared to 130.7 million, or 1.32 per diluted share, for the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in GAAP operating profit as described above, the absence of a 44.0 million gain from the step-up to fair value of the Company s 35 ownership interest in RTS Packaging upon acquiring the remaining 65 ownership interest in September 2023, and additional interest expense of 26.0 million primarily related to the financing of the pending Eviosys acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense of 18.2 million. Adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco and Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were 147.9 million 1.49 per diluted share), compared with 144.9 million 1.46 per diluted share) for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of goods sold decreased by 29.0 million, or 2.2 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower manufacturing expense and lower costs related to the sale of Protexic, partially offset by cost of sales related to the acquisitions of Inapel, the Chattanooga Mill and the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging, higher depreciation expense, and higher employee-related costs. 
 Gross profit decreased by 5.5 million, or 1.5 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the same period last year, primarily due to a decline in net sales. Gross profit as a percent of sales increased slightly to 21.4 from 21.3 in the prior-year quarter. 
 Selling, general and administrative cost s increased by 8.0 million, or 4.4 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher year-over-year acquisition, integration and divestiture-related costs of 7.2 million and net incremental costs of 1.7 million associated with the prior year acquisitions of Inapel, the Chattanooga Mill, and the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging, and the current year divestiture of Protexic.

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 Restructuring/Asset impairment charges totaled 8.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 18.1 million during the same period last year. Additional information regarding restructuring and asset impairment charges is provided in Note 5 to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Loss on divestiture of business and other assets of 31.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects a loss on the pending sale of two production facilities in China. Loss on divestiture of business and other assets of 0.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 reflects a loss from the divestiture of the Company s U.S. BulkSak business. See Note 3 to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Other income, net decreased 36.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to the absence of a 44.0 million gain in the prior year from the step-up to fair value of the Company s 35 ownership interest in RTS Packaging upon acquiring the remaining 65 ownership interest in September 2023. 
 Non- operating pension costs were 0.5 million lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily attributable to lower year-over-year interest cost and increased expected returns on assets. Additional information regarding costs of the Company s retirement plans is provided in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 55.6 million, compared with 29.7 million during the third quarter of 2023. The increase of 26.0 million was primarily due to higher interest from financing transactions relating to the pending Eviosys acquisition. 
 The effective tax rates reflected in GAAP net income and Adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco in the third quarter of 2024 were 30.4 and 21.3 , respectively, compared with 23.6 and 22.7 , respectively, in the corresponding prior year quarter. The increase in the GAAP effective tax rate was primarily due to the absence of a tax benefit on a one-time loss in China as well as an unfavorable adjustment on acquisition costs related to the pending Eviosys acquisition. The effective tax rate on Adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco was lower primarily due to favorable provision-to-return adjustments. 
 Reportable Segments 
 The Company s operating and reporting structure consists of two reportable segments, Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging, with all remaining businesses reported as All Other. The following table summarizes net sales attributable to each of the Company s segments and the All Other group of businesses for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023:

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 Consumer Packaging 
 The products produced and sold within the Consumer Packaging segment are generally used to package a variety of consumer pro ducts and consist primarily of round and shaped rigid paper, steel and plastic containers; metal and peelable membrane ends, closures, and components; thermoformed plastic trays and applications; and high-barrier flexible packaging. These products primarily serve the consumer staples market, focused on food, beverage, household, personal, and pharmaceutical products. 
 Segment sales remained flat compared to the corresponding prior year quarter as the absence of 32.6 million in sales related to the closure of a thermoformed food packaging plant in November 2023 and lower pricing of 21.4 million were offset by a 53.1 million increase in sales driven by higher net volumes, including an increase in sales from acquisitions. 
 Segment operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 5.3 and 5.8 , respectively. The increase was largely due to higher productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives, of 17.5 million, which was partially offset by lower price/cost and higher employee-related expenses. As a result, segment operating profit margin increased to 12.5 in the third quarter of 2024 from 11.9 in the same period last year. 
 Industrial Paper Packaging 
 The primary products produced and sold within the Industrial Paper Packaging segment include goods produced from recycled fiber, including paperboard tubes, cones, and cores; paper-based protective packaging; and uncoated recycled paperboard for folding cartons, can board and laminated structures. Products across this segment support end markets, primarily in paper, textile, and films. 
 Segment sales increased 0.9 from the corresponding prior year quarter primarily due to the acquisitions of the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging and the Chattanooga Mill and the reduction in sales related to the treatment of the segment s recycling operations as a procurement function effective January 1, 2024. 
 Segment operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.4 and 3.1 , respectively, as continued price/cost pressures lowered profitability by 23.4 million and higher employee-related expenses were only partially offset by higher productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives, of 17.7 million and the benefit of higher volumes, including acquisitions, of 8.4 million. As a result, segment operating profit margin decreased to 12 in the third quarter of 2024 from 13 in the same period last year. 
 All Other 
 The primary products produced within the All Other group of businesses consist of a variety of packaging materials including plastic, paper, foam, and various other specialty materials serving a wide variety of end markets including consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and industrial. 
 Sales declined 26.3 from the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to the sale of Protexic. 
 All Other operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA dropped by 15.9 and 17.8 , respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the sale of Protexic and negative price/cost, partially offset by higher productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives. As a result, operating margin increased to 16.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 14.2 in the same quarter last year. 

Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended October 1, 2023 
 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024 compared with the nine-month period ended October 1, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 4.1 to 4.9 billion, compared with 5.1 billion in the same period last year. The decline was primarily attributable to the absence of 90.5 million in sales related to the Protexic divestiture in April 2024, the absence of 73.6 million in sales related to the closure of a thermoformed food packaging plant in November 2023, lower sales of 76.8 million resulting from the accounting for the Company s recycling operations as a procurement function beginning January 1, 2024, and lower pricing of 106.3 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in overall volume, including net sales from acquisitions, of 159.2 million over the prior-year period.

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 GAAP o perating profit for the first nine months of 2024 was 381.0 million, a decrease of 34.4 from the 580.4 million reported in the same period last year. The decrease in GAAP operating profit was primarily due to lower net sales of 337.8 million, a 30.0 million loss in the current period on the pending sale of two production facilities in China, the absence of a net 77.5 million benefit from the sale of the Company s timberland properties and the divestitures of the S3 and U.S. BulkSak businesses in 2023, and additional acquisition, integration and divestiture-related costs of 25.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by decreased manufacturing expenses of 297.9 million. Adjusted operating pro fit for the first nine months of 2024 was 579.6 million, a decrease of 9.0 from the 636.9 million reported for the same period in 2023. 
 GAAP net income attributable to Sonoco for the first nine months of 2024 decreased to 206.9 million, or 2.09 per diluted share, compared to 393.7 million , or 3.98 per diluted share, reported for the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in GAAP operating profit as described above and the absence of a 44.0 million gain from the step-up to fair value of the Company s 35 ownership interest in RTS Packaging upon acquiring the remaining 65 ownership interest in September 2023, partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense of 61.2 million. Adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco and Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024 decreased 7.7 to 386.1 million, or 3.89 per diluted share, from 418.5 million, or 4.24 per diluted share, in the nine-month period ended October 1, 2023. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of goods sold decreased 166.2 million, or 4.1 , primarily related to the sale of Protexic and improved productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by cost of sales related to the acquisitions of Inapel, the Chattanooga Mill, and the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging. 
 Gross profit decreased 42.4 million, or 3.9 , year o ver year, while the Company s gross profit margin percentage remained flat at 21.3 for the first nine months of 2024 , compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in gross profit was driven by volume and price declines, partially offset by higher productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives and positive margin related to the acquisitions of Inapel, the Chattanooga Mill, and the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging. 
 Selling, general and administrative costs for the first nine months of 2024 increased 44.9 million, or 8.3 , year over year. The increase was largely driven by higher year-over-year acquisition, integration and divestiture-related costs of 25.4 million, and net incremental costs of 13.6 million associated with the prior year acquisitions of Inapel, the Chattanooga Mill, and the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging, and the current year divestiture of Protexic. 
 Restructuring/Asset impairment charges totaled 59.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 , compared with 53.0 million of n et charges in the same period last year. Additional information regarding restructuring and asset impairment charges is provided in Note 5 to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Loss on divestiture of business and other assets of 27.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects a loss on the pending sale of two production facilities in China, partially offset by gains from the Company s divestitures of Protexic and the S3 business. Gain on divestiture of business and other assets of 78.8 million in the first nine months of 2023 reflects net gains from the sale of the Company s timberland properties and the divestitures of its S3 and U.S. BulkSak businesses. See Note 3 to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Other income, net was 5.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, reflecting a gain upon the remeasurement to fair value of one of the Company s investments in affiliates. Other income, net was 36.9 million in the first nine months of 2023, reflecting a gain of 44.0 million resulting from the remeasurement of the Company s previously held ownership interest in RTS Packaging to fair value, partially offset by a loss of 7.1 million from the settlement of a contract associated with the acquisition of the Chattanooga Mill that was determined to have unfavorable terms given market conditions at the time of the acquisition. See Note 3 to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Non-operating pe nsion costs remained flat year over year. Additional information regarding costs of the Company s retirement plans is provided in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 GAAP net interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased to 109.4 million, compared with 94.7 million during the first nine months of 2023. The increase of 14.7 million was primarily due to higher interest from financing 
 48 

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 transactions relating to the pending Eviosys acquisition, partially offset by lower year-over-year average debt balances and interest income from the Company s cross-currency swaps. 
 The effective tax rates reflected in GAAP net income and Adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco in the first nine months of 2024 were 24.6 and 24.0 , respectively, compared with 24.8 and 24.4 , respectively, in the prior-year period. The decrease in the effective tax rates on GAAP and Adjusted net income attributable to Sonoco was primarily due to favorable provision-to-return adjustments.

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

The following table summarizes restructuring/asset impairment charges attributable to each of the Company s reportable segments, the All Other group of businesses, and Corporate-related activity during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Restructuring/Asset impairment charges: Consumer Packaging 20,597 16,479 Industrial Paper Packaging 34,138 32,961 All Other 1,362 1,188 Corporate 2,961 2,353 Restructuring/Asset impairment charges 59,058 52,981 
 Consumer Packaging 
 Segment sales decreased 3.2 year to date compared to the prior-year period due to the absence of 73.6 million in sales related to the closure of a thermoformed food packaging plant in November 2023 and lower pricing of 61.3 million, partially offset by an increase of 43.2 million in net volumes, including an increase in sales related to the Inapel acquisition. 
 Year-to-date segment operating profit increased 4.4 as higher productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives of 58.0 million was partially offset by unfavorable net volumes of 5.2 million and higher employee-related expenses. As a result, segment operating profit margin increased from 10.8 in the first nine months of 2023 to 11.6 in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Industrial Paper Packaging 
 Segment sales remained fairly flat year to date compared to the prior-year period as net increases in sales of 141.5 million related to the acquisitions of the remaining ownership interest in RTS Packaging and the Chattanooga Mill, reduced by the disposition of the U.S. BulkSak business, were offset by lower index-related pricing of 45.0 million and the reduction in sales of 76.8 million related to the treatment of the segment s recycling operations as a procurement function effective January 1, 2024. 
 Segment operating profit decreased 20.8 versus the prior-year period primarily due to pricing pressures resulting in lower profitability of 125.6 million and higher employee-related costs, which were only partially offset by higher productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives of 69.2 million and higher volumes from acquisitions of 31.1 million. As a result, segment operating margin decreased from 14.4 in the first nine months of 2023 to 11.4 in the first nine months of 2024. 
 All Other 
 Sales for the All Other group of businesses declined 25.3 year to date compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the sale of Protexic and lower volumes in temperature assured packaging. 
 All Other operating profit declined 26.7 year to date compared to the prior-year period due to the sale of Protexic, lower volumes and negative price/cost, partially offset by higher productivity from procurement savings, production efficiencies, and fixed cost reduction initiatives. Segment operating margin declined to 14.4 year to date compared to 14.7 in 2023.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 To assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company, Sonoco s management uses, both internally and externally, certain financial performance measures that are not in conformity with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments to the Company s GAAP operating results to exclude amounts, including the associated tax effects, relating to: 
 restructuring/asset impairment charges 1 ; 
 acquisition, integration and divestiture-related costs; 
 gains or losses from the divestiture of businesses and other assets; 
 losses from the early extinguishment of debt; 
 non-operating pension costs; 
 amortization expense on acquisition intangibles; 
 changes in last-in, first-out LIFO inventory reserves; 
 certain income tax events and adjustments; 
 derivative gains/losses; 
 other non-operating income and losses; and 
 certain other items, if any. 
 1 Restructuring and restructuring-related asset impairment charges are a recurring item as the Company s restructuring programs usually require several years to fully implement, and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity, the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur. 
 The Company s management believes the exclusion of these amounts improves the period-to-period comparability and analysis of the underlying financial performance of the business. Non-GAAP figures are identified using the term Adjusted, for example, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Sonoco and Adjusted Diluted EPS. More information about the Company s use of non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 In addition to the Adjusted results described above, the Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding the following: interest expense; interest income; provision for income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; non-operating pension costs; net income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests; restructuring/asset impairment charges; changes in LIFO inventory reserves; gains/losses from the divestiture of businesses and other assets; acquisition, integration and divestiture-related costs; other income; derivative gains/losses; and other non-GAAP adjustments, if any, that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. 
 The Company s non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with, nor are they an alternative for, measures conforming to generally accepted accounting principles, and they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. 
 The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with information to evaluate Sonoco s operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. The Company consistently applies its non-GAAP financial measures presented herein and uses them for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate its ongoing operations, and to evaluate the ultimate performance of management and each business unit against plans/forecasts. In addition, these same non-GAAP financial measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community. 
 Material limitations associated with the use of such measures include that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not be comparable with similarly named financial measures of other companies. Furthermore, the calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently. 
 51 

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 To compensate for any limitations in such non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is useful in evaluating the Company s results to review both GAAP information, which includes all of the items impacting financial results, and the related non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain elements, as described above. Further, Sonoco management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider any non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Whenever reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, investors are encouraged to review the related reconciliation to understand how it differs from the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
 
 Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following tables reconcile the Company s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three-month period ended September 29, 2024 and the three-month period ended October 1, 2023.

 The Company does not calculate net income by segment; therefore, Adjusted EBITDA by segment is reconciled to the closest GAAP measure of segment profitability, segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is the measure of segment profit or loss reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating 
 53 

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 resources to the segments and assessing their performance in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 280 - Segment Reporting, as prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. 
 Segment results viewed by the Company s management to evaluate segment performance do not include the following: restructuring/asset impairment charges; amortization of acquisition intangibles; acquisition, integration and divestiture-related costs; changes in LIFO inventory reserves; gains/losses from the sale of businesses or other assets; gains/losses from derivatives; or certain other items, if any, the exclusion of which the Company believes improves the comparability and analysis of the ongoing operating performance of the business. Accordingly, the term segment operating profit is defined as the segment s portion of operating profit excluding those items. All other general corporate expenses have been allocated as operating costs to each of the Company s reportable segments and All Other.

 Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash generated from operations fo r the first nine months of 2024 wa s 437.6 million, compared with 616.9 million in the same period of 2023, a year-over-year decrease of 179.2 million . GAAP net income decreased by 186.6 million year over year as described in the Results of Operations section above. Net working capital used 115.8 million of cash in the first nine months of 2024, while providing 67.3 million in the same period last year, for a year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow o f 183.2 million. Accounts receivable used 98.3 million more cash during the first nine months of 2024 than in the same period last year as a result of the impact of the changing mix in customer payment terms more than offsetting the impact of lower revenues year over year. Inventory was a use of cash of 6.7 million in the first nine months of 2024, while last year was a source of cash of 277.4 million. This lower year-over-year use of cash was expected as the Company ended 2022 with a substantial inventory position driven by pandemic-related supply chain uncertainty. Accounts payable was a source of cash of 73.5 million in the first nine months as compared to a use of cash of 125.7 million in the same period last year. As inventories and supply chain normalized in the second half of 2023 and first half of 2024, purchasing activity has normalized. The Company has continued to actively manage inventories and review payment terms with customers and suppliers to address risk and balance economic benefit. Changes in accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities provided cash totaling 43.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024, and used 9.5 million of cash in the same period last year. The 53.2 million lower use of cash in the current year was largely driven by the lower year-over-year payout of management incentive compensation. 
 Investing activities used 178.1 million of cash in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 459.7 million in the same period last year, a lower year-over-year use of cash of 281.7 million. The lower year-over-year use of cash was primarily attributable to lower acquisition spending as the Company invested 313.4 million in the RTS Packaging and Chattanooga Mill acquisitions in the first nine months of 2023 while acquisition spending in the current year was only 3.7 million. Capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2024 were 271.3 million, 16.5 million higher than the same period last year. Proceeds from sale of businesses provided 81.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by the sale of Protexic, compared with 31.1 million in the prior year, from the sales of the Company s S3 and U.S. BulkSak businesses. Proceeds from the sale of assets were 72.7 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily from the March 2023 sale of the Company s timberland properties. Additionally, proceeds from the settlement of a net investment hedge provided 9.1 million of cash in the first nine months of 2024. Investing cash flows in the first nine months of 2024 also reflect the Company s 10.0 million investment in a small South Carolina-based designer and manufacturer of sustainable protective packaging solutions. In the same period last year, the Company used 5.0 million of cash to purchase a 2.7 equity interest in Northstar Recycling Co. Net capital spending for 2024 is expected to be approximately 350 million to 375 million compared to 283 million in 2023. 
 Financing activities provided 1,529.5 million of cash in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024, compared with using 129.1 million of cash in the corresponding prior-year period. The primary driver of the 1,658.6 million year-over-year increase was higher proceeds from the issuance of debt net of repayments, which provided an additional 1,687.0 million of cash compared to the previous year. Significant activity in the current year includes 1,779.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in September 2024 intended to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the pending Eviosys acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, partially offset by repayments of the Company s syndicated term loan totaling 74.5 million. Other financing costs included 19.0 million in fees related to the Bridge Loan Facility (as defined below) obtained in connection with the pending Eviosys acquisition. Cash used to pay dividends increased by 4.9 million year over year reflecting the increase in the quarterly dividend payment from 0.51 per share to 0.52 per share approved by the Company s Board of Directors in April 2024. Cash used to repurchase the Company s common stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations in association with the exercise of certain share-based compensation awards was 9.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024, compared to 10.6 million in the same period last year. 
 During the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024, the Company reported a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 10.4 million due to currency translation adjustments resulting from a stronger U.S. d ollar relative to certain foreign currencies in which cash and cash equivalents were held.

 The C ompany s cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximatel y 117.1 million and 93.8 million, respectively, of the Company s reported cash and cash equivalents balances of 1.9 billion and 151.9 million, respectively, were held outside of the United States by its foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside of the U nited States is available to meet local liquidity needs or for capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other offshore growth opportunities. As the Company has maintained sufficient domestic liquidity through a combination of operating cash flow generation and access to bank and capital market borrowings, management has generally considered its foreign unremitted earnings to be indefinitely invested outside the United States and currently has no plans to repatriate such earnings, other than excess cash balances that can be repatriated at minimal tax cost. Accordingly, as of September 29, 2024, the Company is not providing for taxes on these amounts for financial reporting purposes. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with unremitted earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. 
 The Company uses a notional pooling arrangement with an international bank to help manage global liquidity requirements. Under this pooling arrangement, the Company and its participating subsidiaries may maintain either a cash deposit or borrowing position through local currency accounts with the bank, so long as the aggregate position of the global pool is a notionally calculated net cash deposit. Because it maintains a security interest in the cash deposits and has the right to offset the cash deposits against the borrowings, the bank provides the Company and its participating subsidiaries favorable interest terms on both the cash deposit and borrowing positions. 
 On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the sale of Protexic, part of the All Other group of businesses, to Black Diamond Capital Management, LLC for net cash proceeds of 80.3 million . The Company used the majority of these proceeds to pay down deb t. The Company believes that this and other potential divestitures will enable greater strategic clarity and operational focus while also generating proceeds to fund deleveraging and capital investments in core businesses. 
 On May 3, 2024, the Company increased the commitments under its unsecured revolving credit facility by 350 million to an aggregate amount of 1.25 billion and extended the maturity date to May 3, 2029, and also increased its 500 million commercial paper program by 750 million to 1.25 billion . The commercial paper program is supported by the Company s revolving credit facility. The Company has the contractual right to draw funds directly on the underlying revolving credit facility, which could possibly occur if there were a disruption in the commercial paper market. 
 On June 22, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Eviosys from an affiliate of KPS Capital Partners, LP for 3.6 billion (approximately 3.9 billion) on a cash-free and debt-free basis and subject to customary adjustments. In anticipation of closing on the Eviosys acquisition, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company took the following steps to secure the cash consideration for the acquisition and related fees and expenses: 
 In conjunction with the announcement of the acquisition of Eviosys, the Company entered into a commitment letter with certain financial institutions that provided for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility (the Bridge Loan Facility on June 22, 2024 in an aggregate amount of up to 4.0 billion. 
 On July 12, 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Term Credit Agreement ), providing the Company with the ability to borrow up to 700 million on an unsecured basis (the Term Loan Facility ). Funding of the Term Loan Facility is expected to occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the acquisition. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, net of any prepayments, will become payable in full on the second anniversary of the Funding Date (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement) and will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company s option, (i) the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate term rate (such borrowings, Term SOFR Loans ), (ii) a base rate, or (iii) a combination thereof, plus, in each case, an applicable margin calculated based on the Company s credit ratings and, in the of case of Term SOFR Loans, an adjustment of 10 basis points. 
 On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the 364-Day Term Credit Agreement ), providing the Company with the ability to borrow up to 1.5 billion on an unsecured basis (the 364-Day Term Loan Facility ). Funding of the 364-Day Term Loan Facility is expected to occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the acquisition. Borrowings under the 364-Day Term Loan Facility will bear interest under the same terms as the Term Loan Facility and will become payable in full 364 days following the funding date.

 On September 19, 2024, the Company completed a registered public offering of senior unsecured notes (the Notes in a combined aggregate principal amount of 1.8 billion . The Notes consisted of the following: 
 Principal Amount Issuance Costs and Discounts Net Proceeds Interest Rate Maturity 2026 Notes 500,000 (3,697) 496,303 4.450 September 1, 2026 2029 Notes 600,000 (5,851) 594,149 4.600 September 1, 2029 2034 Notes 700,000 (10,542) 689,458 5.000 September 1, 2034 Total 1,800,000 (20,090) 1,779,910 
 Cash and cash equivalents on hand at September 29, 2024 include 1.8 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, which are held in money market accounts. This cash is unrestricted but designated for use towards funding the pending acquisition of Eviosys. 
 As a result of obtaining financing for the Eviosys acquisition through the Term Loan Facility, the 364-Day Term Loan Facility, and the Notes, the Company terminated the commitments under the Bridge Loan Facility and the related commitment letter effective September 19, 2024. Fees related to the Bridge Loan Facility of 18.6 million and 19.0 million were amortized to interest expense during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024. 
 At September 29, 2024, the Company had scheduled debt maturities of approximately 482 million over the next twelve months, including 400 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.80 notes due February 2025. As the Company had 34.0 million in commercial paper balances outstanding at September 29, 2024, 1.2 billion in committed capacity under its revolving credit facility was available for draw down. The Company believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand, expected net cash flows generated from operating and investing activities, and expected proceeds from divestitures, together with proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes the Term Loan Agreement and 364-Day Term Credit Agreement, available capacity under the Company s increased borrowing arrangements, and the opportunity to raise additional capital through one or more capital markets transactions, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund the Eviosys acquisition and cover debt maturities and other cash flow needs of the Company over the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Certain of the Company s debt agreements impose restrictions with respect to the maintenance of financial ratios and the disposition of assets. The most restrictive covenants currently require the Company to maintain a minimum level of interest coverage and a minimum level of net worth, as defined in the agreements. As of September 29, 2024 , the Company s interest coverage and net worth were substantially above the minimum levels required under these covenants. 
 The Company continually explores strategic acquisition opportunities that may result in the use of cash. Given the nature of the acquisition process, the timing and amounts of such expenditures are not always predictable. The Company expects that any additional acquisitions requiring funding in excess of cash on hand would be financed using existing credit facilities or additional borrowings. 
 The Company anticipates making additional contributions to its other pension and postretirement plans of approximately 6 million durin g the remainder of 2024, resulting in expected total contributions to these plans of approximately 21 million in 2024. Future funding requirements beyond the current year will vary depending largely on investment performance, future actuarial assumptions, and legislative actions. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements, Foreign Exchange Exposure and Risk Management 
 Certain assets and liabilities are reported in the Company s financial statements at fair value, the fluctuation of which can impact the Company s financial position and results of operations. Items reported by the Company at fair value on a recurring basis include derivative contracts and pension-related assets. The valuation of the vast majority of these items is based either on quoted prices in active and accessible markets or on other observable inputs.

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 As a result of operating globally, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The exposure is well diversified, as the Company s facilities are located throughout the world, and the Company generally sells in the same countries where it produces with both revenue and costs transacted in the local currency. The Company monitors these exposures and uses foreign currency forward contracts and other risk management instruments to manage exposure to changes in foreign currency cash flows and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements by hedging a portion of forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency assets and liabilities, or its net investment in foreign subsidiaries. The Company s foreign operations are exposed to political, geopolitical, and cultural risks, but these risks are mitigated by diversification and the relative stability of the countries in which the Company has significant operations. 
 Because the economy in Venezuela is considered highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP, the Company considers the U.S. dollar to be the functional currency of its Venezuelan operations and uses the official exchange rate when remeasuring the financial results of those operations. Economic conditions in Venezuela have worsened considerably over the past several years and there are no indications that conditions are likely to improve in the foreseeable future. Further deterioration could result in the recognition of an impairment charge or a deconsolidation of the subsidiary. At September 29, 2024, the carrying value of the Company s net investment in its Venezuelan operations was approximately 2.1 million. In addition, at September 29, 2024, the Company s Accumulated other comprehensive loss included a cumulative translation loss of 3.8 million related to its Venezuelan operations which would need to be reclassified to net income in the event of a complete exit of the business or a deconsolidation of the Venezuelan operations. 
 Turkey has also been deemed to be a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP since the first quarter of 2022. Accordingly, the Company considers the U.S. dollar to be the functional currency of its operations in Turkey and has remeasured monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Turkish lira to U.S. dollars with changes recorded through earnings. The cumulative impact of applying highly inflationary accounting to Turk ey has been a pretax charge to earnings of 7.7 million 6.0 million after tax), including 1.2 million 1.0 million after tax) during th e nine-month period ended September 29, 2024. Th e magnitude of future earnings impacts, however, is uncertain as such impacts are dependent upon unpredictable movements in the Turkish lira relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to remeasurement-related charges, significant deterioration in the Turkish economy could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. However, the Company believes its exposure is limited to its net investment in Turkey which was approximat ely 22.6 million as of September 29, 2024. 
 The Company is a purchaser of various raw material inputs such as recovered paper, energy, steel, aluminum, and plastic resin. The Company generally does not engage in significant hedging activities for these purchases other than for energy and, from time to time, aluminum, because there is usually a high correlation between the primary input costs and the ultimate selling price of its products. Inputs are generally purchased at market or at fixed prices that are established with individual suppliers as part of the purchase process for quantities expected to be consumed in the ordinary course of business. On occasion, where the correlation between selling price and input price is less direct, the Company may enter into derivative contracts such as futures or swaps to manage the effect of price fluctuations. In addition, the Company may occasionally use traditional, unleveraged interest-rate swaps to manage its mix of fixed and variable rate debt and control its exposure to interest rate movements within select ranges. 
 At September 29, 2024, t he Company had derivative contracts outstanding to hedge the prices on a portion of anticipated natural gas and aluminum purchases. These contracts, some of which qualify as cash flow hedges, include natural gas swaps totaling approximately 7.3 million metric million British thermal units MMBTUs and aluminum swaps totaling 133 metric tons. These contracts have various maturity dates ranging through December 2025. The total fai r market value of these instruments resulted in a net loss position of 2.9 million and 6.8 million at September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company routinely enters into derivative currency contracts to mitigate the risk of unfavorable fluctuations in the exchange rate on certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows. These contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and have various maturity dates rangi n g through Decembe r 2024. T he total market value of these instruments resulted in a net loss position of 1.0 million at September 29, 2024 and a net gain position of 1.5 million at December 31, 2023. In addition, at September 29, 2024, the Company had various currency contracts outstanding to hedge the currency exposure of intercompany debt and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although placed as economic hedges, the Company does not apply hedge accounting to these instruments. As such, changes in fair value are recorded directly to income and expense in the periods that they occur. 
 In 2023, the Company became a party to cross-currency swap agreements with a total notional amount of 500 million to effectively convert a portion of the Company s fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt, including the semi-annual 
 63 

SONOCO PRODUCTS COMPANY 

 interest payments, to fixed-rate euro-denominated debt. The swap agreements, which had a maturity of December 18, 2026, provided for the Company to receive semi-annual interest payments in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate and to make semi-annual interest payments in euros at a fixed rate. The risk management objective of entering into the swap agreements was to manage foreign currency risk relating to net investments in certain European subsidiaries denominated in euros. The agreements were designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes. 
 The gain or loss on the net investment hedge derivative instruments is included in the Foreign currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the net investment is sold, diluted, or liquidated. Interest payments received for the cross-currency swaps are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in Interest expense in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of the cross-currency swaps are considered level 2 inputs, which are based upon the Euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate market. 
 On April 15, 2024, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, as well as a reduction in the differential between U.S. and European interest rates, the Company terminated its swap agreements and received a net cash settlement of 9.1 million. The foreign currency translation gain of approximately 3.1 million, net of tax, is included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 Following the unwind of the swaps, the Company entered into new cross-currency swap agreements with a total notional amount of 500 million to effectively convert a portion of the Company s fixed-rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt, including the semi-annual interest payments, to fixed-rate euro-denominated debt. The new swap agreements, which have a maturity of May 1, 2027, share the same risk management objective as the terminated cross-currency swap agreements and are also designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes. 
 The fair value of the Company s net investment hedges was a loss position of 18.9 million and 5.1 million at September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Translation losses of 14.1 million (net of income taxes of 4.8 million) and 3.8 million (net of income taxes of 1.3 million) were reported as components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss within Foreign currency items at September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 In anticipation of the offering of th e Notes, the Company entered into treasury lock derivative instruments with eleven banks, with a total notional principal amount of 900 million , on August 29, 2024. These instruments had the risk management objective of reducing the Company s exposure to increases in the underlying Treasury index up to the date of pricing of the Notes. The derivatives were settled when the Notes priced on September 17 , 2024, with the Company recognizing a loss on the settlement of (11.1) million . T he loss is included in Interest expense on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 . 
 The Company has an investment in preferred stock of a nonaffiliated private company that is accounted for under the measurement alternative of cost less impairment, adjusted for any qualifying observable price changes. Observable price changes would consist of Level 2 inputs based on privately negotiated transactions with the nonaffiliated company. The preferred stock balance of 21.2 million is included in Other assets in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2024 . 
 During the first nine months of 2024, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, and the Colombian peso, functional currencies in which a large amount of the Company s foreign investments are held. During this same period, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, the British pound, the Polish zloty, the Malaysian ringgit, and the Danish krone. The net impact of these changes, and the changes in the net investment hedge discussed above, resulted in translation losses of 20.4 million being recor ded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss during the nine-month period ended September 29, 2024.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment annually and from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units or the Company as a whole. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of that reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment charge to goodwill is recognized for the excess. The Company s reporting units, as determined in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, are the same as, or one level below, its operating segments, as determined in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. 
 The Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of 2024. For testing purposes, the Company performed an assessment of each reporting unit using either a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluations involved consideration of factors such as the macroeconomic environment, the industry, the Company s overall financial performance, the current and projected financial performance of specific reporting units, and business strategy changes. The quantitative tests, described further below, relied on management s long-term financial projections for the reporting units and took into consideration, among other things, specific business unit risk, the countries in which the reporting units operate, and implied fair values based on comparable trading multiples. 
 When performing a quantitative analysis, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighted average of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model based on projections of future years operating results and associated cash flows. The Company s assessments reflect significant management assumptions and estimates related to the Company s forecast of sales growth, gross profit margins and discount rates, which are validated by observed comparable trading and transaction multiples based on guideline public companies under the market approach. The Company s model discounts projected future cash flows, forecasted over a five-year period, with an estimated residual growth rate. The Company s projections incorporate management s estimates of the most-likely expected future results. Projected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a discount rate that management believes is appropriate for the reporting unit. 
 The Company s assessments, whether qualitative or quantitative, incorporate management s expectations for the future, including forecasted growth rates and/or margin improvements. Therefore, should there be changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and/or expectations, management s conclusions regarding goodwill impairment may change as well. 
 In considering the level of uncertainty regarding the potential for goodwill impairment, management has concluded that any such impairment would, in most cases, likely be the result of adverse changes in more than one assumption. Management considers the assumptions used to be its best estimates across a range of possible outcomes based on available evidence at the time of the assessment. Other than in the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food, and Metal Packaging reporting units, which are discussed below, there is no specific singular event or single change in circumstances management has identified that it believes could reasonably result in a change to the expected future results in any of its reporting units significant enough to result in goodwill impairment. In the case of Metal Packaging, t he lower differential between the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit is due to the acquisition of Ball Metalpack Holding, LLC in 2022, at which time the majority of assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at fair value. In management s opinion, a change of such magnitude would more likely be the result of changes to some combination of the factors identified above, a general deterioration in competitive position, introduction of a superior technology, significant unexpected changes in customer preferences, an inability to pass through significant raw material cost increases, and other such items as identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Although no reporting units failed the annual impairment test, in management s opinion the goodwill balances of the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food, and Metal Packaging reporting units are individually at risk of impairment in the near term if each reporting unit s operation does not perform in line with management s expectations, or if there is a negative change in the long-term financial outlook for each reporting unit or in other factors such as the particular discount rates used.

 Sensitivity Analysis 
 In the annual goodwill impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of 2024, projected future cash flows for the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food, and Metal Packaging reporting units were discounted at 11.5 , 10.5 , and 11.0 , respectively, and their estimated fair values were determined to exceed their carrying values by approximately 18.7 , 18.9 , and 12.6 , respectively . Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, the discount rates for the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food and Metal Packaging reporting units would have to increase t o 13.8 , 12.4 , and 12.1 , respectively, in order for the estimated fair values of the reporting units to fall below their individual carrying values. Total goodwill associated with the Plastics-Medical, Plastics-Food, and Metal Packaging reporting units was 64.9 million, 198.8 million , and 384.3 million , respectively, at September 29, 2024.

 Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that such controls and procedures, as of September 29, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. For this purpose, disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Information with respect to legal proceedings and other exposures appears in Part I - Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Part II - Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Note 17 - Commitments and contingencies in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Part I - Item 1 - Financial Statements (Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Environmental Matters 
 The Company has been named as a potentially responsible party PRP at several environmentally contaminated sites not owned by the Company. All of the sites are also the responsibility of other parties. The Company s liability, if any, is shared with such other parties, but the Company s share has not been finally determined in most cases. In some cases, the Company has cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs with respect to a particular site. Such agreements relate to the sharing of legal defense costs or cleanup costs, or both. The Company has assumed, for purposes of estimating amounts to be accrued, that the other parties to such cost-sharing agreements will perform as agreed. It appears that final resolution of some of the sites is years away, and actual costs to be incurred for these environmental matters in future periods is likely to vary from current estimates because of the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Accordingly, the ultimate cost to the Company with respect to such sites, beyond what has been accrued at September 29, 2024, cannot be determined. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued 6.9 million and 7.3 million, respectively, related to environmental contingencies. The Company periodically reevaluates the assumptions used in determining the appropriate reserves for environmental matters as additional information becomes available and, when warranted, makes appropriate adjustments.
