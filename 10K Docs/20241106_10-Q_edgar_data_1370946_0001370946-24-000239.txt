As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, amounts due to the related party supplier were million and million, respectively. 
 Supplier Finance Programs 
 We review supplier terms and conditions on an ongoing basis, and have negotiated payment terms extensions in recent years in connection with our efforts to reduce working capital and improve cash flow. Separate from those terms extension actions, certain of our subsidiaries have entered into paying agency agreements with third-party administrators. These voluntary supply chain finance programs (collectively, the Programs generally give participating suppliers the ability to sell, or otherwise pledge as collateral, their receivables from the Company to the participating financial institutions, at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and financial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the financial institutions. The Company s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the suppliers decisions to sell, or otherwise pledge as collateral, amounts under these arrangements. The Company s payment terms to the financial institutions, including the timing and amount of payments, are based on the original supplier invoices. One of the Programs includes a parent guarantee to the participating financial institution for a certain U.S. subsidiary that, at the time of the respective program s inception in 2015, was a guarantor subsidiary of the Company s Credit Agreement. 
 The obligations are presented as Accounts payable within Total current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and all activity related to the obligations is presented within operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. 
 The Company s confirmed outstanding obligations under the Programs totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The amounts of invoices paid under the Programs totaled million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Strategic Actions 
 On February 9, 2024, the Company announced the decision to review strategic alternatives for its global glass reinforcements GR business, consistent with our strategy to focus on building and construction materials. The GR business, which operates within our Composites segment, supplies a wide variety of glass fiber products for applications in wind energy, infrastructure, industrial, transportation, and consumer markets. The GR business generates annual revenues of approximately billion. While a range of options are under consideration, including a potential sale, spin-off or other strategic option, there can be no assurance that the strategic review will result in any transaction or other outcome. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company incurred million of costs related to this review. 
 
 Accounting Policies 
 There have been no changes in the significant accounting policies from those that were disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except as follows:

sites worldwide, including Superfund and state or country equivalent sites and owned or formerly owned sites. None of the liabilities for these sites are individually significant to the Company. 
 Remediation activities generally involve a potential range of activities and costs related to soil, groundwater, and sediment contamination. This can include pre-cleanup activities such as fact-finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility studies, remedial action design and implementation (where actions may range from monitoring to removal of contaminants, to installation of longer-term remediation systems). A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the number of parties involved in a particular site, the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time the remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations, variability in clean-up standards, the need for legal action, and changes in remediation technology. Taking these factors into account, Owens Corning reasonably estimates the costs of remediation to be paid over a period of years. The Company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis, when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable. Actual cost may differ from these estimates for the reasons mentioned above. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accrual totaling million for these costs, of which the current portion is million. Changes in required remediation procedures or timing of those procedures, or discovery of contamination at additional sites, could result in material increases to the Company s environmental obligations. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Procuradur a Federal de Protecci n al Ambiente PROFEPA issued a ruling to Owens Corning Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a subsidiary of the Company OC Mexico ), citing violations of Mexico s air emissions regulations at OC Mexico s facility in Mexico City, Mexico and imposing monetary sanctions of approximately million. OC Mexico previously performed all related corrective action and, as of the date of this report, is in compliance with applicable federal and local environmental laws. OC Mexico is in the process of appealing PROFEPA s ruling and the resulting monetary sanctions.

 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted both internal company-based and external-based metric PSUs. 
 Internal Company-based metrics 
 The internal Company-based metric PSUs are based on various Company metrics and typically vest after a period. The amount of stock distributed will vary from to of PSUs awarded depending on each award s design and performance versus the company-based metrics. 
 The initial fair value for all internal company-based metric PSUs assumes that the performance goals will be achieved and is based on the grant date stock price. This assumption is monitored quarterly and if it becomes probable that such goals will not be achieved or will be exceeded, compensation expense recognized will be adjusted and previous surplus compensation expense recognized will be reversed or additional expense will be recognized. The expected term represents the period from the grant date to the end of the performance period. Pro-rata vesting may be utilized in the case of death, disability or retirement and awards, if earned, will be paid at the end of the period.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 This Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is intended to help investors understand Owens Corning, our operations and our present business environment. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes thereto contained in this report. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms Owens Corning, Company, we and our in this report refer to Owens Corning and its subsidiaries. 
 
 GENERAL 
 Owens Corning is a residential and commercial building products leader committed to building a sustainable future through material innovation. The Company has four reporting segments: Roofing, Insulation, Doors and Composites. Through these lines of business, the Company manufactures and sells products worldwide. We are a market leader in many of our major product categories. 
 
 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 Net earnings attributable to Owens Corning were 321 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 337 million in the same period of 2023. The Company generated 582 million in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes Adjusted EBIT for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 518 million in the same period of 2023. See the Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes paragraph of the MD A for further information regarding Adjusted EBIT, including the reconciliation to net earnings attributable to Owens Corning. Third quarter of 2024 earnings before interest and taxes EBIT performance compared to the same period of 2023 increased 16 million and 33 million in our Roofing and Insulation segments, respectively, and decreased 19 million in our Composites segment. Third quarter of 2024 EBIT for our Doors segment was 36 million. Within our Corporate, Other and Eliminations category, General corporate expense and other increased by 2 million. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 499 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1,323 million as of September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s operating activities provided 1,216 million of cash, compared to providing 1,021 million of cash in the same period in 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s investing activities used 3,193 million of cash, compared to using 219 million of cash in the same period in 2023. 
 On May 15, 2024, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Masonite International Corporation Masonite ), a leading global designer, manufacturer, marketer and distributor of interior and exterior doors and door systems, for 3.2 billion. The acquisition was funded primarily with debt proceeds from the 364-Day Credit Facility (as defined below) of 2.8 billion and cash on hand. The acquisition of Masonite's market-leading doors business creates a new growth platform for the Company, strengthening the Company's position in building and construction and expanding its offering of branded residential building products. Masonite's operating results and preliminary purchase price allocation have been included in the Company's newly established Doors reportable segment from May 15, 2024, within the Consolidated Financial Statements. Masonite contributed revenues of 573 million and 884 million and EBIT of 36 million and 70 million to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company entered into a term loan agreement in an aggregate principal amount of 3.0 billion (the 364-Day Credit Facility ). In May 2024, to fund a portion of the purchase of Masonite, the Company borrowed 2.8 billion using Term SOFR plus a spread on the 364-Day Credit Facility. As a result of the borrowing, the Company incurred approximately 16 million of financing fees which were amortized to Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the quarter, the Company completely repaid the 364-Day Credit Facility with a combination of issuance of new senior notes, borrowings on the receivables securitization and cash on hand. Based on terms of the agreement, no further amounts can be drawn. 
 On May 15, 2024, the Company initially borrowed 295 million under the receivables securitization facility Receivables Securitization Facility which was used to pay down a portion of the 364-Day Credit Facility. Subsequent to the May 15, 2024 borrowing, the Company repaid and re-borrowed on the Receivables Securitization Facility throughout the second and third quarter of 2024 to pay down portions of the 364-Day Credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, there is no outstanding balance on the Receivables Securitization Facility.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 On May 31, 2024, the Company issued 500 million of 2027 senior notes with an annual interest rate of 5.500 , 800 million of 2034 senior notes with an annual interest rate of 5.700 and 700 million of 2054 senior notes with an annual interest rate of 5.950 . These senior notes are net of discounts and issuance costs of 4 million, 11 million and 17 million, respectively. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Facility that was used to fund a portion of the purchase of Masonite in the second quarter of 2024 and to pay related fees and expenses. 
 On May 1, 2024, in connection with the acquisition of Masonite, we commenced an offer to exchange (the Exchange Offer any and all of Masonite s outstanding 3.50 Senior Notes due 2030 (the Masonite 2030 notes for new 3.50 Senior Notes due 2030 of Owens Corning (the Owens Corning 2030 notes ). On May 22, 2024, 99.51 of the outstanding Masonite 2030 notes were exchanged and we issued 373 million of aggregate principal amount of Owens Corning 2030 notes. Following the settlement of the Exchange Offer, approximately 2 million of the Masonite 2030 notes that were not exchanged remain outstanding, which has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 On April 15, 2024, in connection with the acquisition of Masonite, we commenced a tender offer (the Tender Offer to purchase any and all of Masonite's outstanding 5.375 Senior Notes due 2028 (the Masonite 2028 notes with an aggregate value of 501 million. On May 13, 2024, 94.25 of the outstanding Masonite 2028 notes were validly tendered, with Owens Corning making a cash payment on May 16, 2024 of approximately 480 million, inclusive of 7 million of interest and 1 million premium on tender. Following the settlement of the Tender Offer, approximately 29 million of the Masonite 2028 notes that were not tendered remain outstanding, which has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 On February 9, 2024, the Company announced the decision to review strategic alternatives for its global glass reinforcements GR business, consistent with our strategy to focus on building and construction materials. The GR business, which operates within our Composites segment, supplies a wide variety of glass fiber products for applications in wind energy, infrastructure, industrial, transportation, and consumer markets. The GR business generates annual revenues of approximately 1.3 billion. While a range of options are under consideration, including a potential sale, spin-off or other strategic option, there can be no assurance that the strategic review will result in any transaction or other outcome. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company incurred 33 million of costs related to this review. 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Company s subsidiary, Paroc Group OY Paroc ), which the Company acquired in 2018, notified the appropriate European maritime regulatory authorities that specific products in its marine insulation product line may not meet certain fire safety requirements in accordance with their certifications. Paroc voluntarily withdrew these specific products from the market, issued recalls, and suspended distribution and sales of these products (the Recalled Products ). Paroc continues to cooperate with the applicable regulatory and government authorities and work with its customers and end-users to assist with remediation for the recall. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company discovered potential nonconformances relating to two other marine insulation product lines. In April 2024, Paroc suspended sales of these marine insulation products as a precautionary measure while it reviews the potential nonconformances, but has not issued recalls. The Company has included an estimated liability for expected future costs related to the Recalled Products on its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As part of its review of the Paroc insulation product portfolio, the Company discovered potential nonconformances relating to certain ventilation duct and steel beam insulation products. In January and September 2024, Paroc suspended sales of the affected insulation products as a precautionary measure while it reviews the potential nonconformances, but has not issued recalls. We expect to incur costs associated with the resolution of this matter. The amount or range of any potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The Company is continuing its review. 
 On December 1, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of 10 million shares of the Company s outstanding common stock (the Repurchase Authorization ). The Repurchase Authorization enables the Company to repurchase shares through the open market, privately negotiated, or other transactions. The actual number of shares repurchased will depend on timing, market conditions and other factors and will be at the Company s discretion. The Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock for 202 million, inclusive of applicable taxes, in the third quarter of 2024 under the Repurchase Authorization. As of September 30, 2024, 6.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under the Repurchase Authorization.

 The Consolidated Results discussion below provides a summary of our results and the trends affecting our business, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed Segment Results discussion that follows. 
 NET SALES 
 In the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, net sales increased 567 million and increased 762 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the revenues from our Doors segment as a result of the Masonite acquisition, higher selling prices and favorable product mix, which was partially offset by lower sales volumes. 
 GROSS MARGIN 
 In the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, gross margin increased 181 million and increased 387 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the third quarter and year to date 2024, the increase was primarily driven by the margins from our Doors segment as a result of the Masonite acquisition. Also contributing to the increase were higher selling prices, slightly offset by lower sales volumes. 
 MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
 In the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, marketing and administrative expenses increased 78 million and increased 128 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, the increase was primarily driven by the addition of the Doors segment selling, general and administrative expenses and ongoing inflationary pressures throughout the organization. 
 GAIN ON SALE OF SITE 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the sale of the Company s Insulation site in Santa Clara, California resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of 189 million.

 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
 In the third quarter and year-to-date 2024, interest expense, net, increased 53 million and increased 89 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. For the third quarter, the increase was driven by interest on the higher long-term debt balances in connection with the Masonite acquisition and lower interest income. For year-to-date, the increase was driven by higher interest on the 364-Day Credit Facility and higher long-term debt balances in connection with the Masonite acquisition. 
 INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 120 million and 318 million, respectively. For the third quarter of 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s effective tax rate was 27 and 26 , respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to U.S. state and local income tax expense, foreign rate differential and U.S. federal taxes on foreign earnings. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on achieving a certain minimum level of future taxable income. Management currently believes that it is not reasonably possible that the minimum level of taxable income will be met within the next 12 months to reduce the valuation allowances of certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 110 million and 361 million, respectively. For the third quarter of 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's effective tax rate was 25 . The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to U.S. state and local income tax expense, offset slightly by U.S. federal taxes on foreign earnings and U.S. federal income tax credits. The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to U.S. state and local income tax expense and foreign rate differential.

 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes 
 Adjusted EBIT is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain items that management does not allocate to our segment results because it believes they are not representative of the Company s ongoing operations. Adjusted EBIT is used internally by the Company for various purposes, including reporting results of operations to the Board of Directors of the Company, analysis of performance and related employee compensation measures. Although management believes that these adjustments result in a measure that provides a useful representation of our operational performance, the adjusted measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Net earnings attributable to Owens Corning as prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 Adjusting income (expense) items to EBIT are shown in the table below (in millions):

 Segment Results 
 EBIT by segment consists of net sales less related costs and expenses and is presented on a basis that is used internally for evaluating segment performance. Certain items, such as general corporate expenses or income and certain other expense or income items, are excluded from the internal evaluation of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not reflected in EBIT for our reportable segments and are included in the Corporate, Other and Eliminations category, which is presented following the discussion of our reportable segments. 
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA by segment is a non-GAAP measure that consists of EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. Segment EBITDA is used internally by the Company for analysis of performance.

 NET SALES 
 In our Roofing segment, net sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 6 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to lower sales volumes of approximately 7 which more than offset higher selling prices of 42 million and favorable product mix. 
 For year-to-date 2024, net sales in our Roofing segment increased 38 million compared to the same period in 2023. Lower sales volumes of approximately 6 were more than offset by higher selling prices of 129 million and favorable product mix. 
 EBIT 
 In our Roofing segment, EBIT in the third quarter of 2024 increased 16 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher selling prices of 42 million and favorable product mix which were slightly offset by lower sales volumes and 9 million of higher manufacturing costs. Favorable delivery of 5 million was more than offset by input cost inflation. 
 For year-to-date 2024, EBIT in our Roofing segment increased 128 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher selling prices of 129 million, favorable product mix and 15 million of lower manufacturing costs, which were slightly offset by lower sales volumes. Favorable delivery of 15 million was more than offset by input cost inflation. 
 OUTLOOK 
 In our Roofing segment, the Company expects residential repair and remodeling activity to remain solid. Other uncertainties that may impact Roofing demand include demand from storms and other weather-related events, competitive pricing pressure and the cost and availability of raw materials, particularly asphalt. The Company will continue to focus on managing costs, capital expenditures and working capital to best service the market demand.

 NET SALES 
 In our Insulation segment, net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 33 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher selling prices of 29 million and favorable product mix, slightly offset by unfavorable customer mix. 
 For year-to-date 2024, net sales in our Insulation segment increased 29 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher selling prices of 53 million and favorable product mix partially offset by lower sales volumes of approximately 2 . 
 EBIT 
 In our Insulation segment, EBIT in the third quarter of 2024 increased 33 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily driven by higher selling prices of 29 million. Higher manufacturing costs of 7 million were more than offset by lower production downtime of 6 million and lower start-up costs, while favorable delivery of 8 million more than offset higher operating expenses. 
 For the year-to-date 2024, EBIT in our Insulation segment increased 58 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by higher selling prices of 53 million, favorable delivery of 25 million, and lower start-up costs which more than offset higher manufacturing costs of 16 million, higher operating expenses, inclusive of incremental costs associated with evaluating manufacturing investments, and lower sales volumes. The remaining variance was driven by favorable product mix which more than offset unfavorable customer mix. 
 OUTLOOK 
 The outlook for Insulation demand is driven by North American new residential construction and remodeling and repair activity, as well as commercial and industrial construction activity in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Demand in commercial and industrial insulation markets is most closely correlated to industrial production growth and overall economic activity in the global markets we serve. Demand for residential insulation is most closely correlated to U.S. housing starts. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the average Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate SAAR of U.S. housing starts was approximately 1.326 million, down from an annual average of approximately 1.359 million starts in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The Company expects the new residential construction market in North America to be temporarily challenged as the market starts to return to a more normal seasonal pattern, while the North America commercial and industrial construction markets are expected to remain stable. However, due to a period of slow economic growth, the global commercial and industrial construction markets are expected to remain soft temporarily. The Company continues to concentrate on managing costs, capital expenditures and working capital as we evaluate options to expand capacity within our existing manufacturing network.

 In our newly acquired Doors segment, EBIT in the third quarter and year-to-date 2024 were 36 million and 70 million, respectively, due to the acquisition of Masonite, which was completed on May 15, 2024. 
 OUTLOOK 
 The outlook for the Doors segment is driven by the residential new construction and residential repair and remodeling markets in North America and Europe. The Company expects the North America residential new construction market to be temporarily challenged, with discretionary residential repair and remodeling activity in North America to remain soft. Due to a weaker macroeconomic outlook and higher interest rates in Europe, the Company expects these markets to remain challenged. The Company will concentrate on managing costs, capital expenditures and working capital.

 EBIT 
 In Corporate, Other and Eliminations, EBIT expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were higher by 20 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by higher acquisition-related and strategic review-related costs, partially offset by gains on sales of precious metals and lower year over year restructuring charges. For year-to-date 2024, EBIT expenses in Corporate, Other and Eliminations were higher by 322 million primarily driven by the prior-year pre-tax gain on the Santa Clara, California site, as well as higher acquisition-related and strategic review-related costs. 
 General corporate expense and other for the third quarter of 2024 were higher by 2 million compared to the same period in 2023. 
 For year-to-date, general corporate expense and other were higher by 13 million compared to the same period in 2023. 
 OUTLOOK

 Senior Revolving Credit Facility Receivables Securitization Facility Facility size or borrowing limit 1,000 300 Collateral capacity limitation on availability N/A Outstanding borrowings Outstanding letters of credit 4 1 Availability on facility 996 299 
 The Receivables Securitization Facility and Senior Revolving Credit Facility mature in February 2025 and March 2029, respectively. The agreements governing our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facility contain various covenants that we believe are usual and customary. These covenants include a maximum allowed leverage ratio. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.5 billion of total debt. The Company's current portion of long-term debt includes 400 million of 4.200 senior notes due in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company borrowed 2.8 billion using Term SOFR plus a spread on the 364-Day Credit Facility to fund a portion of the purchase of Masonite. As a result of the borrowing, the Company incurred approximately 16 million of financing fees which were amortized to Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the second quarter, the Company completely repaid the 364-Day Credit Facility with a combination of issuance of new senior notes, borrowings on the Receivables Securitization Facility and cash on hand. Based on terms of the agreement, no further amounts can be drawn. 
 On April 15, 2024, in connection with the acquisition of Masonite, we commenced the Tender Offer to purchase any and all of Masonite's outstanding 5.375 Senior Notes due 2028 (the Masonite 2028 notes with an aggregate value of 501 million. On May 13, 2024, 94.25 of the outstanding Masonite 2028 notes were validly tendered, with Owens Corning making a cash payment on May 16, 2024 of approximately 480 million, inclusive of 7 million of interest and 1 million premium on tender. Following the settlement of the Tender Offer, approximately 29 million of the Masonite 2028 notes that were not tendered remain outstanding, which has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest on the Masonite 2028 notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 each year. 
 On May 1, 2024, in connection with the acquisition of Masonite, we commenced the Exchange Offer, exchanging any and all of Masonite s outstanding 3.50 Senior Notes due 2030 for new 3.50 Senior Notes due 2030 of Owens Corning. On May 22, 2024, 99.51 of the outstanding Masonite 2030 notes were exchanged and we issued 373 million of aggregate principal amount of Owens Corning 2030 notes. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year, beginning on August 15, 2024. Following the settlement of the Exchange Offer, approximately 2 million of the Masonite 2030 notes that were not exchanged remain outstanding, which has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company issued 500 million of 2027 senior notes with an annual interest rate of 5.500 , 800 million of 2034 senior notes with an annual interest rate of 5.700 and 700 million of 2054 senior notes with an annual interest rate of 5.950 on May 31, 2024. These senior notes are net of discounts and issuance costs of 4 million, 11 million and 17 million, respectively. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Facility that was used to fund a portion of the purchase of Masonite in the second quarter of 2024 and to pay related fees and expenses. 
 Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation to the U.S. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had 129 million and 114 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company continues to assert indefinite reinvestment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740 based on the laws as of enactment of the tax legislation.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

 As a holding company, we have no operations of our own and most of our assets are held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Dividends and other payments or distributions from our subsidiaries will be used to meet our debt service and other obligations and to enable us to pay dividends to our stockholders. Please refer to the Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K for details on the factors that could inhibit our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to the parent company. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Our anticipated uses of cash include capital expenditures, working capital needs, share repurchases, meeting financial obligations, payments of any dividends authorized by our Board of Directors, acquisitions, restructuring actions and pension contributions. We expect that our cash on hand, coupled with future cash flows from operations and other available sources of liquidity, including our Senior Revolving Credit Facility and our Receivables Securitization Facility, will provide ample liquidity to enable us to meet our cash requirements. 
 Please refer to Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our 2023 Form 10-K for more details on these material cash requirements. During the third quarter of 2024, there have been no material changes to our expected uses of cash and contractual obligations. 
 Supplier Finance Programs 
 We review supplier terms and conditions on an ongoing basis, and have negotiated payment terms extensions in recent years in connection with our efforts to reduce working capital and improve cash flow. Separate from those terms extension actions, certain of our subsidiaries have entered into paying agency agreements with third-party administrators. These voluntary supply chain finance programs (collectively, the Programs generally give participating suppliers the ability to sell, or otherwise pledge as collateral, their receivables from the Company to the participating financial institutions, at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and financial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the financial institutions. The Company s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the suppliers decisions to sell, or otherwise pledge as collateral, amounts under these arrangements. The Company s payment terms to the financial institutions, including the timing and amount of payments, are based on the original supplier invoices. One of the Programs includes a parent guarantee to the participating financial institution for a certain U.S. subsidiary that, at the time of the respective program s inception in 2015, was a guarantor subsidiary of the Company s credit agreement. The obligations are presented as Accounts payable within Total current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and all activity related to the obligations is presented within operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. 
 The desire of suppliers and financial institutions to participate in the Programs could be negatively impacted by, among other factors, the availability of capital committed by the participating financial institutions, the cost and availability of our suppliers capital, a credit rating downgrade or deteriorating financial performance of the Company or its participating subsidiaries, or other changes in financial markets beyond our control. We do not expect these risks, or potential long-term growth of our Programs, to materially affect our overall financial condition, as we expect a significant portion of our payments to continue to be made outside of the Programs. Accordingly, we do not believe the Programs have materially impacted our current period liquidity, and do not believe that the Programs are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity in the future. 
 Please refer to the Supplier Finance Programs section in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of outstanding obligations and payments under the supplier finance programs.

 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash balance, cash flows, and availability on credit facilities (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 499 1,323 Net cash flow provided by operating activities 1,216 1,021 Net cash flow used for investing activities (3,193) (219) Net cash flow provided by (used for) financing activities 901 (585) Availability on the Senior Revolving Credit Facility 996 796 Availability on the Receivables Securitization Facility 299 279 
 Operating activities : Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by 195 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower decreases in accounts payable and higher decreases in inventory when compared to the same period in 2023. These were slightly offset by lower decreases in accounts receivable during the period. 
 Investing activities: Net cash flow used for investing activities increased by 3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the Masonite acquisition and lower proceeds from sale of assets in 2024 due to the Q1 2023 sale of the Santa Clara site. 
 Financing activities: Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased by 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by net proceeds from long-term debt related to the Masonite acquisition, as well as lower treasury stock repurchases. These were slightly offset by payments related to the Tender Offer to purchase Masonite senior notes. 
 Derivatives 
 Please refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Fair Value Measurement 
 Please refer to Notes 4, 7, 11, and 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 SAFETY 
 One of our primary objectives is the safety and well-being of our employees. Working safely is an unconditional, organization-wide expectation at Owens Corning, which we believe directly benefits employees lives, improves our manufacturing processes and reduces our costs. The Company maintains comprehensive safety programs focused on identifying hazards and eliminating risks that can lead to severe injuries. One of our primary safety measures is the Recordable Incident Rate RIR as defined by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our RIR excluding the impact from our Doors segment as a result of the Masonite acquisition, was 0.58, compared to 0.66 as reported in the same period a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our RIR excluding the impact from our Doors segment as a result of the Masonite acquisition, was 0.47 compared to 0.65 as reported in the same period a year ago.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Goodwill Impairment Indicator Assessment 
 The Company tests goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently should circumstances change or events occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company performed its quarterly assessment to identify potential indicators of impairment for each of its reporting units. Among qualitative and quantitative factors considered, management reviewed key assumptions and information, including updated macroeconomic indicators that impact the markets we serve, and financial forecast information for each reporting unit. The annual impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 indicated that the business enterprise value of the Composites reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 . Given this narrow cushion of Composites reporting unit fair value in excess of carrying value and the ongoing strategic review of the glass reinforcements business, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2024 for the Composites reporting unit. 
 As a result of this test, we determined that no impairment existed for the reporting unit. Testing indicated that the business enterprise value for the Composites reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than . There is uncertainty as to the outcome of the strategic review of our glass reinforcements business and the macroeconomic factors that impact this reporting unit. The likelihood of a future impairment could be increased by a sustained downturn in these macroeconomic factors, a change in the long-term revenue growth or profitability for this reporting unit, or the outcome of the strategic review. The most significant assumptions used in our analysis to determine the fair value of the Composites reporting unit are the discount rate, the long-term growth rate and profitability of the reporting unit. If all other assumptions remain constant, a 50 basis point increase in the selected discount rate of 10 would decrease the fair value of the Composites reporting unit by approximately 3 , a 50 basis point decrease in the selected long-term growth rate of 2.5 would decrease the fair value of the Composites reporting unit by approximately 2 , and a 50 basis point decrease in forecasted annual EBIT margins would decrease the fair value of Composites by approximately 2 . 
 The following table summarizes the segment allocation of recorded goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 (in millions):

 During the first three quarters of 2024, the Company performed its quarterly assessment to identify any potential impairment indicators for each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets. Among qualitative and quantitative factors considered, management reviewed key assumptions and information, including updated macroeconomic indicators that impact the markets we serve and financial forecast information for each reporting unit. After evaluating and weighing all relevant events and circumstances, the Company did not identify any impairment indicators for any of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of any of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective fair values. Consequently, we determined that it was not necessary to perform an interim impairment test for any indefinite-lived intangible assets.. 
 
 There are indefinite-lived intangible assets that are at an increased risk of impairment, both of which are used by our Insulation segment and were partially impaired in the fourth quarter of 2022. A change in the estimated long-term revenue growth rate or discount rate for the segment could increase the likelihood of a future impairment. The following table presents the carrying values of these assets as of September 30, 2024: 
 Trademarks and trade names September 30, 2024 European building and technical insulation trade name 
 Global cellular glass insulation trademark 
 Long-lived Asset Recoverability Assessment 
 There were no changes to the recoverability conclusions for our long-lived assets disclosed in our 2023 Form-10-K. Changes in management intentions, market conditions, operating performance and other similar circumstances could affect the assumptions used in these impairment tests. Changes in the assumptions could result in impairment charges that could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements in any given period.

AGREEMENT, effective as of ____________ between Owens Corning, a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and ________ (the Indemnitee ). 
 
 WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors the most capable persons available 
 
 WHEREAS, Indemnitee is a director of the Company 
 
 WHEREAS, both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted against directors of public companies in today's environment 
 
 WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the Company (the Bylaws require the Company to indemnify and advance expenses to its directors to the full extent permitted by law and the Indemnitee has agreed to serve as a director of the Company in part in reliance on such Bylaws 
 
 WHEREAS, in recognition of Indemnitee's need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee's continued service to the Company in an effective manner and Indemnitee's reliance on the Bylaws, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that the protection promised by such Bylaws will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of such Bylaws or any change in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors or acquisition transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the full extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at its request, with another enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows 
 
 1. Certain Definitions 
 
 (a) Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20 or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, or (ii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2 3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof, or (iii) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the Voting Securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into Voting Securities of the surviving entity) at least 80 of the total 

voting power represented by the Voting Securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. 
 
 (b) Claim any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether conducted by the Company or any other party, that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other. 
 
 (c) Expenses include attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in any Claim relating to any Indemnifiable Event. 
 
 (d) Indemnifiable Event any event or occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity. 
 
 (e) Potential Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) the Company enters into an agreement or arrangement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change in Control (ii) any person (including the Company) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions which if consummated would constitute a Change in Control (iii) any person, other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company acting in such capacity or a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, who is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 10 or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, increases his beneficial ownership of such securities by 5 or more over the percentage so owned by such person on the date hereof or (iv) the Board adopts a resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this Agreement, a Potential Change in Control has occurred. 
 
 (f) Reviewing Party any appropriate person or body consisting of a member or members of the Company's Board of Directors or any other person or body appointed by the Board (including the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3) who is not a party to the particular claim for which Indemnitee is seeking indemnification. 
 
 (g) Voting Securities any securities of the Company which vote generally in the election of directors. 
 
 2. Indemnification Arrangement . 
 
 (a) In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in a Claim by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent authorized by the Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof notwithstanding that such Bylaws may subsequently be amended, repealed or otherwise changed in any respect, as soon as practicable but in any event no later than thirty 
 2 

days after written demand is presented to the Company, against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) of such Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to a Change in Control, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Claim initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the initiation of such Claim. If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance (within two business days of such request) any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (an Expense Advance ). The Indemnitee shall qualify for such Expense Advance upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement, which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts paid (without interest) by the Company pursuant to this Section 2, if and only to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. No other form of undertaking shall be required other than the execution of this Agreement. 
 
 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the obligations of the Company under Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition that the Reviewing Party shall not have determined (in a written opinion, in any case in which the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof is involved) that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, and (ii) the obligation of the Company to make an Expense Advance pursuant to Section 2(a) shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid provided, however, that if Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed). If there has not been a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and if there has been such a Change in Control, the Reviewing Party shall be the special, independent counsel referred to in Section 3 hereof. If there has been no determination by the Reviewing Party or if the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof, and the Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding. Any determination by the Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and Indemnitee. 
 
 3. Change in Control . The company agrees that if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) then with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or By-Law now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from special, independent counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed services for the Company within the last 5 years (other than in connection with such matters) or Indemnitee. Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the special, independent counsel referred to above and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorney's fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto. 
 
 4. Establishment of Trust . In the event of a Potential Change in Control, the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee, create a Trust for the benefit of the Indemnitee and, from time to 
 3 

time upon written request of Indemnitee, shall fund such Trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of each such request to be incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for and defending any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event, and any and all judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts of any and all Claims relating to an Indemnifiable Event from time to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be paid. The amount or amounts to be deposited in the Trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by the Reviewing Party, in any case in which the special, independent counsel referred to above is involved. The terms of the Trust shall provide that upon a Change in Control (i) the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of the Indemnitee, (ii) the Trustee shall advance, within two business days of a request by the Indemnitee, any and all expenses to the Indemnitee (and the Indemnitee hereby agrees to reimburse the Trust under the circumstances under which the Indemnitee would be required to reimburse the Company under Section 2(b) of this Agreement), (iii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by the Company in accordance with the funding obligation set forth above, (iv) the Trustee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitee all amounts for which the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and (v) all unexpended funds in such Trust shall revert to the Company upon a final determination by the Reviewing Party or a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may be, that the Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the terms of this Agreement. The Trustee shall be chosen by the Indemnitee. Nothing in this Section 4 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement. 
 
 5. Indemnification for Additional Expenses . The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within two business days of such request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or action brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or By-Law now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and or (ii) recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be. 
 
 6. Partial Indemnity, Etc . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith. In connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled. 
 
 7. No Presumption . For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law. 
 
 8. Non-exclusivity, Etc . The rights of the Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Bylaws or the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise. To the extent that a change in the Delaware General Corporation Law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. 
 
 4 

9. Liability Insurance . To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any Company director or officer. 
 
 10. Amendments, Etc . No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. 
 
 11. Subrogation . In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
 
 12. No Duplication of Payments . The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, By-Law or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. 
 
 13. Binding Effect, Etc . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives. The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business and or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director of the Company or of any other enterprise at the Company's request. 
 
 14. Severability . The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
 
 15. Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such State , including its applicable statute of limitations, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.
