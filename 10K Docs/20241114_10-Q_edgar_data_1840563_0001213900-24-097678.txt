facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. These statements appear in several different places in this Quarterly Report and,
in some cases, can be identified by words such as anticipates, estimates, projects, expects, 
 contemplates, intends, believes, plans, may, will 
or their negatives or other comparable words, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report may include, but are not limited to, statements and/or information related to: our financial performance

We have based these
forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events on information that is available as of the date of this Quarterly
Report, and any forward-looking statements made by us speak only as of the date on which they are made. While we believe these expectations
are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.
Our actual future results may differ materially from those discussed or implied in our forward-looking statements for various reasons,
including, our ability to change the direction of the Company; our ability to keep pace with new technology and changing market needs;
our capital needs, and the competitive environment of our business. Additional Factors that could contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to:

prices of other competitive
 products, costs associated with research and development of our products and other economic conditions; 

the effect of an outbreak

 including the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic); 

the impact of political

 to raise sufficient funds to carry out its proposed business plan; 

inability to keep up with
 advances in medical aesthetics and biotechnology; 

inability to design, develop,
 market and sell new medical aesthetics and biotech products that address additional market opportunities to generate revenue and
 positive cash flows; 

dependency on certain key
 personnel and any inability to retain and attract qualified personnel; 

inability to succeed in
 establishing, maintaining and strengthening the Elevai brand; 

our expectations regarding
 our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing, misappropriating,
 or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others; 

disruption of supply or
 shortage of raw materials; 

the unavailability, reduction
 or elimination of government and economic incentives; 

failure to manage future
 growth effectively; and 

the other risks and uncertainties
 detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including but not limited
 to those described under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as amended
 for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). 

Although management
has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking
statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There is no assurance that
forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated
in such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. These cautionary
remarks expressly qualify, in their entirety, all forward-looking statements attributable to our Company or persons acting on our Company s
behalf. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in
other factors affecting such statements, except as, and to the extent required by, applicable securities laws.

Management s plans that alleviate
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include raising additional debt or equity financing.
Although the Company has been successful in raising funds in the past, and expects to do so in the future, there are no guarantees that
it will be able to raise funds as anticipated.

Liabilities from Equity, and determined that the warrants should be classified as financial liabilities.

that the warrants be accounted for as derivative liabilities with initial and subsequent measurement at fair value with changes in fair
value recorded as other income (expense).

We determined our derivative liabilities

or strike price, expected time to expiration or exercise, the risk-free interest rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility
of the stock price in the future, and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value
measurement.

purchase director and officer insurance due to being publicly traded. The Company increased its headcount and moved into a larger office

30, 2024, office and administrative expenses also include share-based compensation of 53,977, compared to 337,551 in the nine ended

ended September 30, 2024, were 36,862, compared to 9,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to the Company
engaging in more investor relation activities as it is now a publicly listed entity. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities
in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support
from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and ultimately the attainment
of profitable operations. 

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023,
the Company had a net working capital of 6,097,404 and 3,622,091, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of 11,334,888 and 7,023,890,
respectively. Furthermore, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of 4,310,998 and 3,143,601,
respectively and used 3,486,435 and 2,168,661, respectively of cash flows for operating activities. These factors raise substantial
doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our principal liquidity requirements are for working
capital, capital expenditure, research and development and inventory production. We fund our liquidity requirements primarily through
cash on hand, cash flows from operations, the issuance of common, warrants and preferred stock, and the issuance of notes. As of September
30, 2024, we had cash of 6,425,670, with 3,326,851 as of December 31, 2023. 

The following table provides selected financial
data as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash flows used in operating activities was 3,486,435 compared to 2,168,661 used during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
respectively, primarily due to net loss and timing of settlement of assets and liabilities. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023, we used 171,480 and 11,191, respectively, in investing activities. In the current period this cash flow primarily related
to the payment of 162,320 for intangible assets relating to the purchase of a license to produce stem cells and the purchase of rights
to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products. The cash flow during the current period also relates to the purchase of equipment
for our laboratory space to be used for the production of inventory and research and development. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had net cash flow provided by financing activities of 6,757,501 compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of 1,501,086
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company raised 6,993,059
and 1,463,586, respectively, through the issuance of common stock and common stock purchase warrants; 914,442 and Nil, respectively,
through the issuance of notes; and Nil and 37,500, respectively, upon the exercise of stock options in exchange for common stock. The
cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was partially offset by the repayment of notes
of 1,150,000. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates 

This discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly
evaluates estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, the collectability of receivables, valuation of inventory, fair value
of derivative liabilities and stock options, useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, and deferred income tax asset valuation
allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value
of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced
by the Company may differ materially and adversely from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the
effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined. 

The Company s policy for property and equipment
requires judgement in determining whether the present value of future expected economic benefits exceeds capitalized costs. The policy
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions about future economic benefits related to its operations. Estimates and
assumptions may change if new information becomes available. If information becomes available suggesting that the recovery of capitalized
cost is unlikely, the capitalized cost is written off/impaired to the consolidated statement of operations. 

The assessment of whether the going concern assumption
is appropriate requires management to take into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited
to, 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued. The Company is aware that material uncertainties related to events or
conditions may cast substantial doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Revenue Recognition 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Since ASU 2014-09 was issued, several additional ASUs have been issued to clarify various elements
of the guidance. These standards provide guidance on recognizing revenue, including a five-step model to determine when revenue recognition
is appropriate. 

The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies
a performance obligation by transferring control over a product to a customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration the Company
expects to receive in exchange for those products. In instances where financial acceptance of the product is specified by the customer,
revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. Revenues are recognized under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of its products and services to customers in return for expected
consideration. 

32 

The Company generates revenue through the sale
of skincare products. Revenue from the sale of skincare products are recognized at the point in time when the Company considered revenue
realized or realizable and earned, which is typically when all of the five following criteria are met: (1) the contract with the customer
is identifiable (i.e. when a sales transaction has been entered into between the Company and the customer), (2) the performance obligation
in the contract is identifiable (i.e. the customer has ordered a known quantity of product to be delivered), (3) the transaction price
is determinable (i.e. the customer has agreed to the Company s price for the products ordered), (4) the Company is able to allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied, which is
typically upon delivery of the product to the customer. 

Transaction prices for performance obligations
are explicitly outlined in relevant agreements; therefore, the Company does not believe that significant judgements are required with
respect to the determination of the transaction price, including any variable consideration identified. 

The Company is responsible for providing the products
to customers. As a result, the Company is considered the principal when providing products to customers. As the Company collects payment
at the time of the customer order, its contracts do not have a significant financing component. Customers are entitled to replacement
or full refund of any damaged or defective product, after the return of the damaged or defective product to the Company. There were no
significant returns or refunds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company s functional and reporting currency
is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company s Canadian subsidiary, Elevai Research Inc. Elevai Research is the Canadian dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing
at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets, liabilities, and items recorded in income arising from transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement
of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. 

The accounts of Elevai Research are translated
to U.S. dollars using the current rate method. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-end
exchange rate while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Related exchange gains and losses
are included in a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 

Inventory 

Inventory consists of raw materials, work-in-progress
and finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company s manufacturing process involves the
production of our proprietary stem cell-derived Elevai Exosomes TM . Finished goods consists of a new generation of cosmetic
topical products containing our proprietary stem cell-derived Elevai Exosomes TM . Cost is determined using the weighted average
cost formula. Net realizable value is determined on the basis of anticipated sales proceeds less the estimated selling expenses. Management
compares the cost of inventories with the net realizable value and an allowance is made to write down inventories to net realizable value,
if lower. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

Employees - The Company accounts for share-based
compensation under the fair value method which requires all such compensation to employees, including the grant of employee stock options,
to be calculated based on its fair value at the measurement date (generally the grant date), and recognized in the consolidated statement
of operations over the requisite service period. 

Non-employees - During June 2018, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ASU 2018-07 to simplify the accounting for share-based
payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees. Under the requirements of ASU 2018-07,
the Company accounts for share-based compensation to non-employees under the fair value method which requires all such compensation to
be calculated based on the fair value at the measurement date (generally the grant date) and recognized in the statement of operations
over the requisite service period. 

33 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023, the Company recorded 57,521 and 346,548, respectively, in share-based compensation expense, of which 53,977 and 337,550,
and 3,544 and 8,998, respectively is included in office and administration and research and development, respectively. 

Determining the appropriate fair value model and
the related assumptions requires judgment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and year ended December 31, 2023, the fair
value of each option grant was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 

The expected volatility represents the historical
volatility of comparable publicly traded companies in similar industries, adjusted for variables such as stock price, market capitalization
and life cycle. Due to limited historical data, the expected term for options granted is equal to the contractual life. The risk-free
interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options. The Company has not
paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to
be zero. 

Concentrations 

Customers 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
no single customer represented 10 or more of the Company s revenue. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company
recorded 14 of its revenue from its largest customers. The Company s largest customer, representing 139,149 of revenue, relates
to sales to a wholesaler during the period. 

Suppliers 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023, the Company had 3 key suppliers that represented approximately 78 and 3 key suppliers that represented approximately 66 , respectively,
of the cost incurred in the purchase and production of inventory. The table below represents a breakdown of each supplier as a percentage
of the cost incurred. (Suppliers are shown from largest to smallest and do not necessarily represent the same suppliers period over period): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024

 Supplier 2

The Company continually evaluates the performance
of its suppliers and the availability of alternatives to substitute or supplement its inventory production supply chain. The Company believes
that a breakdown in supply from one of its key suppliers would be overcome in a short amount of time given the availability of alternatives. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources that is material to investors. 

34 

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act (the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, eases certain reporting
requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will
be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies.
We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective
dates. 

Future Related Party Transactions 

The Corporate Governance Committee of our Board
of Directors is required to approve all related party transactions. All related party transactions are made or entered into on terms that
are no less favorable to use than can be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. 

Impact of Inflation 

We do not believe the impact of inflation on our
Company is material. 

Inflation Risk 

We are also exposed to inflation risk. Inflationary
factors, such as increases in labor costs, could impair our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on
our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse
changes in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposure is generally limited to those risks that arise in the normal course of business,
as we do not engage in speculative, non-operating transactions, nor do we utilize financial instruments or derivative instruments
for trading purposes.
