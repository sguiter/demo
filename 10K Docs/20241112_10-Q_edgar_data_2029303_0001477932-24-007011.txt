Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Tech Tonic Group Corp. was incorporated in Wyoming on July 24, 2023. We are development stage company and commences operations in the software and mobile application development industries. We offer services for both startups and large corporations, helping them create innovative and functional software and mobile solutions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. As of September 30, 2024, our total assets were 11,900 compared to 2,000 in total assets at June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our total liabilities were 7,854 compared to 5,000 in total liabilities at June 30, 2024. Stockholders equity was 4,046 as of September 30, 2024 compared to stockholders deficit of (3,000) as of June 30, 2024. Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 Revenue During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company had 10,000 in revenue. Operating Expenses During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we incurred total operating expenses of 2,954, comprised of general and administrative expenses, compared to 301 for the period from Inception (July 24, 2023) to September 30, 2023. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and developmental costs. Our net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 7,046 compared to net loss of 301 for the period from Inception (July 24, 2023) to September 30, 2023. 10 Table of Contents Cash Flows used by Operating Activities For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by operating activities were 5,633 comprised of net income of 7,046, amortization expenses of 87 and decrease in accounts payable of 1,500; compared to (301) for the period from Inception (July 24, 2023) to September 30, 2023.

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. GOING CONCERN The independent registered public accounting firm auditors' report accompanying our June 30, 2024 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management has a disclosure in the financial statements to this effect as well. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 11 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

Our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) within the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in a timely manner.
