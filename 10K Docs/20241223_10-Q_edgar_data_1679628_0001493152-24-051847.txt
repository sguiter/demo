SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of
historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business
strategy, development plans, planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, future results of clinical trials, expected research and
development costs, regulatory strategy, timing and likelihood of success, as well as plans and objectives of management for future operations,
are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, 
 should, would, expect, plan, anticipate, could, intend, 
 target, project, contemplate, believe, estimate, predict, 
 potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements
contained in this report include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

the
 ability of our preclinical studies and planned clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidate JOTROL,
 and other positive results; 

the
 timing, progress and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for JOTROL and other product candidates we may develop, including
 statements regarding the timing of initiation and completion of studies or trials and related preparatory work, the period during
 which the results of the studies or trials will become available, and our research and development programs; 

the
 timing, scope and likelihood of regulatory filings and approvals, including timing of INDs and final FDA approval of JOTROL and any
 other future product candidates; 

the
 timing, scope or likelihood of foreign regulatory filings and approvals; 

our
 ability to develop and advance our current product candidate JOTROL and programs into, and successfully complete, clinical studies; 

our
 manufacturing, commercialization, and marketing capabilities and strategy; 

our
 plans relating to commercializing our product candidates, if approved, including the geographic areas of focus and sales strategy; 

the
 need to hire additional personnel and our ability to attract and retain such personnel; 

the
 size of the market opportunity for our product candidate JOTROL, including our estimates of the number of patients who suffer from
 the diseases we are targeting; 

our
 expectations regarding the approval and use of our product candidate JOTROL in combination with other drugs; 

our
 competitive position and the success of competing therapies that are or may become available; 

our
 estimates of the number of patients that we will enroll in our clinical trials; 

the
 beneficial characteristics, and the potential safety, efficacy and therapeutic effects of our product candidate JOTROL; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our product candidate JOTROL; 

3 

our
 plans relating to the further development of our product candidate JOTROL, including additional indications we may pursue; 

existing
 regulations and regulatory developments in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions; 

our
 intellectual property position, including the scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property
 rights covering JOTROL and other product candidates we may develop, including the extensions of existing patent terms where available,
 the validity of intellectual property rights held by third parties, and our ability not to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
 violate any third-party intellectual property rights; 

our
 continued reliance on third parties to conduct additional preclinical studies and planned clinical trials of our product candidate
 JOTROL, and for the manufacture of our product candidate JOTROL for preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

our
 relationships with patient advocacy groups, key opinion leaders, regulators, the research community and payors; 

our
 ability to obtain, and negotiate favorable terms of, any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that may be necessary or
 desirable to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidate JOTROL; 

the
 pricing and reimbursement of JOTROL and other product candidates we may develop, if approved; 

the
 rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of JOTROL and other product candidates we may develop; 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

our
 financial performance; 

the
 period over which we estimate our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our future operating expenses and
 capital expenditure requirements; 

the
 impact of laws and regulations; 

our
 expectations regarding the period during which we will qualify as an emerging growth company under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups
 Act of 2012 and a smaller reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 

our
 anticipated use of our existing resources and the proceeds from our initial public offering; and 

the
 price of our common stock could be subject to rapid and substantial volatility. As a relatively small-capitalization company with
 relatively small public float, we may experience greater stock price volatility, extreme price run-ups, lower trading volume and
 less liquidity than large-capitalization companies. In addition, if the trading volumes of our common stock are low, persons buying
 or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence prices of our common stock. This low volume of trades could also cause
 the price of our common stock to fluctuate greatly, with large percentage changes in price occurring in any trading day session.
 Holders of our common stock may also not be able to readily liquidate their investment or may be forced to sell at depressed prices
 due to low volume trading. 

We
have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about our business, the industry in which
we operate and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and
these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or development. These forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date of this report and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section titled Risk
Factors and elsewhere in this report. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some
of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update
or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. 

In
addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable
basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have
conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain
and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value
Measurements, continued 

The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into six broad levels. The following is a brief description
of those three levels: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices that are
observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no
market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant
would use.

should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited interim
condensed financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical
information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our
actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 

Throughout
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to we, our, us, the Company, or

Overview 

Jupiter
Neurosciences, Inc. (the Company is a clinical stage research and development pharmaceutical company located in Jupiter,
Florida. The Company incorporated in Delaware in January 2016. The Company has developed a unique resveratrol platform product primarily
targeting treatment of neuro-inflammation. 

The
product, called JOTROL, has many potential indications of use for rare diseases, which of we primarily are targeting Mucopolysaccharidoses
Type 1, Friedreich s ataxia and MELAS. In the larger disease areas, we are primarily targeting Parkinson s Disease and Mild
Cognitive Impairment/early Alzheimer s disease. 

The
Company has recently completed preclinical activities in a validated mouse model of Parkinson s Disease (PD) at the University
of Miami. The model of PD that was used mimics many aspects of the disease utilizing a unilateral injection of a neurotoxin precursor
that elicits nigral cell loss, striatal dopamine loss and behavior deficits similar to physiological characteristics of human disease.
We believe that results from this trial indicates that PD might be the best target for treatment among the multiple indications where
JOTROL might play a role. The trial design and outcomes are further described section Description of Business . On May 23,
2024 the US Senate unanimously passed the National Plan to End Parkinson s Act , the first-ever federal legislation dedicated
to ending Parkinson s disease. A cross-country strategy to end Parkinson s and atypical parkinsonism has the potential to: 

Dramatically
 increase federal research funding; 

Develop
 more effective pathways for treatments and cures; 

Improve
 early diagnosis; 

Spark
 new and improved models for patient care; 

Create
 standards and measures to prevent Parkinson s disease; 

Address
 health disparities in diagnosis, treatment and clinical trial participation and 

Enhance
 public awareness of the disease. 

The
Company intends to follow the various opportunities closely with a particular focus on seeking available funding to accelerate research
and development JOTROL s Parkinson s Disease indication. However, there is no assurance that such funding will ever become
available or be awarded to the Company. 

5 

We
have over the past 2 years received a strong interest in JOTROL from various Asian organizations. We believe that this interest has been
triggered, in part, by (i) resveratrol becoming commonly used in Asian herbal medicines as a therapeutic strategy as described in available
scientific literature published by PubMed Central: PMCID: PMC7498443 (September 2020), (ii) Hong Kong s and China s recent
approval of the patent for JOTROL, (iii) China releasing a list of approximately 120 rare disease indications issued jointly by five
national bodies, including the National Health Commission, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology,
State Drug Administration, and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (May 2018), that we believe JOTROL can be applicable
as a treatment for MPS-1 and MELAS in this population and (iv) recent publications regarding JOTROL in the Journal of Alzheimer s
Disease and AAPS Open (Journal of Alzheimer s Disease 86 (2022) 173 190 February 2022; Kemper et al. AAPS Open June 2022).
(v) the projected increase of the TCM market due to several factors which of one is reformulation of existing compounds. Our Chairman
 CEO, Christer Ros n, presented in person, our company s status and pipeline at the BIOHK 2023 in Hong Kong in September
of 2023. The presentation led to several follow-on meetings, and we have therefore recently agreed to service agreements in the areas
of CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls), regulatory affairs and clinical trial management. These agreements are with companies
that, we believe, have the knowledge and network in the South-East Asian market to accelerate steps that is needed to have a product
that can have treatment value in the territory. In addition, we are planning to use some of the IPO proceeds to engage a partner in business
development in the South-East Asian market since we believe that this will increase the potential of an out-licensing deal within the
near future. The agreements are further described in the section Other Material Agreements . In addition, we are in active
negotiations with Dominant Treasure Health DTH ), a BVI company. DTH has demonstrated to us, through several company introductions,
that they have business relationships, either directly or through affiliates, with many South-East Asian pharmaceutical companies as
well as companies involved in distribution and sales of TCM, Traditional Chinese Medicine. We are therefore planning to engage DTH in
active business development in China, Malaysia and Singapore as soon as we have financing in place for their engagement. DTH has already
introduced us to 3 Chinese companies, Beimei Pharma, http://en.beimeiyaoye.com, that specializes in pediatric medications, Sichuan Kelun
Pharmaceutical Co., ltd, a publicly traded company that is part of the Kelun Industrial Group, https://www.kelun.com/, and Tianjin Pharmaceuticals,
https://en.pharm.com.cn/, that advocates the corporate core values of Love, Integrity and Power . TCM products are run in
a separate division within Tianjin. Discussions with all three companies are ongoing. We believe that with DTH s assistance we
can co-ordinate and oversee the work of our Service providers in the territory and more expediently negotiate and finalize an out-license
agreement with one or more pharmaceutical companies in South-East Asia. The Asian market is very large and hard to penetrate for a small
company and we believe that our strategy with these agreements have the possibility to accelerate an out-licensing deal in the South-East
Asian territories. However, there are no assurances that this approach will be successful. 

We
believe that a high dose of resveratrol is needed for therapeutic effects. Currently available resveratrol products are associated with
severe gastrointestinal (GI) side effects at the dose levels we believe are needed. Our belief is based on available scientific literature,
preclinical trial results conducted in mice and rats, and previously conducted human trials with resveratrol. We believe that JOTROL,
based on the results from our Phase I trial, see section Description of Business , has the potential to deliver a therapeutically
effective dose of resveratrol in the blood stream without causing gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Based on our pre-clinical and Phase
I study results, we expect that JOTROL will resolve the major obstacle of resveratrol s poor bioavailability as discussed
in AY Berman s summary article in the Journal of Precision Oncology (AY Berman, 2017). Based on our own preclinical studies we
believe that resveratrol has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In studies conducted in Friedreich s ataxia (FA) and
Alzheimer s disease (AD) patients, resulted in positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function.
The FA study was concluded in Australia by Murdoch Children s Research Institute in 2015 (Yiu et al.). The AD study was conducted
in 2015 by the Alzheimer s Disease Cooperative Study with Professor Raymond Turner, MD, Ph.D., Georgetown, as principal investigator
(Turner et al.). Both studies have been published in scientific journals and further described in the section Description of Business . 

In
2020, we received approval for full funding, 1.76 million, for our Phase I study from the National Institute on Aging NIA ).
Since there were unanticipated higher costs, mostly due to Covid-19 related additional procedures during the Phase I trial, a supplemental
grant of 233,281 was submitted to the NIA in December of 2021. We were awarded the supplemental grant on April 7, 2022. In the NIA scientific
review summary statement of our Phase I study application, it is stated that the NIA is looking forward to a Phase II study with an enhanced
resveratrol product, based on the earlier study results from the well published Turner et al. Alzheimer s study. In April 2021,
we submitted our first grant application to the NIA for full funding of a Phase II trial in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early
Alzheimer s disease. The Phase II trial was designed to focus on 3 areas: 1) safety and tolerability; 2) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
measuring of responses from 2 different doses vs. placebo; and 3) measuring of effect on multiple biomarkers related to the disease The
application was not accepted but we were encouraged by the NIA to refine our application and submit again. We have since submitted 3
grant applications, with budgets of 20 million or higher, to the NIA for full funding of such Phase II trial but none of those applications
were successful. The NIA scientific review of our Alzheimer s Phase II trial grant application shows a total score of 47 which
is our best score so far. A score of 40 or below is necessary for being considered for funding. After discussions with the NIA, we have
decided to apply, in September of 2024, for a much smaller grant, 2.5 million, for a Proof of Concept study focusing on JOTROL s
effect on validated biomarker. The final study design is not yet determined but a draft synopsis is described in the section Description
of Business . There is no guarantee that this and future grant applications will be successful and therefore the rejection of our
future grant application may significantly delay the Company s plans in connection with MCI and Alzheimer s and may have
a significant impact on the Company s financial performance. Further, the Company may never receive any future grants or costs
savings. The Company continues to apply for grants opportunistically and on August 12, 2022, submitted a 10.1 million grant to the Department
of Defense for a Phase II Friedreich s Ataxia study. This study planned to assess the efficacy of JOTROL as a potential treatment
for FA through a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. On December 30 the Company received notification that the application
was not recommended for funding. The grounds for denial were the weaknesses noted in the peer review summary statement specifically concerning
clinical impact and research strategy and feasibility. Reata Pharmaceuticals has recently received an approval for their product, Omaveloxolone,
for treatment of Friedreich s ataxia. After the FDA approval was achieved by Reata, Biogen announced that it has agreed to purchase
Reata for 7.3 billion in cash. The approval of Omaveloxolone will make it hard to find patients for a FA clinical study in USA and therefore
we have decided to explore the possibility of conducting a Phase II trial in Europe and/or Australia.

Since
inception, we have operated with limited human capital, utilizing agreements with academia to get pre-clinical work executed at no cost,
negotiating favorable deals for data already produced for resveratrol (e.g. toxicity studies and Phase II clinical study data), obtaining
a full grant from the NIA for our first clinical trial and building a management and scientific consulting team (consisting of the Scientific
Advisory Board and business advisors) as well as negotiating service agreements with companies to handle CMC, Regulatory work and Clinical
trials in South-East Asia primarily compensated with equity securities of the company. We believe that this compensation method aligns
the management, Scientific Advisory Board members and business advisors interests with the shareholders. We believe that our structure
with a core management team that has experience in the utilization of outside resources makes it possible for us to efficiently execute
several programs simultaneously in a cost-effective way. 

Resveratrol 

Resveratrol
has been studied for over 50 years by academic institutions as well as by small and large pharmaceutical companies. The multi-functional
mechanisms of resveratrol are well documented in over 9,000 scientific publications. Several of these publications, including a summary
paper by AY Berman.et al, published in Precision Oncology 2017, point to the issue of the poor bioavailability that has stopped medical
utilization of regular resveratrol and never received regulatory approval for any indication. We believe that the Phase I study we have
conducted indicates that we have resolved the poor bioavailability issue with JOTROL. Resveratrol (3,4 ,5- trihydroxystilbene)
is a nutraceutical that has recently attracted a lot of research attention due to its pharmacological potential. It is a phytoalexin
found in many plants including grapes, peanuts, and berries. Resveratrol was first isolated in Veratrum grandiflorum, or white hellebore
plant, in the 1940 s. Stilbene compounds are known for their ability to provide plants with resistance to microbial and fungal
infection. Early research showed that resveratrol was present in large quantities in injured, infected, and ultraviolet-treated leaves.
Processed plant products also contain a significant amount of resveratrol. 

Based
upon available scientific literature, it appears that resveratrol is an activator of SIRT1, one of the mammalian forms of the sirtuin
family of proteins. SIRT1 deacetylates histones and nonhistone proteins including transcription factors. The SIRT1-regulated pathway
affects metabolism, stress resistance, cell survival, cellular senescence, inflammation/immune function, endothelial functions, and circadian
rhythms. Resveratrol has been documented in scientific literature to activate SIRT1, NrF2, NLR3P inflammasomes and have an epigenetic
mechanism and therefore is predicted to benefit diseases affected by abnormal metabolic control, inflammation, and cell cycle defects.
Nonetheless, resveratrol application is a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry, due to its poor solubility and bioavailability,
as well as adverse effects, such as severe gastro-intestinal side effects when taken at effective dose levels (over 2,000 mg daily).
In this context, studies have proposed that structural changes in the resveratrol molecule, including glycosylation, alkylation, halogenation,
hydroxylation, methylation, and prenylation could lead to the development of derivatives with enhanced bioavailability and pharmacological
activity. Resveratrol has never been developed with all the necessary steps to achieve an approval as a pharmaceutical product since
the existing natural supplements cannot provide high enough levels of resveratrol in blood plasma to be able to provide a therapeutically
effective dose without generating severe gastro-intestinal side effects. This means that we need to take JOTROL through the full
regulatory NDA (New Drug Application) requirement to obtain a prescription marketing approval in the USA.

Resveratrol
holds a significant place in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) due to its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In TCM,
resveratrol-rich plants, such as the root of Polygonum cuspidatum (commonly known as Hu Zhang), have been used for centuries to treat
a variety of ailments. The compound is prized for its ability to combat oxidative stress and inflammation, which are underlying factors
in many chronic diseases. This aligns with the TCM principle of restoring balance and harmony within the body to maintain health and
prevent disease. Resveratrol s role in TCM extends to supporting cardiovascular health, boosting immune function, and even exhibiting
anti-aging properties, making it a versatile and valuable component of the medicinal repertoire. 

The
growing body of scientific research on resveratrol has further cemented its importance in TCM by providing a modern understanding of
its mechanisms and potential therapeutic benefits. Studies have shown that resveratrol can modulate various molecular pathways, including
those involved in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammation, which are crucial in the management of conditions such as cardiovascular
diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancers. This scientific validation supports TCM practitioners in integrating resveratrol
into their treatment protocols, enhancing the credibility and acceptance of traditional remedies. Additionally, the compound s
ability to improve metabolic health and its neuroprotective effects are particularly relevant in addressing the rising prevalence of
metabolic syndrome and cognitive decline in aging populations. As research continues to unveil the full spectrum of resveratrol s
benefits, its integration into TCM practices is likely to increase, further bridging the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary
medicine. 

The
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) market is experiencing several technological trends that are transforming how traditional remedies
are developed, delivered, and integrated with modern healthcare practices. These advancements are helping to increase the efficacy, accessibility,
and acceptance of TCM. Below are some of the key technological trends in the TCM market: 

i. 
 Digital
 platforms and telemedicine services allow patients to consult with TCM practitioners remotely, expanding access to TCM treatments.

j. 
 Apps
 are being developed to help users track their health metrics, manage their treatment plans, and access personalized TCM advice. 

k. 
 Using
 advanced extraction techniques to concentrate active ingredients from traditional herbs, resulting in more potent and consistent
 products. 

l. 
 Development
 of new delivery methods such as transdermal patches, sustained-release capsules, and nanoparticles to enhance the bioavailability
 and efficacy of TCM products.

JOTROL 

JOTROL
was developed together with our technology partner Aquanova AG, Darmstadt, Germany. JOTROL is formulated with a unique patented micellar
technology that is projected to increase the bioavailability profile of resveratrol. Manufacturing technology transfers were completed
in 2017 and manufacturing procedures and clinical trial supply manufacturing has been completed at Catalent Pharmaceutical Services,
Inc., St Petersburg, Florida. 

JOTROL
is a micellar non-aqueous solution of resveratrol delivered in a softgel capsule. Each capsule includes 100mg of resveratrol. Pre-clinical
trials in mice and rats were conducted comparing JOTROL to micronized resveratrol, labeled to have the highest bioavailability in the
nutritional market, to demonstrate that we could achieve a significantly higher bioavailability. Summary details of these studies are
included in the section Description of Business . A Phase I dose finding pharmacokinetic PK study in healthy
volunteers was completed during the first half of 2021. The study results met our targeted goals. The results from this study will be
used as a cross-reference for all indications where JOTROL will be used in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. The Phase I results
and the FDA guidance of cross-referencing is further described in the section Description of Business . The Company has
not discussed the use of cross-referencing in this manner with the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities.

Financial
Position 

For
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated no revenues from product sales and reported net losses of 4,783,689
and 4,957,580 respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of 480,953 and 1,248,504, respectively. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated no revenues from product sales and reported net losses of 911,998 and 4,354,044, respectively,
and negative cash flow from operating activities of 215,225 and 319,816, respectively. As noted in our financial statements, as of
September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 24,494,502.

and Federal Awards 

There
was no revenue from product sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 as we are focused on research and development. 

We
intend to apply for additional federal grants through the Small Business Innovation and Research programs through the National Institute
of Health NIH ). In April 2021, we submitted our first grant application to the NIA for full funding of a Phase II trial
in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer s disease. The Phase II trial was designed to focus on 3 areas: 1) safety
and tolerability; 2) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, measuring of responses from 2 different doses vs. placebo; and 3) measuring
of effect on multiple biomarkers related to the disease. The application was not accepted but we were encouraged by the NIA to refine

There is no guarantee that this and future grant applications will be successful and therefore the rejection of our future grant application
may significantly delay the Company s plans in connection with MCI and Alzheimer s and may have a significant impact on the
Company s financial performance. We intend to apply for Phase IIB for clinical trial related to Orphan diseases. Phase IIB grants
may fund 50 of clinical trial expenses over three years, not to exceed approximately 2,500,000 per year for a maximum of three years.
However, those limits may be adjusted annually at the discretion of the Small Business Administration. We recognize there is no guarantee
of future federal grant funding and that might have an impact on our possibility to conclude our planned MCI/early Alzheimer s
disease project. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development R D expenses were 91,911 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 239,458 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction of employee salaries that began in December 2023. 

R D
expenses related to the federal grant were segregated in the chart of accounts from non-federal award costs. At this time, we are not
tracking R D expenses per indication as all of the R D expenses incurred to date related to JOTROL, which is the platform product
used in each indication defined in our product pipeline. Costs will be segregated amongst the different indications beginning next fiscal
year. 

In
addition, the probability of success for JOTROL will depend on numerous factors, including manufacturing capability, satisfactory results
in follow on clinical trials, regulatory approvals and commercial viability. See Risk Factors .

Loss
on Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

As
of September 30, 2024 and 2023 the variable conversion options embedded in our convertible notes were marked to market and the change in fair
value of the derivative was recorded as a gain (loss) of 9,885 and 34,086), in the three month ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest expense was 107,382 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 80,610 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Interest
expense is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our previously outstanding notes payable, convertible notes payable
and related amortization of the debt discount, notes payable to Chief Executive Officer, Christer Ros n, and interest expense
on our corporate credit card. The increase is mainly attributed to the increase in the interest rate associated with the notes as agreed upon in
January 2024. 

Loss
on Extinguishment of Debt and (Loss) 

During
2024 and 2023, the Senior Secured Convertible Note were amended several times with materially different economics thus requiring for
the recording of debt as an extinguishment and re-recording the debt with the amended terms. This resulted in a loss on extinguishment
of debt in the three month ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 0 and 217,527, respectively.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources; Plan of Operations 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 253. Our cash equivalents are held in high yield savings account. Since inception,
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations. On September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 24,494,502. 

We
have historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock and convertible debt. On April 11, 2022, we issued
a senior secured convertible note in the principal amount of 1,111,111 in exchange for 1,000,000 as described above under Description
of Business Corporate History. 

On December 4, 2024, the Company closed on an offering in which we sold 2,750,000 shares of Common Stock to the underwriters
for total gross proceeds of 11,000,000. After deducting the underwriting commissions, discounts, and offering expenses payable by the
Company, the Company received net proceeds of approximately 9.5 million. 

Management expects
operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future. As we continue to incur losses, a transition to profitability is dependent upon
the successful development, approval and commercialization of our drug candidate and the achievement of a level of revenues adequate
to support our cost structure. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our drug candidate and fund operations for the
foreseeable future. We may seek to raise capital through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements
with other companies, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms,
or at all. 

Our
failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business
strategies. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, the requirements of which will depend on many factors,
including: 

the
 scope, rate of progress and costs of our drug delivery, preclinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials
 for our drug candidate; 

the
 number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

the
 scope and costs of manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities; 

the
 extent to which we acquire or in-license other drug candidate and technologies; 

the
 cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidate; 

the
 cost and timing of establishing sales and marketing capabilities, if of our drug candidate receives marketing approval; 

11 

the
 costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights
 and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

our
 efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support
 the development of our drug candidate; 

the
 costs associated with being a public company; and 

the
 cost associated with commercializing our drug candidate, if it receives marketing approval. 

If
we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which
we enter may impose upon us additional covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or
additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or
asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our
stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of
our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to other parties rights to develop or commercialize
our drug candidate that we would prefer to retain. 

See
 Risk Factors for additional risks associated with our capital requirements.

Net
Cash from Operating Activities: 

Cash
used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 104,591 from September 30, 2023, mainly attributable to a decrease of 158,019 in stock-based compensation, 1,356,960 in accrued compensation, and 86,384 in accounts payable and accrued expenses,
offset by a 1,798,673 in changes associated with debt (amortization of debt discounts, loss on extinguishment
of debt, and gain/loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities). 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities: 

Cash
flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 128,000 from the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 due to a reduction in investment proceeds from issuance of notes payable, related parties. 

Off-balance
sheet financing arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased
any non-financial assets. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during
the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 

Federal
Contract Revenue 

The
Company recognizes federal contract revenue from the NIH Award in the period in which the allowable research and development expenses
are incurred, and receivables associated with this revenue are included within federal contract revenue receivable on our balance sheets.
This revenue is not within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue from contracts with customers. 

13 

Research
and Development 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical
trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, monitoring
visits, clinical site activations, or information provided to us by our vendors with respect to their actual costs incurred. Payments
for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are
reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expense, as the case may be. Total research and development
costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 291,655 and 710,063, respectively. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718,
Compensation Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, which requires the recognition of expense related to the fair value of stock-based
awards in the statements of operations. For stock options issued to employees, non-employees and members of our board of directors for
their services on our board of directors, the Company estimates the grant-date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use
of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the
expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates, and, for grants prior
to our initial public offering, the value of the common stock. For awards subject to time-based vesting, the Company recognized stock-based
compensation expense, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of the award. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation expense totaled 827,356 and 985,376, respectively. 

Clinical
Trial Expenses 

As
part of the process of preparing our financial statements, the Company is required to estimate expenses resulting from obligations under
contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting
clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result
in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. The Company s
objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in the financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which
services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured
by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. The Company determines accrual estimates based on estimates of
services received and efforts expended that take into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to
the progress or state of consummation of trials. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts the clinical expense recognition
if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company makes estimates of the accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based
on the facts and circumstances known at that time. The clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of
contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although the Company does not expect the estimates to be materially different
from amounts actually incurred, understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing
of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period.

Convertible
Notes with Embedded Derivative Liabilities 

The
Company has entered into convertible notes, some of which contain variable conversion options, whereby the outstanding principal and
accrued interest may be converted, by the holder, into shares of common stock at a fixed discount to the price of the common stock at
or around the time of conversion upon certain trigger events. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if those
contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance
with ASC 815-10 Derivative and Hedging Contract in Entity s Own Equity . This accounting treatment requires
that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In
the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period
is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked
to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or
expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The
Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon such
evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended
September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. 

On
July 19, 2022, Tiberend Strategic Advisors Tiberend ), an entity that the Company had previously engaged as a communications
and investor relations firm, filed a summons for civil action in the District Court of Southern Florida against the Company alleging
non-payment by the Company under a services agreement (the Services Agreement with Tiberend in the amount of 130,400.
Additionally, Tiberend was seeking an 19,600 in legal fees. Tiberend and the Company elected to take this to arbitration and at that
time both parties agreed that Tiberend will be issued a convertible note of 150,000 that will be converted into shares of the Company,
immediately after an IPO is completed, based on the share value in an IPO. 

Other
than the foregoing, we are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would
individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.
Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of
defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
