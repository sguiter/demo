On February 1, 2024, the Sponsor Handover was consummated (the Closing ). Suntone Investment Pty Ltd Suntone ), a designee and affiliate of Sriram, acquired the securities in the Transfer and has subsequently served as the Sponsor of the Company. In connection with the Closing, the parties agreed to the changes to the Company s management team and board of directors. The Trust Account Following the closing of the IPO on December 13, 2021, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account ). The funds in the Trust Account were invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). The Company is not permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the Trust Account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any. The funds held in the Trust Account will not otherwise be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of: (i) the Company s completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below. Business Combination The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO, although substantially all of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination with (or acquisition of) a Target Business. As used herein, Target Business means one or more operating businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing of a definitive agreement in connection with a Business Combination. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of a Business Combination, including any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. The per-share amount to be distributed to the public shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 5). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. As a result, Class A ordinary shares are recorded at their redemption amount and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ).

 either prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rules and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 3), and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company provides that only Public Shares and not any Founder Shares are entitled to redemption rights. In addition, the Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. The Company originally had until months from the closing of the IPO to complete a Business Combination (or up to from the closing of the IPO if the Company extended the time to complete a Business Combination by the sponsor depositing into the Trust Account for each three-month extension per share)), up to an aggregate of , or per unit, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. On March 14, 2023, the Prior Sponsor deposited an aggregate of (representing per public share) into the Trust Account for its public shareholders. The deposit enabled the Company to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a Business Combination from March 13, 2023 to June 13, 2023 (the Initial Extension ). The Initial Extension was the first of two three-month automatic extensions permitted under the Company s governing documents and provides the Company with additional time to complete a Business Combination. On June 2, 2023, the Company s shareholders voted to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination from June 13, 2023 to December 13, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by the Company s board of directors (the Board in its sole discretion) (the Second Extension ). On June 2, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Meeting ). At the Meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved, among other things, a proposal by special resolution to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination from June 13, 2023 to December 13, 2023. An aggregate of (representing per public share) was deposited into the Trust Account for each of the six one-month extension through December 13, 2023. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company exercised six one-month extensions, depositing an aggregate into the Trust Account to extend the date by which the Company had to consummate an initial business combination through December 13, 2023. In connection with the Meeting, holders of of the Company s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders.

 (representing per public share) will be deposited into the Trust Account for each of the twelve one-month extension through December 13, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, an aggregate of was deposited into the Trust Account to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination through October 13, 2024. On October 18, 2024, was deposited into the Trust Account to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination through November 13, 2024 (see Note 6). The Company has one remaining one-month extension to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination through December 13, 2024. In connection with the December Meeting, holders of of the Company s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the Termination Date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses, which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination by the Termination Date. The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination by the Termination Date. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the IPO, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination by the Termination Date. The underwriter has agreed to waive it right to its deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Termination Date and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the per share amount in the Trust Account, which was initially per public share. The Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered (other than its independent registered public accounting firm) or products sold to the Company, or a prospective Target Business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) per Public Share or (2) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay franchise and income taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and will not apply as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective Target Businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the Original Business Combination Agreement with IWAC Georgia Merger Sub, Inc., a Georgia corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Btab Ecommerce Group, Inc., a Georgia corporation Btab ).

 and in cash, respectively, and a working capital deficit of and , respectively. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. The Company may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Risks and Uncertainties Results of operations and the Company s ability to complete the Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond its control. The business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, inflation, increases in interest rates, adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine and in the Middle East. The Company cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete the Business Combination. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Quarterly Report as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry, we currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses in the health, nutrition, fitness, wellness and beauty sectors and the products, devices, applications and technology driving growth within these verticals. The issuance of additional shares in connection with a business combination to the owners of the target or other investors: may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering, which dilution would further increase if the anti- dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares; may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; could cause a change in control if a substantial number of our Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.

 Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in: default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding; our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares; using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 
 We expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The SEC has adopted new rules and regulations relating to SPACs, which became effective on July 1, 2024 (the 2024 SPAC Rules ). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC sponsors and related persons; (ii) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions (iii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iv) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions and (v) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto.

Our only activities since inception have been related to the Company s formation, the initial public offering, and identifying a target for a Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest and earnings on cash marketable securities held in the Trust Account. Our expenses have increased substantially after the closing of our initial public offering as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 24,472. Net loss is comprised primarily of formation and operating costs of 13,746, accounting and legal expenses of 443,204, listing fees of 21,250, insurance expense of 50,000, and administrative expenses due to related party of 30,000, offset by interest earned on cash held in the Trust Account of 533,728.

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern On December 13, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering of 11,500,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, which included the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,500,000 units, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,850,000 warrants to our Prior Sponsor at a purchase price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 6,850,000. A total of 117,300,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee (the Trust Account ). Transaction costs of the initial public offering amounted to 6,822,078, consisting of 2,300,000 of underwriting discount, 4,025,000 of deferred underwriting discount, and 497,078 of actual offering costs.

 We may need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination. We expect to incur significant costs to complete an initial business combination. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year from the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, its affiliates or an affiliate of our management team as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities, other than described below. We have an agreement to pay our sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination and our liquidation. Both sponsors have waived these payments under this agreement, which the Company accounts for as capital contributions from the both sponsors. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded 30,000 and 0 to Administrative Expense Related Party on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded 330,000 and 0 to Administrative Expense Related Party on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, respectively. The underwriters of the initial public offering are entitled to a deferred fee 4,025,000. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete our initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Promissory Note Related Party In March 2023, the Prior Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Extension Note in connection with the extension payment made by the Prior Sponsor to extend the Termination Date from March 13, 2023 to June 13, 2023. The Extension Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the date the business combination is consummated or the liquidation of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowed 1,150,000, the maximum amount under the Extension Note. In June 2023, the Prior Sponsor issued an additional unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Second Extension Note in connection with the shareholder approval to extend the date which the Company must consummate an initial business combination from June 13, 2023 for up to an additional six months to December 13, 2023. The Second Extension Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the date the business combination is consummated or the liquidation of the Company. The Second Extension Note has a principal amount up to 960,000, and the Prior Sponsor previously deposited 640,000 pursuant to such note to extend the time by which the Company has to complete an initial Business Combination from June 13, 2023 to October 13, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had borrowed 1,150,000 under the Extension Note and 640,000 under the Second Extension Note for aggregate borrowings of 1,790,000. These amounts are recorded to Promissory note related party on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Promissory Note - Suntone In connection with the shareholder approval to extend the date which the Company must consummate an initial business combination from June 13, 2023 to December 13, 2023, Sriram assumed the monthly extension deposits subsequent to the Prior Sponsor depositing 640,000 to extend the time by which the Company has to complete an initial business Combination from June 13, 2023 to October 13, 2023. A designee and affiliate of Sriram paid for the final two extension deposits to extend the time by which the Company has to complete an initial Business Combination from October 13, 2023 to December 13, 2023, contributing 320,000 to the Trust Account. The contributions by a designee and affiliate of Sriram were not pursuant to the Second Extension Note and instead are recorded to Promissory note - Suntone as of September 30, 2024 and Due to Suntone as of December 31, 2023 on the consolidated balance sheets. In December 2023, the Company issued a promissory note (the Third Extension Note in the aggregate principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to Sriram, pursuant to which Sriram agreed to loan the Company up to 1,500,000 in connection with the extension of the Company s Termination Date from December 13, 2023 to December 13, 2024. The Third Extension Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination, and (b) the date of the liquidation of the Company. On June 18, 2024, Sriram entered into an assignment of the Third Extension Note (the Assignment by and between Sriram, as assignor, and Suntone, as assignee. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has borrowed 2,489,623 under the Third Extension Note. This amount includes 1,533,284 of amounts previously classified to Due to Suntone on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and 956,339 of additional deposits and payments made by Suntone on behalf of the Company subsequent to the Assignment. These amounts are recorded to Promissory note Suntone on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Registration Rights Agreement The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective date of the IPO, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders will have the right to require the Company to register for resale these securities pursuant to a shelf registration under Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The holders of a majority of these securities will also be entitled to make up to three demands, plus short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders will be entitled to certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of the initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates as of September 30, 2024. Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine and in the Middle East. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete initial business combination.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as of December 31, 2022 we identified a material weakness related to the fact that we have not yet designed and maintained effective controls relating to the financial statement close process which resulted in errors in the classification of investing activities in our statements of cash flows. Specifically, we incorrectly presented dividends earned and reinvested in money market mutual funds on the trust account within the cash flows from operating activities section on our statements of cash flows. This material weakness continues to exist as of September 30, 2024. As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as of December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness related to the fact that we have not yet designed and maintained effective controls related to the accounting for complex transactions which resulted in an error in the classification of payments made under certain purchase agreements. Specifically, we incorrectly accounted for a purchase agreement whereby payments made on behalf of the Company by parties to the agreement were presented as capital contributions prior to the consummation of the purchase agreement and should have been presented as a liability. This material weakness continues to exist as of September 30, 2024. We have implemented a remediation plan which includes our Chief Financial Officer performing additional post-closing review procedures including a review of the classification of earnings on the trust account and confirmation of amounts and balances with the trustee of the trust account. We have implemented a remediation plan which includes our Chief Financial Officer consulting with legal and account experts to review complex transactions, specifically newly executed agreements, and performing additional post-closing review procedures including review of the accounting for complex transactions and newly executed agreements. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than the above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
