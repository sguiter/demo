and on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Maturities may differ from contractual maturities in mortgage-backed securities because the mortgages underlying the securities may be called or repaid without any penalties, therefore, these securities have been included in the below table based on average remaining life.

As of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , no securities were pledged to secure public deposits or for other purposes as required or permitted by law. 
 
 Information pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, is as follows: 

U.S. government agency obligations

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , certain investment securities were in unrealized loss positions. There were no securities with identified credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Unrealized losses have not been recognized into income because, based on management's evaluation, the decline in fair value is largely due to increased market rates, temporary market conditions and trading spreads, and, as such, are considered to be temporary by the Bank. In addition, management has the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or they recover their carrying values. 
 
 All U.S. Treasuries, U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage-based residential obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations are agency-issued or government-sponsored enterprise issued. Agency-issued securities are generally guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Small Business Administration, have either a direct or implied guarantee by the U.S. government. 
 
 The Bank holds two classifications of municipal bonds, general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. General obligation bonds are backed by the general revenue of the issuing municipality, while revenue bonds are supported by a specific revenue source. All general obligation and revenue bonds have a bond rating of investment grade by Standard and Poor's or Moody's Investor Services or are not rated. There have been no declines in investment grades on bonds in a loss position and as of September 30, 2024 , all municipal bonds are paying as agreed. 
 
 There were no sales of securities available-for-sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

First mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying balance sheets. The unpaid principal balance of these loans totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with the loans serviced were and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The accrued interest receivable for loans, net, was and for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively 
 
 In the normal course of business, loans are made by the Bank to directors and officers of the Company and the Bank (related parties). The terms of these loans, including interest rate and collateral, are similar to those prevailing for comparable transactions with other customers and do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , such borrowers were indebted to the Bank in the aggregate amount of and , respectively. 

The following tables present the activity in the allowance for credit losses ("ACL") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 :

The provision for credit losses excludes and related to off-balance sheet exposures, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024 , there were collateral dependent loans. As of December 31, 2023, collateral dependent loans totaled in the one to four -family residential loan segment. These loans are collateralized by residential real estate and have ACL as of December 31, 2023. There were no other collateral dependent loans as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank evaluates collectability based on payment activity and other factors. The Bank uses a graded loan rating system as a means of identifying potential problem loans, as follows: 
 
 Pass 
 Loans in these categories are performing as expected with low to average risk. 
 
 Special Mention 
 Loans in this category are internally designated by management as watch loans. These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are closely monitored by management. 
 
 Substandard 
 Loans in this category are internally designated by management as substandard. Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity of the obligors or the current net worth of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans present a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain losses if such weaknesses are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful 
 Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those designated as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses may make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Bank formally reviews the ratings on commercial loans. In addition, the Bank performs an independent review of a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio. Management uses the results of the independent review as part of its annual review process. 

The following tables present the credit risk profile of the Company's loan portfolio based on risk rating category and year of origination as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

The Bank may modify loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing modifications to repayment terms; more specifically, modifications to loan interest rates. Management performs an analysis at the time of loan modification. Any reserve required is recorded through a provision to the allowance for credit losses on loans. There were modifications on loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Bank may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. There were no assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Commitments to originate loans 
 Total commitments 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 
 The Bank generally originates single-family residential loans within its primary lending area which is Waukegan, Illinois and the surrounding area. The Bank s underwriting policies require such loans to be made at approximately loan-to-value, based upon appraised values, unless private mortgage insurance is obtained, or the loan is guaranteed by the government. These loans are secured by the underlying properties. 
 
 The Bank maintains its cash in deposit accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank or other institutions, the balances of which may exceed federally insured limits. The Bank has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Bank believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Bank assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, fair values of its financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change, and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Bank. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the overall interest rate risk. 
 
 Litigation 
 
 Due to the nature of its business activities, the Bank is at times subject to legal action which arises in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Bank. 

securities or other contracts that had a dilutive effect for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and therefore the weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted EPS are the same. Shares held by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") that have not been allocated to employees in accordance with the terms of the ESOP, referred to as "unallocated ESOP shares", are not deemed outstanding for EPS calculations.

shares of stock at per share. The Bank makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP, as well as paying dividends on unallocated shares to the ESOP, and the ESOP uses funds it receives to repay the loan. When loan payments are made, ESOP shares are allocated to participants based on relative compensation. Participants receive the shares at the end of employment. Dividends on allocated shares increase participants accounts. 
 
 There were contributions to the ESOP during the first nine months of 2024, as the annual loan payment will be made during the fourth quarter. Expense recorded was and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is recognized over the service period. 
 
 Shares held by the ESOP were as follows:

Fair value of unearned shares is based on a stock price of and as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Equity Incentive Plan 
 
 At the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on May 24, 2023, stockholders approved the NSTS Bancorp, Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan 2023 Equity Plan ), which provides for the granting of up to shares shares of restricted stock and shares available for future grants of stock options) of the Company s common stock pursuant to equity awards made under the 2023 Equity Plan. 
 
 Stock options granted under the 2023 Equity Plan generally vest in equal annual installments over a service period of five years beginning on the date of grant. The vesting of the options accelerates upon death, disability or an involuntary termination at or following a change in control of the Company. Stock options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the grant date based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, and have an expiration period of ten years. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has shares available for future grants of stock options under the 2023 Equity Plan. 
 The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Upon exercise of vested options, management expects to first draw on treasury stock as the source for shares. 

The following is a summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the periods presented.

General 
 
 On January 18, 2022, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. the Company became the holding company for North Shore Trust and Savings the Bank when North Shore MHC completed its conversion into the stock holding company form of organization. Shares of the Company's common stock began trading on January 19, 2022 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol NSTS. 
 
 NSTS Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is a Delaware corporation which was incorporated in September 2021. As a savings and loan holding company, NSTS Bancorp, Inc. is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve Board ). The Company s primary business activities relate to owning all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank. 
 
 The unaudited financial statements and other financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with NSTS Bancorp, Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings 
 
 North Shore Trust and Savings, a federally-chartered stock savings institution, was established in 1921 as North Shore Building and Loan, an Illinois-chartered institution. The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTS Bancorp, Inc., and operates as a traditional savings institution focused primarily on serving the banking needs of customers in our market area of Lake County, Illinois and adjacent communities. We operate from our headquarters and main banking office in Waukegan, Illinois, as well as two additional full-service branch offices located in Waukegan and Lindenhurst, Illinois, respectively. During the third quarter of 2023, we added additional loan production offices in Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois to complement the existing loan production office in Chicago, Illinois. Our primary business activity is attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and purchase investments. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC ). 
 
 Our Business and Franchise 
 
 For over 100 years, we have served Lake County, Illinois and the surrounding communities. We have established deep ties to the community and developed customer relationships which have spanned generations. We pride ourselves in matching our products and services to the needs of the community. 
 
 Our principal business consists of originating loans for one- to four-family residential properties, multi-family and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, and to a lesser extent home equity loans and lines of credit, construction loans, and other consumer loans in the market areas surrounding our branch footprint. We also established a loan production office in Chicago, Illinois in 2016 to originate loans outside of our branch network in a more densely populated metropolitan area, which we believe benefits us geographically. To complement the existing offices, during the third quarter of 2023, we established two additional loan production offices in Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois to expand our loan originations within the Chicagoland area. The lending teams operating in the Aurora and Plainfield, Illinois loan production offices originate as Oak Leaf Community Mortgage, a division of North Shore Trust and Savings. We attract retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding our main office and branches, offering a wide variety of deposit products. We also invest in investment securities. Our revenues are derived primarily from interest on loans, noninterest income from the sale of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and interest on investments. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, and principal and interest payments on loans and securities. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated unaudited interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 Of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain items as critical accounting policies based on the associated estimates, assumptions, judgments and complexity. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Overview 
 
 This discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding our consolidated company and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader. The purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements. As such, this discussion should be read carefully and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Our results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Results of operations are also affected by our provisions for credit losses, fee income and other noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest expense principally consists of compensation, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, advertising and business promotion and other expenses. We expect that our noninterest expenses will increase as we grow and expand our operations. Our results of operations and financial condition are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, changes in accounting guidance, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 
 
 Average Balances, Net Interest Income, and Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. All average balances are based on daily balances. The table also reflects the yields on the Company s interest-earning assets and costs of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods shown.

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE Three and Nine MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 171,000, compared to a net loss of 232,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 743,000, compared to a net loss of 188,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss for the three-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest income, specifically related to the gain on sale of mortgages. The increase in net loss, for the nine-month period is primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest expenses related to the continued investment in people and processes with the expansion of the mortgage lending team, Oak Leaf Community Mortgage. This increase is partially offset by an increase in noninterest income specifically related to the gain on loans held for sale and an increase in net interest income driven by increased interest income on loans and interest income on funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 314,000, to 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest rate spread increased to 2.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.24 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin increased to 2.96 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.59 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These increases are driven by an increase in yields earned on loans and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. 
 
 Average interest-earning assets of 247.1 million in the third quarter 2024 increased 12.8 million compared to 234.3 million for the third quarter 2023. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase in loans and interest-bearing deposits at other banks, funded by an increase in average deposit balances during the period. The average outstanding balance of loans, net, increased to 135.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 29.1 million from 106.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the average yield earned on those loans outstanding increased 125 basis points to 5.31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is a result of an overall increase in market rates on mortgage loans originated during 2024, as well as increased loan demand for specialty portfolio products which are originated at higher interest rates and with additional origination fees. 
 
 The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 89 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in our funding costs was primarily due to an increase in rates offered on time deposit accounts to remain competitive with the local market. 
 
 Net interest income increased 591,000, to 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our interest rate spread decreased to 2.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.42 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin increased to 2.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest rate spread is driven by an increased average balance of higher earning interest-bearing liabilities, specifically interest-bearing deposits, as a percentage of total assets. The increase in the interest margin is driven by an increase in yields earned on loans and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. 
 
 Average interest-earning assets of 244.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.8 million compared to 235.9 million for the same period ending September 30, 2023. The increase in average earning assets was driven by an increase in loans and interest-bearing deposits at other banks, funded by an increase in average deposit balances during the period and reduction in investment securities. The average outstanding balance of loans, net increased to 131.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 26.7 million from 105.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the average yield earned on those loans outstanding increased 109 basis points to 5.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase is a result of an overall increase in market rates on mortgage loans originated during 2024, as well as an increased loan demand for specialty portfolio products which are originated at higher interest rates and with additional origination fees. 
 
 The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 99 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase in our funding costs was primarily due to an increase in rates offered on time deposit accounts to remain competitive with the local market. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a provision for credit losses was recorded based on the current allowance for credit loss ("ACL") assessment. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 20,000, comprised of 4,000 in provision for credit losses to loans and 16,000 in provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments, including loans committed for origination. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 50,000, comprised of 51,000 in provision for credit losses on loans and a 1,000 reversal of provision of credit losses related to unfunded commitments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 142,000, comprised of 95,000 provision for credit losses on loans and 47,000 provision for credit losses related to unfunded commitments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 52,000, comprised of 53,000 provision for credit losses on loans and a 1,000 reversal of provision of credit losses related to unfunded commitments. 
 
 We will continue to assess and evaluate the estimated future credit loss impact of current market conditions in subsequent reporting periods, which will be highly dependent on credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, as well as the composition of our loan and available-for-sale securities portfolios.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income increased 273,000 to 423,000 from 150,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, noninterest income increased 792,000 from 444,000 to 1.2 million. In each case, the increases were driven by an increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans and an increase in other noninterest income. Other noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased as a result of insurance recovery funds received, totaling 70,000, due to damage from an accident that occurred at one of the branches. Management anticipates the costs associated with the capital improvements will exceed that of the funds received as additional necessary upgrades will be made concurrently. 
 
 Gain on sale of mortgages increased 268,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Gain on sale of mortgage loans increased 682,000, from 13,000 to 695,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in gain on sale of mortgages were primarily the result of an overall increase in total mortgage loans originated during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 125 loans totaling 33.3 million for a gain on sale of 695,000. Included in the number and amount of loans sold during the period were loans sold that were originated as held for investment, but subsequently sold to local community banks, totaling 2.5 million, for a total gain on sale of 79,000. Management continues to look for opportunities and markets to sell loans as we continue to see increased loan production compared to prior years.

Noninterest expenses increased 451,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expenses increased 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023. For both the three- and nine-month periods, the increase in noninterest expenses was primarily driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits. The average number of employees increased to 49 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in headcount is based on the addition of the Oak Leaf Community Mortgage team brought on during the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as additional hires during 2024 to supplement the lending team as operations continue to expand. Additionally, the Company implemented the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan on June 15, 2023, and began recognizing expenses associated with this plan in June 2023, as such expenses were higher for the periods ended 2024 compared to 2023. Marketing and advertising costs increased during 2024 as a result of an increased focus on lending operations and related marketing to our new lending area, Will County, Illinois. Data processing expenses increased as we have continued to invest in systems and processes to improve the lending experience for our customers as well as implement efficiencies within our internal processes. Additionally, certain data processing expenses are based on per employee costs, which increased due to an increase in headcount. Loan expenses increased as a result of an increase in loan originations during the periods. Equipment and occupancy costs increased as a result of two additional loan production office rental agreements in place during 2024 that were not in place during the first nine months of 2023. Management intends to continue to invest in the people and processes in place to achieve efficiencies as loan production continues to grow. 
 
 Provision for Income Tax Expense (Benefit). There was no provision for income tax expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management estimates a taxable net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to non-taxable income, such as income on tax exempt municipal securities and BOLI. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, management assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing net operating losses. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated is the cumulative taxable loss incurred over the three-year period ended September 30, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, management maintained the full valuation allowance against the federal net operating losses and net deferred tax assets to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted.

Total Assets . Total assets increased 11.7 million to 268.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 256.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by an increase in loans, net, funded by an increase in time deposits and a reduction in securities available for sale due to maturities and principal payments of securities. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 3.2 million to 34.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from 31.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in cash was driven by an increase in time deposits during the same period and principal payments received on securities available for sale. Currently, the Bank holds a majority of the cash on hand at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, earning 4.90 , to keep the funds available for increasing loan demand. Management continues to actively monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis and maintain levels of liquid assets deemed adequate. 
 
 Time deposits with other financial institutions. Time deposits with other financial institutions decreased 500,000 to 1.5 million as of September 30, 2024, from 2.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in time deposits with other financial institutions was driven by maturities during the year to date. Management has been reinvesting the matured funds into lending activities, increasing the average yield on assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 4.16 compared to 3.19 for the same period ending September 30, 2023. 
 
 Securities Available for Sale . Securities available-for-sale decreased to 75.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 82.1 million at December 31, 2023. There were no purchases or sales of securities available-for-sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank received principal payments of 4.2 million, had maturities of 4.3 million, had net premium amortization and discount accretion of 393,000 and had a decrease in the unrealized loss on the portfolio of 2.0 million. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the securities available for sale portfolio included an unrealized loss position of 9.6 million, or 11.3 of the total book value of the portfolio. Management monitors the portfolio for credit losses and believes that the decline in value does not presently represent realized losses and is due to market volatility and increased market interest rates. While the Bank does not currently intend to sell securities in a loss position, management may consider the opportunity to reposition the investment securities portfolio in the future. 
 
 Loans held for sale. Our loans held for sale increased 2.7 million to 3.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 380,000 at December 31, 2023. With the addition of Oak Leaf Community Mortgage during the late third and early fourth quarters of 2023, and the related increase in loan originations, management has increased the proportion of loan originations held for sale to the secondary market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank originated 33.6 million in loans held for sale. 
 
 Loans, net . Our loans, net, increased by 13.2 million to 133.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 120.6 million at December 31, 2023. The Bank originated 38.6 million in loans to be held in the portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had loan principal payments and payoffs of 22.8 million. The Bank continues to focus lending efforts on one- to four-family residential properties, which has seen the largest increase in balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the balance of construction loans has decreased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, however, the current available balance on construction loans is 3.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and is expected to be drawn upon within the next 12 months. In an effort to continue to grow loan originations, the Bank hired three additional mortgage loan originators during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Bank sold 2.5 million in loans that were originally held in the portfolio to local community banks. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses ACL which includes the allowance for credit losses on loans, and the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures (recorded in Other Liabilities), totaled 1.3 million, an increase of 95,000 compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL is driven by an increase in the portfolio loan balances. As of September 30, 2024, there were no loans individually assessed and no loans were rated substandard or watch. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank has no non-accrual loans and two loan past due greater than 30 days. The Bank actively monitors the loan portfolio for signs of weakening credit quality, noting as of September 30, 2024 the portfolio remains of high quality with limited credit concerns. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of unfunded commitments increased as a result of an increase in the HELOCs and construction loans originated during the first nine months of 2024 and not yet drawn upon as well as in loans committed for origination.

Table of Contents 

Deposits . Total deposits increased 11.1 million to 179.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 168.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits is primarily within the time deposit accounts as the Bank continued to offer a competitive CD special during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on current offering rates in our market area and our current deposit pricing strategy, as well as our strong historical deposit retention, management anticipates that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. Management continues to actively monitor the deposit balances and interest rates offered to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. 
 
 Additionally, management notes the percentage of time deposit accounts greater than 250,000 as a percentage of total time deposits has increased to 20.4 as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The total balance of deposit accounts greater than 250,000 as of September 30, 2024 is 40.0 million, or 22.2 of total deposits. This represents an increase from December 31, 2023 of 34.3 million, or 20.3 of total deposits. Management works closely with depositors to reduce the uninsured balances through beneficiaries as well as to ensure depositors understand the risks. 
 
 Total Equity . Total equity increased 891,000 to 78.4 million at September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to a decrease in the unrealized loss position on the securities available-for-sale portfolio. The decrease in the unrealized loss position of 1.4 million, net of the related tax effect, is due to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, the Bank began repurchasing treasury stock during the second quarter 2024, resulting in an additional 411,000 of treasury stock as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Bank maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity, as appropriate, to meet asset and liability management objectives. 
 
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB of Chicago and a 10.0 million unsecured Fed Funds line of credit with BMO Harris Bank. At September 30, 2024, we had one outstanding advance from the FHLB of Chicago totaling 5.0 million and had the capacity to borrow approximately 78.1 million additional from the FHLB of Chicago. Additionally, we had no outstanding balance under our 10.0 million federal funds line of credit with BMO Harris Bank. 
 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. 
 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 74,000 and 363,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities, which consists primarily of net change in loans receivable and net change in investment securities, was (7.0) million and 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the increase in cash used in 2024 driven by the increase in the portfolio loans. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in deposit accounts was 10.2 million and (10.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2024, totaled 54.0 million. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB of Chicago advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank elected to begin using the CBLR. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds 9 , subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. North Shore Trust and Savings Tier 1 capital to Average Assets was 23.96 and 24.72 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . At September 30, 2024, we had 2.5 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans. Our total letters and lines of credit and unused lines of credit totaled 8.2 million at September 30, 2024.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 
 
 Changes in Accounting Principles 
 
 In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Applications of Profits Interests and Similar Awards (ASU 2024-01). ASU 2024-01 adds an example to Topic 718 which illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether profits interests and similar awards should be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements under Topic 718 or under other U.S. GAAP. ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-01 is not expected to have an impact on the Company s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.
