Money market funds and U.S.
Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, because they are valued using quoted prices in active markets.
Corporate and agency bonds classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction
between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. Prices of these securities are obtained through independent,
third-party pricing services and include market quotations that may include both observable and unobservable inputs. In determining the
value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations
from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. There
were no transfers of financial instruments among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 during the period presented. 

Cash and cash equivalents,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 are carried at amounts that approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.

of the Company or a business combination resulting in any person acquiring more than of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of
the Company. 

The
Company concluded that the Pre-Funded Warrants and Common Warrants met the requirements to be classified in stockholders equity.

The
fair market value of the Pre-Funded Warrants was estimated as the difference between the share price of our stock on the agreement date
and the exercise price of the Pre-Funded Warrant. 

The
fair market value of the Common Warrants at their issuance was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The assumed dividend
yield was based upon the Company s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Expected volatility for the Company s
common stock was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company over the full term of the warrant. The risk-free interest
rate was based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve commensurate with the expected term at the time of grant. The expected term of the Common
Warrants was calculated utilizing the three-year expiration date, taking into consideration the possibility of an accelerated expiration
date pursuant to the terms of the Common Warrants. 

The
estimated fair market values of the Shares, Pre-Funded Warrants and Common Warrants have been recorded in additional paid in capital.
As of September 30, 2024, no warrants have expired or been exercised.

Report on Form 10-Q, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. 

Overview 

We are a New York City based
clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to advancing transformative therapies for the treatment of cancer and rare diseases.
We were founded on the principle of applying modern scientific, regulatory or manufacturing advancements to established mechanisms in
order to create new development opportunities. We prioritize creativity, diverse perspectives, integrity and tenacity to expedite our
goal of bringing life-changing therapies to people with limited treatment options. 

Our portfolio includes two
development programs utilizing TARA-002, an investigational cell therapy based on the broad immunopotentiator, OK-432, which was originally
granted marketing approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare as an immunopotentiating cancer therapeutic agent. This cell
therapy is currently approved in Japan for lymphatic malformations, or LMs, and multiple oncologic indications. We have secured worldwide
rights to the asset excluding Japan and Taiwan and are exploring its use in oncology and rare disease indications. TARA-002 was developed
from the same master cell bank of genetically distinct group A Streptococcus pyogenes as OK-432 (marketed as Picibanil in Japan by
Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Chugai Pharmaceutical). We are currently developing TARA-002 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer,
or NMIBC, and in LMs. 

Our lead oncology program
is TARA-002 in NMIBC, which is cancer found in the tissue that lines the inner surface of the bladder that has not spread into the bladder
muscle. Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, with NMIBC representing approximately 80 of bladder cancer
diagnoses. Approximately 65,000 patients are diagnosed with NMIBC in the United States each year. Very few new therapeutics have been
approved for NMIBC since the 1990s and the current standard of care for NMIBC includes intravesical Bacillus Calmette Gu rin,
or BCG, which has been in shortage for several decades creating a need for new therapies. The mechanism of action of TARA-002 is similar
in some ways to that of BCG. Mechanistically, TARA-002 and BCG are similar in that in that they are both intravesically administered broad-spectrum
immune potentiators that drive a TH-1 pro-inflammatory response and have a preference to M1 polarization. We found several important differences
when we compared the two drugs in pre-clinical studies that we believe make TARA-002 a potentially compelling new therapy. We found that
TARA-002 is a NOD2/TLR 2 agonist (NOD2 is defined as Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2; TLR 2 is defined as toll-like receptor
2) and BCG is a toll-like receptor 4, or TLR4, agonist. When we compared TARA-002 directly to BCG, in a cytotxcitiy assay, we found that
TARA-002 resulted in significantly stronger tumor cell killing compared to BCG. We also found that TARA-002 resulted in significantly
higher upregulation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNF- , and interferon
gamma, or interferon- . It s worth noting that TARA-002 meaningfully down-regulates Interleukin-8, or IL-8, which at prolonged
elevations is thought to increase risk for tumor recurrence in bladder cancer after BCG therapy. 

We conducted a Phase 1
open-label clinical trial to evaluate TARA-002 in treatment-na ve and treatment experienced NMIBC patients with carcinoma in
situ, or CIS, and high-grade papillary tumors, or Ta, known as the ADVANCED-1 trial. In the initial dose escalation phase of the
trial, patients received six weekly intravesical doses of TARA-002, evaluating the 10KE, 20KE and 40KE doses (Klinische Einheit, or
KE, is a German term indicating a specified weight of dried cells in vial). The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the
safety, tolerability and preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity of TARA-002, with the goal of establishing a recommended Phase 2
dose. 

Data from the ADVANCED-1
trial suggested that intravesical TARA-002 was generally well tolerated at the three dose levels evaluated in the initial phase of the
trial (10KE, 20KE, and 40KE), and no dose limiting toxicities were observed. A maximum tolerated dose was not determined, and the Company
selected the 40KE dose for use in subsequent clinical trials. The majority of reported adverse events were Grades 1 and 2 across all dose
levels, and treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, as assessed by study investigators, were in line with typical responses to bacterial
immunopotentiation and included fatigue, headache, fever and chills. The most common urinary symptoms were urinary urgency, urinary frequency,
urinary tract pain/burning, incomplete emptying and bladder spasm. Most bladder irritations resolved soon after administration, or in
a few hours to a few days. A total of nine patients were enrolled in the dose escalation portion of the study through the 40KE dose. Of
those, three patients with CIS, one of whom was a heavily pre-treated BCG-Unresponsive patient, achieved a complete response, or CR, at
the 20KE dose, and tumor regression was observed in the other two patients. Results from six patients with high-grade, non-invasive papillary,
or HGTa, tumors showed five of six patients with high-grade recurrence free survival, or HGRFS, at week 12. The patient who did not achieve
HGRFS was dosed at 10KE, the lowest dose of TARA-002 offered in the trial. An exploratory cohort of dose escalation at the 80KE was also
completed demonstrating similar safety to the 40KE dose. The 80KE dose could potentially be used as we continue to explore priming doses
with TARA-002. 

17 

Additionally, we completed
an open-label expansion clinical trial, or ADVANCED-1EXP, evaluating intravesical TARA-002 at the 40KE dose in CIS patients, including
BCG-Na ve, BCG-Unresponsive, and BCG-Experienced patients and are conducting an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial, or ADVANCED-2,
assessing intravesical TARA-002 in NMIBC patients with CIS Ta/T1) who are BCG-Na ve (n=27) and BCG-Unresponsive (n 100). 

In April 2024, we announced
positive data from three-month evaluable NMIBC patients with CIS pooled across our clinical studies, including ADVANCED-1 Phase 1a, ADVANCED-1
EXP Phase 1b and ADVANCED-2 Phase 2 trials of TARA-002 in patients with high-risk NMIBC, including BCG-Unresponsive, BCG-Experienced and
BCG-Na ve patients. The overall three-month CR rate prior to reinduction for the 16 evaluable patients was 38 , with a CR rate of
63 in CIS-only patients and 13 in patients with CIS +Ta/T1 (T1 is defined as carcinoma invading the lamina propria). A 43 CR rate was
observed in BCG-Unresponsive/Experienced patients. TARA-002 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The majority of
reported adverse events were Grades 1 and 2 across all dose levels, and there were no Grade 3 or higher TEAEs. TEAEs as assessed by study
investigators, were in line with typical responses to bacterial immunopotentiation, and included fatigue, headache, fever and chills.
The most common urinary symptoms were urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urinary tract pain/burning, incomplete emptying and bladder
spasm. Most bladder irritations resolved in a few hours to a few days. Additional details regarding the data, which support the potential
for TARA-002 in treating high risk patients can be found in the following table:

Data cutoff date: March 19, 2024 

We expect to share preliminary
results from a pre-planned interim analysis of the ongoing ADVANCED-2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2024. The analysis is expected to
include at least 10 patients who are six-month evaluable. The BCG-Unresponsive cohort has been designed to be registrational aligned with
the United States Food and Drug Administration s, or FDA s, 2024 BCG-Unresponsive Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: Developing
Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment Draft Guidance for Industry. Trial subjects will receive an induction course of six weekly
intravesical instillations, and following mandatory biopsy at three months, will either receive a reinduction course of six weekly intravesical
instillations of TARA-002, or the first maintenance course of three weekly installations every three months, for an additional 12 months.
In addition, we anticipate sharing interim 12-month results from the ADVANCED-2 trial in the middle 2025. 

18 

In addition to the ADVANCED-2
trial, we will continue to explore systemic priming prior to initiation of intravesical administration to assess the anti-tumor activity
of TARA-002. We continue to believe that combination therapy may play a meaningful role in the NMIBC treatment paradigm and intend to
prioritize trials assessing TARA-002 in combination with other therapies. Given TARA-002 s mechanism of action and safety profile,
we believe it has strong potential as a combination agent and we continue to evaluate the best potential combination therapy options for
our clinical program. 

We also continue to conduct
non-clinical studies on TARA-002 to better characterize the mechanism of action to help us understand how TARA-002 may perform in potential
combinations with other agents used to treat NMIBC. We use non-clinical data to help us define other cancer targets for TARA-002, both
within urothelial cancer and other types of cancer affecting different parts of the body. 

We are also pursuing intravenous,
or IV, Choline Chloride, an investigational phospholipid substrate replacement therapy, for patients receiving parenteral support, or
PS, which includes both nutrition and fluids. Choline is a known important substrate for phospholipids that are critical for healthy liver
function and also plays an important role in modulating gene expression, cell membrane signaling, brain development and neurotransmission,
muscle function, and bone health. PS patients are unable to synthesize choline from enteral nutrition sources, and there are currently
no available PS formulations containing choline. Every year in the U.S. there are approximately 90,000 people who require PS at home and
of those approximately 30,000 are on long-term PS. IV Choline Chloride has the potential to become the first FDA approved IV choline formulation
for PS patients. 

In April 2024, we announced
alignment with the FDA on a registrational path forward for IV Choline Chloride in patients dependent on PS. Previously, we had been pursuing
an indication in intestinal failure-associated liver disease, or IFALD, and following feedback from the FDA, are pursuing a broader indication
in adult and adolescent patients on PS for whom oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated. The FDA has
also granted IV Choline Chloride Fast Track designation for this indication. Feedback from the FDA on our IV Choline Chloride program
indicated that a single study with an endpoint of restoring choline levels in PS patients could serve as the basis for a regulatory filing
for IV Choline Chloride. We plan to advance the development of IV Choline Chloride as a source of choline for adult and adolescent patients
on long-term PS and intend to initiate THRIVE-3, a registrational Phase 3 trial in the first quarter of 2025. 

Choline is recommended for
patients on parenteral nutrition, or PN, by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, or ASPEN, in their Recommendations
for Changes in Commercially Available Parenteral Multivitamin and Multi Trace Element Products, as well as by the European Society
for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, or ESPEN, in their Guideline on Home Parenteral Nutrition. IV Choline Chloride has been granted
Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the prevention of choline deficiency in PN patients. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued
us a U.S. patent claiming a choline composition and a U.S. patent claiming a method for treating choline deficiency with a choline composition,
each with a term expiring in 2041. 

In September 2024, we presented
the results of THRIVE-1, a prospective, observational study evaluating the prevalence of choline deficiency and liver injury in patients
dependent on PS at the ESPEN Congress. The study found that 78 of patients who are dependent on PS were choline deficient, and that 63 
of choline deficient participants had liver dysfunction, including steatosis, cholestasis and hepatobiliary injury, underscoring the need
for IV choline supplementation in this patient population. 

19 

We are also pursuing TARA-002
in LMs, which are rare, non-malignant cysts of the lymphatic vascular system that primarily form in the head and neck region of children
before the age of two. In July 2020, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation for TARA-002 for the treatment of LMs and in May
2022 the European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug designation to TARA-002 for the treatment of LMs. In addition to the clinical experience
in Japan, we have secured the rights to a dataset from one of the largest ever conducted Phase 2 trials in LMs, in which OK-432 was administered
via a compassionate use program led by the University of Iowa to over 500 pediatric and adult patients. We have an investigational new
drug application for LMs with the Vaccines and Related Products Division of the FDA, or Vaccines Division. 

In October 2023, we initiated
STARBORN-1, which is a Phase 2 single-arm, open-label, prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracystic injection
of TARA-002 for the treatment of macrocystic and mixed-cystic LMs 50 macrocystic disease) in participants six months to less than
18 years of age. Including an age de-escalation safety lead-in, the trial will enroll approximately 30 patients who will receive up to
four injections of TARA-002 spaced approximately six weeks apart. 

The primary endpoint of the
trial is the proportion of participants with macrocystic LMs and mixed-cystic LMs who demonstrated clinical success, defined as having
either a complete response (90 to 100 reduction from baseline in total LM volume) or substantial response (60 to less than 90 reduction
in total LM volume) as measured by axial imaging. We have completed enrollment in the first 3-patient safety cohort and are enrolling
the second safety cohort. 

In September 2024, we announced
interim data from the first safety cohort in the STARBORN-1 trial. Of three patients treated in the first cohort, which enrolled individuals
six years to less than 18 years of age, two patients treated with TARA-002 achieved a complete response after receiving one injection
of TARA-002; the responses were seen in a patient with a macrocystic lymphatic malformation and a patient with a maxillofacial cyst called
a ranula. The safety and tolerability seen in this cohort was consistent with that of the historical experience with OK-432 and included
TEAEs of pain, swelling, fatigue and body temperature increases. All TEAEs were mild to moderate and resolved. 

We believe TARA-002 may also
have the potential to be used to treat other maxillofacial cysts based on the historical literature from the TARA-002 predecessor, OK-432,
as well as recent data in the one pediatric patient with a ranula, which resolved nearly 100 after a single 1KE injection of TARA-002.
While completing STARBORN-1 in LMs is our priority, we believe there may be an opportunity in the future to explore the potential of TARA-002
to treat different types of maxillofacial cysts. 

We have devoted substantial
efforts to the development of these programs and do not have any approved products and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
Neither TARA-002 nor IV Choline Chloride have been approved for use for any indications. We do not expect to generate revenues in the
near-term, and it is possible we may never generate revenues in the future. To finance our current strategic plans, including the conduct
of ongoing and future clinical trials and further research and development costs, we will need to raise additional capital. See Liquidity
and Capital Resources for additional information about our liquidity and capital resource needs. 

Since inception, we have
incurred significant operating losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 232.2 million. We expect
to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses for at least the next few years as we continue our development
of, and seek marketing approvals for, our product candidates, prepare for and begin the commercialization of any approved products, and
add infrastructure and personnel to support our product development efforts and operations as a public company in the United States. 

As a clinical-stage company,
our expenses and results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We believe that
our period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as indicative of our future performance. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had approximately 81.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities. On April 10, 2024, we completed a private
placement, or the 2024 Private Placement, pursuant to which we sold 9,143,380 shares of our common stock, or the Shares, and, for certain
purchasers, pre-funded warrants, or the Pre-Funded Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 1,700,000 shares of our common stock. In each
case, the Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants were accompanied by common warrants, or the Common Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of up to
10,843,380 shares of common stock at a price of 5.25. Each Share, along with its attached Common Warrant, has a purchase price of 4.15,
and each Pre-Funded Warrant, along with its attached Common Warrant, has a purchase price of 4.149. We
received gross proceeds of approximately 45.0 million and net proceeds of approximately 42.0 million, reflecting approximately
 3.0 million of placement agent s fees, legal costs and other expenses in connection with the transaction.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates 

Our management s discussion
and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates or assumptions. 

Our critical accounting policy
is the accounting for accrued research and development expenses. We record accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical, clinical
and manufacturing development within accrued expenses which are significant components of research and development expenses. A substantial
portion of our ongoing research and development activities are conducted by third-party service providers. We accrue costs incurred under
these third-party arrangements based on estimates of actual work completed in accordance with the respective agreements. We determine
the estimated costs to accrue through discussions with internal personnel and our external service providers as to the percentage of completion
of the services and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance
of performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered. 

It is important that the
discussion of our operating results that follow be read in conjunction with these critical accounting policies which have been disclosed
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024.

Research and development
expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development expenses were approximately 8.1 million,
which represented an increase of approximately 1.9 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in clinical and non-clinical study costs related to TARA-002 of 1.5 million and IV Choline Chloride of 0.4
million. 

General and administrative
expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our general and administrative expenses were approximately 4.3 million,
which represented a decrease of approximately 0.2 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was
primarily due to a reduction of 0.6 million in personnel-related expenses (inclusive of 0.3 million of stock-based compensation), offset
partially by increases in market development, business development and investor relations activities of 0.3 million. 

Other income (expense),
net . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our other income (expense), net was approximately 1.1 million, which represented
an increase of approximately 0.3 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to higher investment
return on a higher invested balance.

Research and development
expenses . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our research and development expenses were approximately 22.2 million,
which represented an increase of approximately 3.6 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in clinical and non-clinical study costs related to TARA-002 of 2.4 million and IV Choline Chloride of 0.2
million. There was also an increase in personnel-related expenses of 1.0 million (inclusive of an 0.4 million reduction of stock-based
compensation). 

General and administrative
expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our general and administrative expenses were approximately 12.6 million,
which represented a decrease of approximately 1.3 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was
primarily due to a reduction of 1.4 million in personnel-related expenses (inclusive of 1.0 million of stock-based compensation). 

Other income (expense),
net . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our other income (expense), net was approximately 3.0 million, which represented
an increase of approximately 0.6 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to higher investment
return on a higher invested balance. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were 81.5 million and 65.6 million, respectively. We
have not generated revenues since our inception and have incurred net losses of 31.8 million and 30.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 11.2 million and 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively.
As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 76.4 million and stockholder s equity of 81.8 million. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in operating activities were 26.5 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of 31.8
million including non-cash expenses of 3.8 million, as well as working capital adjustments of 1.5 million. Since inception, we have
met our liquidity requirements principally through the sale of our common stock and preferred stock in private placements. More recently,
on April 10, 2024, we completed our 2024 Private Placement, pursuant to which we sold 9,143,380 Shares, and, for certain purchasers, Pre-Funded
Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,700,000 shares of common stock. In each case, the Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants were accompanied
by Common Warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 10,843,380 shares of common stock at a price of 5.25. We received total net proceeds
of approximately 42.0 million after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. 

We are in the business of
developing biopharmaceuticals and have no current or near-term revenues. We have incurred substantial clinical and other costs in our
drug development efforts. We will need to raise additional capital in order to fully realize management s plans. 

We believe that our current
financial resources, as of the date of the issuance of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, are sufficient to satisfy our estimated liquidity needs for at least twelve months from the date of filing this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q. 

As a result of volatility
in the capital markets, economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty, political change, global pandemics and other factors,
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital
on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, prevailing market interest
rates, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development activities. A recession or market correction,
continued supply chain disruptions and/or inflation could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 

Net cash used in operating
activities was 26.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 28.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease of 2.4 million in cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by a 5.4 million decrease in working
capital adjustments, primarily related to changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses resulting from the
timing of payments to our service providers, offset partially by an increase in net loss of 1.6 million which includes a 1.4 million
decrease in non-cash items including stock-based compensation, operating lease right-of-use asset, depreciation and amortization of premium
(accretion of discount) on marketable debt securities. 

Net cash provided by (used
in) investing activities was (3.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 38.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 41.9 million resulted primarily from a decrease of 24.7 million of marketable debt securities
matured as well as an increase of 17.2 million of marketable debt securities purchased. 

Net cash provided by (used
in) financing activities was 42.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (0.1) million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 42.1 million resulted primarily from the net proceeds of the 2024 Private Placement transaction,
which took place in April 2024. 

Contractual and Other Obligations 

Operating lease obligations 

Our operating lease obligations
primarily consist of lease payments on our corporate headquarters in New York, New York, as well as lease payments for our development
laboratory, a manufacturing facility and an additional manufacturing space, all located in North America which are described in further
detail in Note 8 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Other obligations 

From time to time, we enter
into certain types of contracts that contingently require us to indemnify parties against third-party claims, supply agreements and agreements
with directors and officers. The terms of such obligations vary by contract and in most instances a maximum dollar amount is not explicitly
stated therein. Generally, amounts under these contracts cannot be reasonably estimated until a specific claim is asserted, thus no liabilities
have been recorded for these obligations on our condensed consolidated balance sheet for the periods presented. 

24 

We enter into contracts in
the normal course of business with CROs, CDMOs and clinical sites for the conduct of clinical trials, non-clinical research studies, professional
consultants for expert advice and other vendors for clinical supply manufacturing or other services. These contracts generally provide
for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts. 

Certain of these agreements
require us to pay milestones to such third parties upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones as further
described in Note 9 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Amounts related
to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain
development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones, which may not be achieved. 

We also have obligations
to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain milestones, including future payments
to third parties with whom we have entered into research, development and commercialization agreements. We have not included these commitments
on our condensed consolidated balance sheet for the periods presented because the achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed
and determinable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have, during the
periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the applicable regulations of the
SEC. 

Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

As of September 30, 2024,
our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives,
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our principal
executive and principal financial officer have concluded based upon the evaluation described above that, as of September 30, 2024, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

We continue to review and
document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and may from
time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

25 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may
be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. We are not currently
a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.
Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources
and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There
were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024 and Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors 
of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 2, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

None. 

Item 5. Other Information 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule
10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
