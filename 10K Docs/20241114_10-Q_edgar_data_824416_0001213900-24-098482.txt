information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these interim financial statements do
not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All adjustments (consisting of normal

and negative working capital of approximately as of September 30, 2024. Because of the Company's history of losses,
its working capital deficiency, the uncertainty of future revenue, its obligations to Intelligent Partners and QF3 the low stock price
of the Company's common stock and the absence of an active trading market in its common stock and its failure to have effective internal
controls over financial reporting, as reflected in the restatement of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023,
the Company's ability to raise funds in the equity market or from lenders is severely impaired. These conditions, as well as any adverse
consequences which would result from the Company's failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the OTCQB (see Note 9), raise
substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's revenue is generated exclusively from license
fees generated from litigation seeking damages for infringement of its intellectual property rights. Although the Company may seek to
raise funds and to obtain third-party funding for litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights, the availability of such funds
is uncertain. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated unaudited financial statements and related notes
included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
See Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking
statements. 

Overview 

Our principal operations include the acquisition,
licensing and enforcement of intellectual property rights that are either owned or controlled by us or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
We currently own, control or manage twenty-two intellectual property portfolios, of which we are currently seeking or may seek monetization
with respect to twelve portfolios, which principally consist of patent rights. As part of our intellectual property asset management
activities and in the ordinary course of our business, it has been necessary for either us or the intellectual property owner who we
represent to initiate, and it is likely to continue to be necessary to initiate patent infringement lawsuits and engage in patent infringement
litigation in order to generate revenue. We anticipate that our primary source of revenue will come from the grant of licenses to use
our intellectual property as part of the settlement of patent infringement lawsuits. 

Market and Economic Conditions 

In recent years, the United States and other
markets have experienced cyclical or episodic downturns, and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, including, as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, recent attacks by Hamas on Israel from the Gaza Strip
and the resultant action by Israel against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon and the potential for broader conflict in
the Middle East, instability in the U.S. and global banking systems, rising fuel prices, increasing interest rates or foreign exchange
rates and increased inflation and the possibility of a recession. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any future economic
slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or in any industry. A significant downturn in economic conditions may adversely affect
the intellectual property licensing market including the financial condition of financing sources and the willingness of potential financing
sources to provide funding for our litigation; a law firms ability and willingness to provide us with legal services on acceptable
contingent fee terms; and the financial condition and prospects of defendants and potential defendants, which could make it less likely
that they would be willing to settle our claim. 

Further, to the extent that holders of intellectual
property rights see these and other macroeconomic factors, they may be reluctant to sell intellectual property to us on terms which are
acceptable to us, if at all. 

We seek to generate revenue from patent licensing
fees relating to our intellectual property portfolio, which includes fees from the licensing of our intellectual property, primarily
from litigation relating to enforcement of our intellectual property rights. All of the revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 was from patent licensing fees, of which approximately 83 and 100 , respectively, was paid or is payable to the patent
seller, funding sources and legal counsel pursuant to our agreements with patent sellers, funding sources and legal counsel. 

Because of the nature of our business transactions
to date, we recognize revenues from licensing upon execution of a license agreement following settlement of litigation and not over the
life of the patent. Thus, we would recognize revenue when we receive the license fee or settlement payment. Although we intend to seek
to develop portfolios of intellectual property rights that provide us a continuing stream of revenue, to date we have not been successful
in doing so, and we do not anticipate that we will be able to generate revenue from licenses that provide a continuing stream of revenue.
Thus, to the extent that we continue to generate cash from single payment licenses, our revenue can, and is likely to, vary significantly
from quarter to quarter and year to year and the net income we generated during the year ended December 31, 2023 may prove to be an aberration.
Our gross profit from license fees reflects the payment of any royalties due in connection with our license. 

It is generally necessary to commence litigation
in order to obtain a recovery for past infringement of, or to license the use of, our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property
litigation is very expensive, with no certainty of any recovery. To the extent possible we seek to engage counsel on a contingent fee
or partial contingent fee basis, which significantly reduces our litigation cost, but which also reduces the value of the recovery to
us. We do not have the resources to enable us to fund the cost of litigation. Because we cannot fund litigation ourselves, we need to
enter into an agreement with a third-party funding source. Our agreements with the funding sources typically provide that the funding
source pays the litigation costs and that the funding source receives a percentage of the recovery, thus reducing our recovery in connection
with any settlement of the litigation. In view of our limited cash and our working capital deficiency, we are not able to institute any
monetization program that may require litigation unless we engage counsel on a fully contingent basis or we obtain funding from third
party funding sources. In these cases, counsel may be afforded a greater participation in the recovery and the third party that funds
the litigation would be entitled to participate in any recovery. To the extent that we have agreements with counsel and/or litigation
funding sources pursuant to which payments made to them represent a portion of the gross recovery, and such payment is contingent upon
a recovery, our revenue from litigation reflects the gross recovery from litigation as licensing fees, and payments to counsel and/or
litigation funding sources are reflected as cost of revenue.

Agreements with QF3, QFL and Intelligent Partners 

On March 12, 2023, we entered into a funding
agreement with QF3. 

Pursuant to the QF3 Purchase Agreement, QF3 agreed
to make available to us a financing facility of: (a) up to 25,000,000 for the acquisition of mutually agreed patent rights that we intend
to monetize, of which no amounts have been received as of September 30, 2024; (b) up to 4,334,000 for operating expenses, of which
the we have requested and received 3,834,381 as of September 30, 2024; and (iii) 3,300,000 to fund the cash payment portion of
the purchase price of a patent portfolio acquired from Tower. In return we transferred to QF3 a right to receive a portion of net proceeds
generated from the monetization of those patents. We used 3,300,000 proceeds from the QF3 financing as the cash payment portion of the
purchase price of a portfolio acquired from Tower. Our obligations to QF3 are secured by the proceeds from the patents acquired with
their funding, the patents and all general intangibles now or hereafter arising from or related to the foregoing and the proceeds and
products of the foregoing. 

On February 22, 2021, we entered into a funding
agreement with QFL which was amended and restated on May 2, 2024 and a restructure agreement with Intelligent Partners. 

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with QFL,
QFL made available to us a total of 6,402,000, consisting of (a) 2,653,000 for the acquisition of mutually agreed patent rights that
we intended to monetize; (b) 2,000,000 for operating expenses; and (iii) 1,750,000 to fund the cash payment portion of the restructure
of our obligations to Intelligent Partners. In return we transferred to QFL a right to receive a portion of net proceeds generated from
the monetization of those patents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we repaid the full outstanding principal balance of
 1,525,502. No further advances are to be made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. We also granted QFL a ten-year warrant to purchase
a total of up to 962,463 shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of 0.54 per share which may be exercised through February
18, 2031 on a cash or cashless basis, subject to certain limitations on exercisability. The warrant also contains certain minimum ownership
percentage antidilution rights pursuant to which the aggregate number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the initial exercise
of the Warrant shall not be less than 10 of the aggregate number of outstanding shares of our capital stock (determined on a fully diluted
basis). A portion of any gain from sale of the shares, net of taxes and costs of exercise, realized prior to the completion of all monetization
activities shall be credited against the total return due to QFL pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. We also agreed to take all commercially
reasonable steps necessary to regain compliance with the OTCQB eligibility standards as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
12 months from the closing date, and regained compliance on May 7, 2021 and we granted QFL registration rights with respect to the common
stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We also granted QFL certain board observation rights. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
all of the net proceeds from the monetization of the intellectual property acquired with funds from QFL are paid directly to QFL. After
QFL has received a negotiated rate of return, we and QFL share net proceeds equally until QFL achieves its investment return, as defined
in the agreement. Thereafter, we retain 100 of all net proceeds. Except in an Event of Default, as defined therein, all payments by
us to QFL pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are non-recourse and shall be paid only if and after net proceeds from monetization of the
patent rights owned or acquire by us are received, or to be received. 

Contemporaneously with the execution of the agreements
with QFL, we entered into a restructure agreement with Intelligent Partners to eliminate any obligations we had with respect to the outstanding
notes and the securities purchase agreement. As part of the restructure of our agreements with Intelligent Partners, we amended the existing
MPAs and granted Intelligent Partners certain rights in the monetization proceeds from any new intellectual property we acquire. Under
these MPAs, Intelligent Partners receives a 60 interest in the proceeds from our intellectual property owned by the eight Subsidiary
Guarantors. Intelligent Partners also participates in the monetization proceeds from new intellectual property that we acquire until
the total payments under all the monetization participation agreements equal 2,805,000, as follows: for net proceeds between 0 and
 1,000,000, Intelligent Partners receives 10 of the net proceeds realized from new patents, except that if, in any calendar quarter,
net proceeds realized by us exceed 1,000,000, Intelligent Partners entitlement for that quarter only shall increase to 30 on
the portion of net proceeds in excess of 1,000,000 but less than 3,000,000. If in the same calendar quarter, net proceeds exceed 3,000,000,
Intelligent Partners entitlement for that quarter only shall increase to 50 on the portion of net proceeds in excess of 3,000,000.
The payments with respect to the new patents terminate once total payments to Intelligent Partners under all monetization participation
agreements reach 2,805,000. The payments to Intellectual Partners with respect new patents are payable from the proceeds which are allocated
to us under the QFL and QF3 agreements, which start after QFL and QF3 have received a negotiated rate of return.

We generated revenues of 900,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 250,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We generated revenues of approximately
 2,795,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 452,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. Our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generated from licenses pursuant to the settlement of patent
infringement lawsuits in the TLL, DIP, and Multimodal Media portfolios. Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was generated
from licenses pursuant to the settlement of patent infringement lawsuits in the Tyche and STX portfolios. The total settlement recovery
is included in revenue and the associated costs are deducted as cost of revenue. Cost of revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 relating to patent service costs was approximately 652,000 and 328,000, respectively. Cost of revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relating to patent service costs was approximately 1,702,000 and 613,000, respectively. The
timing and amount of our revenue is dependent upon the results of litigation seeking to enforce our intellectual property rights, and
we cannot predict when or whether we will have a recovery and how much of the recovery will be received by us after payments to legal
counsel, to our funding sources, to inventors/former patent owners and to Intelligent Partners, all of whom or may have an interest in
our share of the recovery from certain patent portfolios after deducting payments due to counsel and the litigation funding source. 

Selling, general, and administrative expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 166,000, or approximately 28 , compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to compensation expense. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 132,000, or approximately 7 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily
due to compensation expense. Our principal selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 were compensation expense of approximately 332,000 and 829,000, respectively, as well as amortization of intangible assets
of approximately 158,000 and 489,000, respectively. We had stock-based compensation costs of approximately 0 and 6,000 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Our principal operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023 were compensation expense of approximately 165,000 and 795,000, respectively and amortization of intangible assets of approximately
 203,000 and 591,000, respectively. The principal compensation expense is the salary to our chief executive officer, which was at the
annual rate of 600,000 for 2024 and 2023. We had stock-based compensation costs of approximately 10,000 and 39,000 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the amortization of the value of the options granted in a prior period. 

20 

Other income and expense for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 included a gain on change in fair value of warrant liability of approximately 67,000 and 109,000, respectively.
We recognized a gain on change in fair value of warrant liability of approximately 59,000 and a loss on change in fair value of approximately
 155,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value of the warrant liability is affected by
the price of our common stock, so the liability increases as the stock price goes up, resulting in an expense, and decreases as the stock
price goes down resulting in income from change in warrant liability. Other expense also reflects interest expense of approximately 148,000
and 414,000, respectively for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 217,000 and 571,000 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

We incurred income tax expense of approximately
 100,000 for foreign income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which primarily relates to the withholding tax in connection
with settlements of patent infringement litigations. We incurred income tax expense of approximately 30,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

As a result of the foregoing, we incurred a net
loss of approximately 591,000, or 0.11 per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss of
approximately 1,470,000 or 0.28 per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of
approximately 833,000, or 0.16 per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a net loss of approximately
 2,942,000 or 0.55 per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, we had current assets
of approximately 1,133,000 and current liabilities of approximately 11,814,000. Our current liabilities include funding liabilities
of approximately 7,134,000 payable to QF3, a non-interest bearing total monetization proceeds obligation (the TMPO to
Intelligent Partners in the amount of approximately 2,797,000 under the Restructure Agreement, both of which are only payable from money
generated from the monetization of intellectual property, loans payable of approximately 138,000, a warrant liability of approximately
 173,000, accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately 548,000, and accrued interest of approximately 1,024,000. As of
September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately 25,381,000 and a negative working capital of approximately
 10,681,000. Other than salary and pension benefits to our chief executive officer, we do not contemplate any other material operating
expense requiring cash in the near future other than normal general and administrative expenses and legal fees, including expenses relating
to our status as a public company filing reports with the SEC. 

The following table shows the summary cash flows
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

We cannot assure you that we will be successful
in generating future revenues, in obtaining additional debt or equity financing or that such additional debt or equity financing will
be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or that we will be able to obtain any third-party funding in connection with any of
our intellectual property portfolios or that we will receive any of the proceeds of any litigation settlements after making all required
payments to counsel and funding sources and payments to Intelligent Partners. We have no credit facilities. Although our agreement with
QF3 provides for QF3 to provide us with funding to acquire intellectual property rights, subject to QF3's approval, it does not provide
for financing the litigation necessary for the monetization of the intellectual property rights. We do not have any credit facilities
or any arrangements for us to finance the litigation necessary to monetize our intellectual property rights other than contingent fee
arrangements with counsel with respect to our pending litigation. If we do not secure contingent representation or obtain litigation
financing, we may be unable to monetize our intellectual property. 

We cannot predict the success of any pending
or future litigation. Typically, our agreements with the funding sources provide that the funding sources will participate in any recovery
which is generated. We believe that our financial condition, our history of losses and negative cash flow from operations, the uncertainty
of our revenue, and our low stock price make it difficult for us to raise funds in the debt or equity markets. 

As noted below, there is a substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Management believes the following critical accounting
policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets consist of patents which are
amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or statutory lives whichever is shorter and are reviewed for
impairment upon any triggering event that may give rise to the assets ultimate recoverability as prescribed under the guidance related
to impairment of long-lived assets. Costs incurred to acquire patents, including legal costs, are also capitalized as long-lived assets
and amortized on a straight-line basis with the associated patent. 

Patents include the cost of patents or patent
rights (collectively patents acquired from third-parties or acquired in connection with business combinations. Patent
acquisition costs are allocated equally across the patents in force at the time of acquisition. Patent acquisition costs are amortized
utilizing the straight-line method over their remaining economic useful lives, ranging from one to ten years. Certain patent application
and prosecution costs incurred to secure additional patent claims that, based on management s estimates, are deemed to be recoverable,
are capitalized and amortized over the remaining estimated economic useful life of the related patent portfolio. 

Warrant Liability 

We reflect a warrant liability with respect to
warrants for which the number of shares underlying the warrants is not fixed until the date of the initial exercise. The amount of the
liability is determined at the end of each fiscal period by using a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value. The
period to period change in the amount of warrant liability is reflected as a gain or loss in warrant liability and is included under
other expenses. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We account for stock-based compensation for employees
and non-employees pursuant to ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which prescribes accounting and reporting
standards for all stock-based payment transactions. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares,
options and other equity instruments. Stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as
compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. That
expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the
requisite service period (usually the vesting period). 

Revenue Recognition 

Patent Licensing Fees 

We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred
to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services. Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when there is a contract which has commercial substance which is approved by both parties
and identifies the rights of the parties and the payment terms.

For the periods presented, revenue contracts
executed by us primarily provided for the payment of contractually determined, one-time, paid-up license fees in consideration for the
grant of certain intellectual property rights for patented technologies owned or controlled by us or our operating subsidiaries as part
of the settlement of litigation commenced by our subsidiaries. Intellectual property rights granted included the following, as applicable:
(i) the grant of a non-exclusive, retroactive and future license to manufacture and/or sell products covered by patented technologies,
(ii) a covenant-not-to-sue, (iii) the release of the licensee from certain claims, and (iv) the dismissal of any pending litigation.
The intellectual property rights granted were perpetual in nature, extending until the legal expiration date of the related patents.
The individual intellectual property rights are not accounted for as separate performance obligations, as (a) the nature of the promise,
within the context of the contract, is to transfer combined items to which the promised intellectual property rights are inputs and (b)
the Company s promise to transfer each individual intellectual property right described above to the customer is not separately
identifiable from other promises to transfer intellectual property rights in the contract. 

Since the promised intellectual property rights
are not individually distinct, we combine each individual IP right in the contract into a bundle of IP rights that is distinct, and we
account for all of the intellectual property rights promised in the contract as a single performance obligation. The intellectual property
rights granted were functional IP rights that have significant standalone functionality. Our subsequent activities do not
substantively change that functionality and do not significantly affect the utility of the IP to which the licensee has rights. Our subsidiaries
have no further obligation with respect to the grant of intellectual property rights, including no express or implied obligation to maintain
or upgrade the technology, or provide future support or services. The contracts provide for the grant (i.e., transfer of control) of
the licenses, covenants-not-to-sue, releases, and other significant deliverables upon execution of the contract. Licensees legally obtain
control of the intellectual property rights upon execution of the contract. As such, the earnings process is complete and revenue is
recognized upon the execution of the contract, when collectability is probable and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Revenue contracts generally provide for payment of contractual amounts within 30 to 90 days of execution of the contract. Contractual
payments made by licensees are generally non-refundable. We do not have any significant payment terms, as payment is received shortly
after goods are delivered or services are provided, therefore there is no significant financing component or consideration payable to
the customer in these transactions. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. 

Going Concern 

We have an accumulated deficit of approximately
 25,381,000 and negative working capital of approximately 10,681,000 as of September 30, 2024. Because of our history of losses,
our working capital deficiency, the uncertainty of future revenue, our obligations to QF3 and Intelligent Partners, the low stock price
of our common stock and the absence of an active trading market in our common stock and our failure to have effective internal controls
over financial reporting, as reflected in the restatement of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, our ability
to raise funds in the equity market or from lenders is severely impaired. These conditions, as well as any adverse consequences which
would result from our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the OTCQB, raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our revenue is generated exclusively from license fees generated from litigation seeking damages for infringement
of our intellectual property rights. Although we may seek to raise funds and to obtain third-party funding for litigation to enforce
our intellectual property rights, the availability of such funds is uncertain. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any other financial
guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts
that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder s equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit,
liquidity or market risk support to such entity.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer, which positions are held by the same person.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective
disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation,
our chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer concluded that, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting, our disclosure controls were not effective as of September 30, 2024, such that the information required
to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the chief executive officer
and acting chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
In light of the restatement of our financial statements included in amendment no. 1 to our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year
ended December 31, 2023, which resulted from our failure to have effective internal controls over financial reporting, we plan to enhance
our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of
the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements keeping in mind the limitation resulting from our limited resources
and our not having a full-time chief financial officer with an accounting background. As previously disclosed, management has determined
that our internal control over financial reporting contains material weaknesses due to the absence of segregation of duties, as well
as lack of qualified accounting personnel and excessive reliance on third-party consultants for accounting, financial reporting and related
activities. The lack of any separation of duties, with the same person, who is our only full time employee, serving as both chief executive
officer and acting chief financial officer, and who does not have an accounting background, makes it unlikely that we will be able to
implement effective internal controls over financial reporting in the near future. 

During the period ended September 30, 2024,
there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
