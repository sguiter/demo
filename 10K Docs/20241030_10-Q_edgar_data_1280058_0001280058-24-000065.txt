 2024 refinancing 
 On April 30, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Amendment"), by and among us, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent (the "Agent"). The Amendment amends the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2020 (as previously amended, the "2020 Credit Agreement" and the 2020 Credit Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the 2024 Credit Agreement ), by and among us, the lenders from time-to-time party thereto and the Agent. 
 The Amendment amends the 2020 Credit Agreement to, among other things, (a) refinance the existing billion credit facilities under the 2020 Credit Agreement to provide for new credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of billion consisting of (i) a million revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Facility and (ii) a million term loan facility (the 2024 Term Facility and together with the 2024 Revolving Facility, the 2024 Credit Facilities ), (b) extend the maturity date to April 30, 2029, (c) modify the definition of Applicable Margin (as defined below) and (iv) modify certain negative and financial covenants to provide additional operational flexibility. Upon closing, we borrowed million pursuant to the 2024 Term Facility and million pursuant to the 2024 Revolving Facility and used the proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balances of the term loans under the 2020 Credit Agreement (the "2020 Term Facilities"), and repay million of outstanding revolving credit loans under the 2020 Credit Agreement (the "2020 Revolving Facility"). 
 Certain lenders of the 2024 Term Facility participated in the 2020 Term Facilities and the change in present value of our future cash flows to these lenders under the 2020 Term Facilities and under the 2024 Term Facility was less than 10 . Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt modification. Certain lenders of the 2020 Term Facilities did not participate in the 2024 Term Facility. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt extinguishment. Certain lenders of the 2020 Revolving Facility participated in the 2024 Revolving Facility and provided increased borrowing capacities. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt modification. Certain lenders of the 2020 Revolving Facility did not participate in the 2024 Revolving Facility. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt extinguishment.

million in financing costs, of which million were capitalized in other assets and, together with a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2020 Credit Agreement and prior agreements, are being amortized into interest expense over the term of the new facility. As of September 30, 2024, deferred financing costs totaling million were included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We recorded aggregate financing costs of million as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of our debt liability, which related to debt discount (fees paid to lenders) and debt issuance costs for the 2024 Term Facility. 
 Summary of the 2024 Credit Facilities 
 The 2024 Revolving Facility includes (i) a million letter of credit subfacility, (ii) a million swingline subfacility and (iii) a million sublimit available for multicurrency borrowings. 
 Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, dollar tranche revolving loans and term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company: (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus , (ii) the prime rate announced by Bank of America, N.A., and (iii) Term SOFR plus (the Base Rate ), plus an applicable margin as specified in the 2024 Credit Agreement (the Applicable Margin (b) Term SOFR plus the Applicable Margin; or (c) the Daily SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin shall be adjusted quarterly, varies based on our net leverage ratio and varies based on whether the loan is a Base Rate Loan to ), or a Term SOFR Loan/Daily SOFR Loan to ). The 2024 Credit Agreement also provides for a commitment fee of between and of the unused commitment under the 2024 Revolving Facility depending on our net leverage ratio. 
 Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, designated currency tranche revolving loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company: (a) the Designated Currency Daily Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Margin; or (b) the Designated Currency Term Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin shall be adjusted quarterly and varies based on our net leverage ratio for both Designated Currency Daily Rate Loans and Designated Currency Term Rate Loans to ). 
 We may prepay the 2024 Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to certain types of loans. 
 Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, we are entitled on one or more occasion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the 2024 Revolving Facility and/or request additional incremental term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) million and (B) of EBITDA (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement), plus (ii) at our option, up to an amount such that the net leverage ratio shall be no greater than to 1.00. 
 The 2024 Credit Agreement contains various representations, warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. Financial covenants include a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the 2024 Credit Facilities. 
 Real estate loans 
 In August 2020, we completed the purchase of our global headquarters facility. As part of the purchase price, we assumed the seller s obligations under two senior secured notes with a then-aggregate outstanding principal amount of million (collectively, the Real Estate Loans ). The Real Estate Loans require periodic principal payments and the balance of the Real Estate Loans are due upon maturity in April 2038. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the Real Estate Loans. 
 Other debt 
 From time to time, we enter into third-party financing agreements for purchases of software and related services for our internal use. Generally, the agreements are non-interest-bearing notes requiring annual payments. Interest associated with the notes is imputed at the rate we would incur for amounts borrowed under our then-existing credit facility at the inception of the notes.

 We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge revenues denominated in the Canadian Dollar ("CAD") against changes in the exchange rate with the United States Dollar ("USD"). We designated each of these foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges at the inception of the contracts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional values of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges that we held to buy USD in exchange for Canadian Dollars were million CAD and million CAD, respectively. All of the contracts have maturities of 12 months or less. 
 Net investment hedges 
 We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of our investments denominated in British Pounds ("GBP") into USD. We designated each of these foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional values of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility of the U.S. dollar value of a portion of our GBP-denominated investments was million and million, respectively.

 Our policy requires that derivatives used for hedging purposes be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains or losses from the change in fair value measurement of our derivative instruments each reporting period and the related income tax expense or benefit. Excluding net investment hedges, changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments and the related income tax expense or benefit are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the actual hedged expense is incurred or until the hedge is terminated at which point the unrealized gain (loss) and related tax effects are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to current earnings. For net investment hedges, changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments and the related income tax expense or benefit are reflected as adjustments to translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and recognized in earnings only when the hedged GBP investment is liquidated. The estimated accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2024 that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is million. There were ineffective portions of our interest rate swap or foreign currency forward derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. See Note 11 to these unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component. We classify cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

million related to the Security Incident, which included million for ongoing legal fees and a settlement of loss contingencies of million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash outlays of million related to the Security Incident for ongoing legal fees and the million paid during the third quarter of 2024 related to our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California. In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. For full year 2024, we currently expect pre-tax expenses of approximately million to million and cash outlays of approximately million to million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. Not included in these ranges are our previous settlements or current accruals for loss contingencies related to the matters discussed below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded approximately million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believed we could reasonably estimate in accordance with our loss contingency procedures described above. Our liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our unaudited, condensed consolidated balance sheets. It is reasonably possible that our estimated actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss. 
 There are other Security Incident-related matters, including customer claims, customer constituent class actions and governmental investigations, for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of September 30, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
 Customer claims. To date, we have received approximately specific requests from customers for reimbursement of expenses incurred by them related to the Security Incident, all of which have been fully resolved and closed or are inactive and are considered by us to have been abandoned by the customers. We have also received approximately reservations of the right to seek expense recovery in the future from customers or their attorneys in the U.S., U.K. and Canada related to the Security Incident, none of which resulted in claims submitted to us and are considered by us to have been abandoned by the customers. We have also received notices of proposed claims on behalf of a number of U.K. data subjects, which we are reviewing. In addition, insurance companies representing various customers interests through subrogation claims have contacted us, and certain insurance companies have filed subrogation claims in court, of which cases remain active and unresolved. 
 Customer constituent class actions. Presently, we are a defendant in putative consumer class action cases in U.S. federal courts (which have been consolidated under multi district litigation to a single federal court) and in Canadian courts alleging harm from the Security Incident. The plaintiffs in these cases, who purport to represent various classes of individual constituents of our customers, generally claim to have been harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by us in connection with the Security Incident and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys fees and other related relief. 
 Lawsuits that are putative class actions require a plaintiff to satisfy a number of procedural requirements before proceeding to trial. These requirements include, among others, demonstration to a court that the law proscribes in some manner our activities, the making of factual allegations sufficient to suggest that our activities exceeded the limits of the law and a determination by the court known as class certification that the law permits a group of individuals to pursue the case together as a class. If these procedural requirements are not met, the lawsuit cannot proceed as a class action and the plaintiff may lose the financial incentive to proceed with the case. We are currently engaged in court proceedings to

million to the State of California. This amount was fully accrued as a contingent liability in the Company's financial statements as of March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and subsequently paid in the third quarter of 2024. Nothing contained in the Final Judgment is intended to be, and shall not in any event be construed or deemed to be, an admission or concession or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever on the part of Blackbaud or any fact or violation of law, rule, or regulation. For more information, see the Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction of the State of California, County of San Diego that was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2024. 
 On May 20, 2024, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") finalized an Order (the FTC Order evidencing its settlement with us in connection with the Security Incident. As part of the FTC Order, we were not fined and were not otherwise required to make any payment. Furthermore, we agreed to the FTC Order without admitting or denying any of the FTC s allegations, except as expressly stated otherwise in the FTC Order. The settlement described in the FTC Order fully resolved the FTC investigation. For more information, see the form of proposed order that was furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2024 and is identical in substance to the final FTC Order, and in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. 
 On October 5, 2023, we entered into separate, substantially similar Administrative Orders with each of state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia relating to the Security Incident which fully resolved the previously disclosed multi-state Civil Investigative Demand and the separate Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Indiana Attorney General relating to the Security Incident. 
 On March 9, 2023, we reached a settlement with the SEC in connection with the Security Incident that fully resolved the previously disclosed SEC investigation of the Security Incident. 
 On September 28, 2021, the Information Commissioner s Office in the United Kingdom under the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 notified us that it has closed its investigation of the Security Incident.

) Effective income tax rate 
 The changes in our effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily attributable the negative impact in 2023 of non-deductible accruals related to the Security Incident that did not recur in 2024 to the same extent. Additionally, there were favorable impacts of benefits attributable to stock-based compensation. Partially offsetting these items were unfavorable impacts of our United Kingdom liability for uncertain tax positions. 
 
 million to million available for repurchases. 
 In March 2024, we entered into an issuer forward repurchase transaction with a large financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of shares of our common stock (the "ASR Transaction"). Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Transaction, we provided the financial institution with a prepayment of million and received an initial delivery of million shares of our common stock, representing approximately of the total shares then-expected to be repurchased under the ASR Transaction. The final number of shares of common stock delivered to us under the ASR Transaction will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Transaction, less a discount and subject to customary adjustments upon events affecting the common stock (e.g., dilutive or concentrative events, mergers and acquisitions, and market disruptions). At settlement, the financial institution may be required to deliver additional shares of our common stock to us or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to deliver a cash payment

million between the prepayment of million and the value of the shares repurchased on the ASR Transaction date represents an unsettled prepaid forward contract indexed to our common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification; therefore, it was not accounted for as a derivative instrument as of September 30, 2024. Because of our ability to settle in shares, the million prepaid forward contract was classified as a reduction to additional paid-in capital within our unaudited, condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. We funded the ASR Transaction prepayment with borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit loan under the 2020 Credit Agreement. 
 On July 16, 2024, our Board of Directors reauthorized, expanded and replenished our stock repurchase program by expanding the total capacity under the program from million to million available for repurchases. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased shares for million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of shares for million, including the initial delivery of shares repurchased pursuant to the ASR Transaction. The remaining amount available to purchase stock under the approved stock repurchase program was million as of September 30, 2024.

The increase in deferred revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the impact of our contract pricing initiatives within the Social Sector, as well as a seasonal increase in customer contract billings and renewals. Historically, due to the timing of customer budget cycles, we have an increase in customer contract renewals at or near the beginning of our third quarter. Generally, our lowest balance of deferred revenue during the year is at the end of our first quarter. The amount of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the deferred reven ue balance at the beginning of the period was approximately million. The amount of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was insignificant .

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis presents financial information denominated in millions of dollars which can lead to differences from rounding when compared to similar information contained in the unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes which are primarily denominated in thousands of dollars. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 We are the leading software provider exclusively dedicated to powering social impact. Serving the nonprofit and education sectors, companies committed to social responsibility and individual change makers, our essential software is built to accelerate impact in fundraising, nonprofit financial management, digital giving, grantmaking, corporate social responsibility and education management. A remote-first company, we have operations in the United States, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, India and the United Kingdom, supporting users in 100+ countries. 
 Our revenue is primarily generated from the following sources: (i) charging for the use of our software solutions in cloud and hosted environments; (ii) providing payment and transaction services; and (iii) providing Impact-as-a-Service digital educational content. 
 Business Update 
 Our company has made significant strides over the past several years by executing on our five-point operating plan. We have extended our position as the world's leading provider of software to power social impact through product innovation to better serve the very specific needs of non-profit customers, successfully implemented key revenue initiatives to enhance the predictability of our growth, all while maintaining keen attention to cost management and cash flow. As a result of this work, we have grown revenue, significantly improved our profitability, driven sustained EPS growth and generated significant cash flow, which we have used, in part, to fuel a material stock repurchase program, that was expanded and replenished to 800 million in July 2024. 
 We believe Blackbaud is a compelling investment with multiple opportunities for strong stockholder returns. 
 1. As an industry leader with what we believe is the most comprehensive set of purpose-built and mission critical software and services, we have an inherent ability to penetrate even further into a rich market opportunity; 
 2. The strength of our financial model allows us to continue to aggressively invest in innovation, which provides great value for our customers and enhances our ability to attract new customers; and 
 3. We generate strong cash flows and are committed to disciplined, value-maximizing capital returns. We believe that at current valuations, Blackbaud is undervalued, and we plan to be aggressive in the repurchase of our stock to improve stockholder value. 
 Market Opportunity 
 U.S. charitable giving in 2023 was over 500 billion, of which roughly 100 billion was donated, granted and invested through our Blackbaud platforms globally. 
 In our Social Sector, we continue to primarily focus on mid-sized and enterprise non-profits and, as market leader, we continue to see great opportunities to attract new customers as well expand our offerings to our existing customers. We appreciate that our customers have choices, too. For decades, we have enjoyed being the market leader, with strong brand recognition and significant breadth and depth of our product capabilities, but we are not relying on the success of our past.

 Investments in Innovation 
 We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and partner with our developer network to produce continuous product enhancements throughout our portfolio, including generative AI capabilities, which in turn enable our customers to raise more money while increasing operational efficiency ultimately allowing them to spend more time executing on their charitable missions and less time on administrative tasks. 
 We are a natural choice for new and existing customers alike. The alternative for our customers is a disjointed, competitive landscape where we believe other companies do not offer the combined breadth and depth of our capabilities. These include smaller, mostly disparate point solutions that address only single aspects of the complex, comprehensive technology needs of a nonprofit, or larger horizontal software companies that may lack the depth of nonprofit-specific functionality and often require complex, expensive customization and potentially additional vendors to meet customer needs. 
 Cash Flow Generation 
 During the nine months of 2024, we generated 222.4 million of operating cash flow, an increase of approximately 9.6 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. Our robust cash flow generation gives us confidence to continue investment in a number of critical areas like product innovation and stock repurchases. In March 2024, we announced that we intend to repurchase during 2024 between 7 and 10 of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2023 under our stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 3,761,985 shares for 325.4 million, representing approximately 7.0 of the Company's common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. These share repurchases do not include the final settlement of the ASR Transaction, as discussed above. The remaining amount available to purchase stock under our stock repurchase program was 737.2 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 On October 29, 2024, we settled the previously announced ASR Transaction. In connection with the settlement of the ASR Transaction, we received approximately 490,000 shares of our common stock, in addition to the 2.1 million shares received in March 2024. No cash was exchanged as part of the settlement of the ASR Transaction. We plan to continue to be aggressive in the fourth quarter of 2024 repurchasing our stock with our goal of repurchasing up to 10 of our outstanding common stock this year. We believe there is currently no better use of our capital than investing back into the business through product innovation and returning capital to stockholders around these valuation levels.

 Total revenue M) Income from operations M) 
 YoY Growth ) YoY Growth ) 

Total revenue increased by 9.1 million and 42.8 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven largely by the following: 
 + Growth in recurring revenue primarily related to: 
 increases in contractual recurring revenue of 5.6 million and 31.2 million, respectively, related to the impact of our 3-year contract renewal initiative and pricing within the Social Sector as well as the performance of our cloud solutions; partially offset by decreases in revenue from EVERFI and maintenance revenue; 
 increases in transactional recurring revenue of 5.4 million and 17.6 million, respectively, primarily due to positive results related to pricing initiatives we have implemented in the past twelve months and increases in volume for our Blackbaud Tuition Management and JustGiving solutions; also contributing to the increases in transactional recurring revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were increases related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 0.7 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 
 - Decreases in one-time service and other revenue primarily related to: 
 decreases in one-time consulting revenue of 1.8 million and 5.2 million, respectively, primarily due to decreases of 2.7 million and 5.2 million, respectively, resulting from our sale of EVERFI Limited as discussed in Note 3 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report. 
 
 As previously disclosed and discussed above, we have a number of multi-year pricing initiatives underway, some to bring our pricing in line with the market while others are model changes that are expected to drive greater revenue for both us and our customers. Excluding the impact from our sale of EVERFI Limited in the first quarter of 2024, we expect that the decline in our non-strategic one-time services and other revenue will slow in 2024 compared to the previous two years.

 Our Social Sector revenue (which represents approximately 88 of our total year-to-date revenue) increased 15.7 million, or 6.6 , and 55.0 million, or 7.9 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by the increases in contractual recurring revenue and transactional recurring revenue discussed above. The Social Sector has proven to be very resilient as demonstrated through the last several economic downturns and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have great confidence in the long-term trajectory of this portion of our business. 
 Our Corporate Sector revenue (which represents approximately 12 of our total year-to-date revenue) decreased 6.6 million, or 17.3 , and 12.2 million, or 10.7 , respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by the underperformance of EVERFI and our disposition of EVERFI Limited in March 2024 (see Note 3 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information). EVERFI has unique and valuable assets, including a comprehensive catalog of content, great customer relationships and a deep talent pool. However, EVERFI has faced a number of external challenges and while we have taken decisive actions, including changes to Corporate Sector leadership and the disposition of a non-recurring revenue component (EVERFI Limited discussed above), EVERFI continues to be a drag on our overall performance, and we expect that to continue. While EVERFI remains a small portion of our total revenue at approximately 8 , we are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for this business. We recently took actions to right-size EVERFI's business to better align costs to its lower revenues, and we hired a strategic advisor to assist us in considering a range of alternatives for EVERFI, one of which includes a potential divestiture of the business. This work is in early stages, and EVERFI remains well positioned to support its customers. We will continue to provide updates as progress is made on this initiative.

 Income from operations increased by 21.8 million and 84.2 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven largely by the following: 
 + Decreases in stock-based compensation expense of 13.8 million and 19.2 million, respectively, primarily due to overall Company performance against targets for certain performance-based equity awards, and a decrease in the grant date fair value of equity award grants 
 + Increases in total revenue, as described above 
 + Decreases in acquisition and disposition-related costs of 6.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively. For the three months ended period, the decrease is primarily related to the initial noncash impairment charges against certain operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment assets resulting from the sublease of portion of our Washington, DC office location during the third quarter of 2023 which did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended period, the decrease related to the 2023 Washington, DC office impairment was partially offset by an additional impairment due to sublease, which occurred during the second quarter of 2024 and the disposition of EVERFI Limited; see Note 5 and Note 3, respectively, to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. 
 + Decrease in employee severance costs of 5.0 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to our prior period targeted workforce reductions 
 + Decreases in Security Incident-related expenses of 3.4 million and 35.9 million, respectively, largely related to decreases in loss contingency accruals (see "Security Incident update" below) 
 + Decreases in commission expense of 2.8 million and 9.3 million, respectively, primarily due to fewer sales headcount and a prospective increase in the period of benefit over which we amortized costs of obtaining contracts with customers from 5 to 6 years beginning in the year ending December 31, 2024 
 + Decrease in corporate costs of 1.6 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to a decrease in bad debt expense and the release of certain accrued tax liabilities due to favorable state sales tax rulings 
 + Decreases in direct costs of revenue of 0.8 million and 1.0 million, respectively, primarily due to our sale of EVERFI Limited as discussed above 
 - Increases in compensation costs other than stock-based compensation of 3.6 million and 6.5 million, respectively, primarily due to an increase in resources dedicated to our cybersecurity program 
 - Increases in third-party contractor costs of 3.2 million and 6.0 million, respectively, largely related to enhancements to our cybersecurity program 
 - Decrease of 2.9 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to an increase in amortization of capitalized software and content development costs and a decrease in software and content development costs that were required to be capitalized under the internal-use software guidance 
 - Increases in hosting and data center costs of 1.8 million and 4.1 million, respectively, as we continue to migrate our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers and make investments in security; currently, we expect our cloud infrastructure migration efforts and increased level of cybersecurity investments to continue for the foreseeable future 
 - Increases in amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of 1.7 million and 5.0 million, respectively, as most the intangible assets we acquired with EVERFI in December 2021 are amortized on a curve that represents the expected period of economic benefit 
 - Increases in advertising costs of 0.8 million and 3.7 million, respectively, primarily due to timing differences compared to 2023 (for example, bbcon , our annual user conference, which was held in September of 2024 and October of 2023) and, to a lesser extent, increased digital marketing spend to drive fundraising page creation for JustGiving 
 - Increases in transaction-based costs of 0.8 million and 3.4 million, respectively, related to the increase in the volume of transactions for which we process payments and, to a lesser extent, increases in vendor rates 
 - Increases in travel costs of 0.8 million and 1.9 million, respectively, primarily due to the timing of travel related to bbcon (as discussed above) 
 
 We are continuing to make critical investments in the business in areas such as innovation, cybersecurity, and our continued shift of cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers. Our financial results through the third quarter of 2024 reflect some of these incremental investments.

 We continuously seek opportunities to optimize our portfolio of solutions to focus time and resources on innovation that will have the greatest impact for our customers and the markets we serve, and drive the highest return on investment. To that end, we will continue to simplify and rationalize our portfolio through product sunsets and divestitures of non-core businesses and technologies. 
 As a remote-first workforce company, we also continuously evaluate opportunities to shift various business units or functions to lower-cost jurisdictions, including internationally, and may do so if and when we determine that it would reduce costs without negatively impacting the quality of our products and services. 
 
 Gross dollar retention 
 
 Our recurring subscription contracts are typically for a term of three years at contract inception. A key factor to our overall success is the renewal and expansion of our existing subscription agreements with our customers. Management uses gross dollar retention in analyzing our success at delighting our customers with innovative and cloud solutions. Gross dollar retention is defined as contracted annual recurring revenue ("CARR") divided by beginning CARR with a measurement period of twelve months. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, our gross dollar retention was approximately 90 . This gross dollar retention rate was consistent with our rate for the full year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding EVERFI, our gross dollar retention during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 92 . We are continually investing in innovation, which we believe will increase gross dollar retention over the long-term. 
 
 Balance sheet and cash flow 
 At September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 34.6 million. Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, the carrying amount of our debt was 943.0 million and our net leverage ratio was 2.42 to 1.00 . 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 222.4 million in cash from operations, had a net increase in borrowings of 223.2 million, returned 325.4 million to stockholders by way of share repurchases and had aggregate cash outlays of 50.1 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software and content development costs. 
 
 Security Incident update 
 As discussed in Note 9 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report, t otal costs related to the Security Incident exceeded the limit of our insurance coverage in the first quarter of 2022 . Accordingly, the Security Incident has negatively impacted, and we expect it to continue for the foreseeable future to negatively impact, our GAAP profitab ility and GAAP cash flow (see discussion regarding non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow on page 43 ). For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net pre-tax expenses which were insignificant. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net pre-tax expenses of 12.8 million related to the Security Incident, which included 6.0 million for ongoing legal fees and additional accruals for loss contingencies of 6.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash outlays of 15.1 million related to the Security Incident for ongoing legal fees and the 6.8 million paid during the third quarter of 2024 related to our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California. In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. For full year 2024, we currently expect pre-tax expenses of approximately 5.0 million to 10.0 million and cash outlays of approximately 8.0 million to 13.0 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. Not included in these ranges are our previous settlements or current accruals for loss contingencies related to the matters discussed below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded approximately 0.7 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believed we could reasonably

 estimate in accordance with our loss contingency procedures described above and as more fully described in Note 9. It is reasonably possible that our estimated actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss. 
 There are other Security Incident-related matters, including customer claims, customer constituent class actions and governmental investigations, for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of September 30, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Recurring revenue includes two components: contractual recurring and transactional recurring. 
 Contractual recurring revenue is primarily comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud solutions, Impact-as-a-Service digital educational content, online training programs and subscription-based analytic services. Contractual recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions. 
 Transactional recurring revenue is comprised of transaction fees associated with the use of our solutions, including donation processing, tuition management, consumer giving and event-based usage.

 Cost of recurring revenue is primarily comprised of compensation costs for customer support and production IT personnel, hosting and data center costs, third-party contractor expenses, third-party royalty and data expenses, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, amortization of intangible assets from business combinations, amortization of software development costs, transaction-based costs related to payments services including remittances of amounts due to third-parties and other costs incurred in providing support and recurring services to our customers. 
 Our customers continue to prefer cloud subscription offerings with integrated analytics, training and payment services. We intend to continue focusing on innovation, quality and integration of our cloud solutions, which we believe will drive future revenue growth. 
 Recurring revenue increased by 11.0 million, or 4.1 , and 48.8 million, or 6.2 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by the following: 
 + Increases in contractual recurring revenue of 5.6 million and 31.2 million, respectively, related to the impact of our 3-year contract renewal initiative and pricing within the Social Sector as well as the performance of our cloud solutions; partially offset by decreases in revenue from EVERFI (as discussed above) and maintenance revenue; 
 + Increases in transactional recurring revenue of 5.4 million and 17.6 million, respectively, primarily due to positive results related to pricing initiatives we have implemented in the past twelve months and increases in volume for our Blackbaud Tuition Management and JustGiving solutions; also contributing to the increases in transactional recurring revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were increases related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 0.7 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 
 
 Cost of recurring revenue increased by 8.5 million, or 7.5 , and 19.1 million, or 5.6 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by the following: 
 + Increases in hosting and data center costs of 1.8 million and 4.2 million, respectively, as we continue to migrate our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers and make investments in security; currently, we expect our cloud infrastructure migration efforts and increased level of cybersecurity investments to continue for the foreseeable future 
 + Increases in amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of 1.6 million and 4.7 million, respectively, as most of the intangible assets we acquired with EVERFI in December 2021 are amortized on a curve that represents the expected period of economic benefit. 
 + Increases in third-party software costs of 1.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the number of licenses needed and also price increases for the software being used 
 + Increases in third-party contractor costs of 1.3 million and 3.1 million, respectively, largely related to enhancements to our cybersecurity program 
 + Increases in amortization of software development costs of 0.9 million and 2.0 million, respectively, due to our continued investments in the innovation and security of our solutions 
 + Increases in transaction-based costs of 0.6 million and 3.3 million, respectively, related to the increase in the volume of transactions for which we process payments and, to a lesser extent, increases in vendor rates 
 - Decreases in stock-based compensation costs of 0.8 million and 1.4 million, respectively, primarily due to estimated overall Company performance against 2024 goals 
 
 Recurring gross margin decreased by 140 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increases in cost of recurring revenue outpacing the increases in recurring revenue. 
 Recurring gross margin was relatively consistent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023.

 One-time services and other Revenue M) Cost of revenue M) Gross profit M) and gross margin ) YoY Growth ) YoY Growth ) 

One-time services and other revenue is comprised of fees for one-time consulting, analytic and onsite training services, and fees for retained and managed services contracts that we do not expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts. 
 Cost of one-time services and other is primarily comprised of compensation costs for professional services and onsite training personnel, other costs incurred in providing onsite customer training, third-party contractor expenses, data expense incurred to perform one-time analytic services, third-party software royalties, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs and amortization of intangible assets from business combinations. 
 One-time services and other revenue decreased by 1.9 million, or 22.2 , and 5.9 million, or 22.6 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by the following: 
 - Decreases in one-time consulting revenue of 1.8 million and 5.2 million, respectively, primarily due to decreases of 2.7 million and 5.2 million, respectively, resulting from our sale of EVERFI Limited as discussed in Note 3 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report. 
 
 Cost of one-time services and other decreased by 2.8 million, or 36.2 , and 7.0 million, or 29.5 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven primarily by the following: 
 - Decreases in compensation costs of 1.6 million and 4.3 million, respectively, primarily related to our sale of EVERFI Limited as discussed above and a continued shift in resources historically supporting one-time services and other towards recurring revenue 
 - Decreases in direct costs of revenue of 0.9 million and 1.8 million, respectively, primarily due to our sale of EVERFI Limited as discussed above

Sales, marketing and customer success 
 Sales, marketing and customer success expense includes compensation costs, variable sales commissions, travel-related expenses, advertising and marketing materials, public relations costs, variable reseller commissions and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs. 
 We see a large market opportunity in the long-term and will continue to make investments to drive sales effectiveness. We have also implemented software tools to enhance our digital footprint and drive lead generation. The enhancements we are making in our go-to-market approach are expected to reduce our average customer acquisition cost per customer as well as the related payback period while increasing sales velocity.

 Sales, marketing and customer success expense decreased by 3.0 million, or 5.7 , and 12.6 million or 7.9 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following: 
 - Decreases in commissions expense of 3.0 million and 9.7 million, respectively, due to a prospective increase in the period of benefit over which we amortized costs of obtaining contracts with customers from 5 to 6 years beginning in the year ending December 31, 2024 and fewer sales headcount 
 - Decreases in stock-based compensation costs of 2.2 million and 5.7 million, respectively, primarily due to estimated overall Company performance against 2024 goals 
 - Decrease in severance costs of 2.2 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to our prior period targeted workforce reductions 
 + Increases in advertising costs of 0.8 million and 3.7 million, respectively, primarily due to timing differences compared to 2023 (for example, bbcon as discussed above) and, to a lesser extent, increased digital marketing spend to drive fundraising page creation for JustGiving 
 
 Research and development 
 Research and development expense includes compensation costs for engineering and product management personnel, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools and other expenses related to developing new solutions or upgrading and enhancing existing solutions that do not qualify for capitalization, and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs. 
 We continue to make investments to delight our customers with innovative and secure cloud solutions. Research and development expenses increased by 1.4 million, or 3.7 , and 6.5 million or 5.7 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by the following: 
 + Increases in compensation costs other than stock-based compensation of 1.9 million and 5.5 million, respectively, primarily related to an increase in resources dedicated to the security-related compliance of our solutions 
 + Increases in third-party contractor costs of 1.3 million and 2.6 million, respectively, largely related to enhancements to our cybersecurity program 
 + Decrease in software development costs of 0.9 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that were required to be capitalized under GAAP 
 + Increases in allocated overhead costs of 0.7 million and 1.9 million, respectively, primarily related to increased headcount discussed above 
 - Decreases in stock-based compensation of 2.4 million and 3.3 million, respectively, primarily due to estimated overall Company performance against 2024 goals 
 - Decrease in employee severance costs of 1.1 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to our prior period targeted workforce reductions discussed above 
 
 Not included in research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 16.0 million and 15.7 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 44.5 million and 45.4 million, respectively, of qualifying costs associated with software and content development activities that are required to be capitalized under GAAP, such as those for our cloud solutions, as well as development costs associated with acquired companies. Qualifying capitalized development costs associated with our cloud solutions are subsequently amortized to cost of recurring revenue over the related assets' estimated useful life, which generally range from three to seven years. We expect that the amount of software and content development costs capitalized will be relatively consistent in the near-term as we continue making investments in innovation, quality, security and the integration of our solutions, which we believe will drive long-term revenue growth. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, Security Incident-related expenses (including legal fees, settlements and loss contingency accruals), third-party professional fees, insurance, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses.

 General and administrative expense decreased by 17.0 million, or 39.8 , and 47.7 million, or 30.9 , three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following: 
 - Decreases in stock-based compensation costs of 7.9 million and 8.0 million, respectively, primarily due to estimated overall Company performance against 2024 goals 
 - Decreases in acquisition and disposition-related costs of 6.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively. For the three months ended period the decrease is primarily related to the initial noncash impairment charges against certain operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment assets resulting from the sublease of a portion of our Washington, DC office location during the third quarter of 2023 which did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended period, the decrease related to the 2023 Washington, DC office impairment was partially offset by an additional impairment due to sublease, which occurred during the second quarter of 2024 and the disposition of EVERFI Limited; see Note 5 and Note 3 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. 
 - Decreases in Security Incident-related expenses of 3.4 million and 35.9 million, respectively, largely related to decreases in loss contingency accruals. See "Security Incident update" on page 31 
 - Decreases in rent expense and allocated costs of 1.9 million and 4.5 million, respectively 
 - Decrease in corporate costs of 1.8 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to a decrease in bad debt expense and the release of certain accrued tax liabilities due to favorable state sales tax rulings 
 + Increases in compensation costs other than stock-based compensation of 1.3 million and 3.9 million, respectively, primarily due to an increase in resources dedicated to our cybersecurity program 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense M) Percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
 
 The increases in interest expense in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to our incremental borrowings to fund our ASR Transaction and other stock repurchases. We currently expect interest expense for the full year 2024 to be approximately 53 million to 57 million. Our interest expense in connection with the variable rate portion of our outstanding debt could increase in a rising interest rate environment. See Note 8 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information regarding our derivative instruments, which we use to manage our variable interest rate risk, and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk: Interest Rate Risk (below) for more information about our variable interest rate exposure and related risk.

 Other Income 
 Other income M) 
 Percentages indicate other income as a percentage of total revenue 
 
 The decreases in other income in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, were primarily due to current year losses in currency revaluation compared to prior year gains. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest income. Interest income increased primarily due to higher interest earned on restricted cash held and payable by us to customers for our payment processing solutions. See Note 6 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information regarding our other income. 
 
 Deferred Revenue 
 The table below compares the components of deferred revenue from our unaudited, condensed consolidated balance sheets: 
 (dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Deferred revenue (1) 
 413.3 394.9 4.6 Less: Long-term portion 1.7 2.4 (28.9) Current portion (1) 
 411.6 392.5 4.8 
 (1) The individual amounts for each year may not sum to deferred revenue or current portion of deferred revenue due to rounding. 
 To the extent that our customers are billed for our solutions and services in advance of delivery, we record such amounts in deferred revenue. Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers with recurring revenue contracts in annual cycles 30 days prior to the end of each one-year period. 
 The increase in deferred revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the impact of our contract pricing initiatives within the Social Sector, as well as a seasonal increase in customer contract billings and renewals . Historically, due to the timing of customer budget cycles, we have an increase in customer contract renewals at or near the beginning of our third quarter. Generally, our lowest balance of deferred revenue during the year is at the end of our first quarter.

 Income Taxes 
 Income tax provision (benefit) M) 
 Percentages indicate effective income tax rates 
 
 The changes in our effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily attributable the negative impact in 2023 of non-deductible accruals related to the Security Incident that did not recur in 2024 to the same extent. Additionally, there were favorable impacts of benefits attributable to stock-based compensation. Partially offsetting these items were unfavorable impacts of our United Kingdom liability for uncertain tax positions. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The operating results analyzed below are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our operational performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. While we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures discussed below exclude the impact of certain transactions because we believe they are not directly related to our operating performance in any particular period, but are for our long-term benefit over multiple periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business.

 (2) Includes Security Incident-related costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 which were insignificant, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 12.8 million, which included approximately 6.8 million in recorded liabilities for loss contingencies, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 4.1 million and 48.6 million, respectively, which included approximately 0.0 million and 30.0 million, respectively, in recorded aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies. Recorded expenses consisted primarily of payments to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, as well as settlements of customer claims, negotiated settlements and accruals for certain loss contingencies. Not included in this adjustment were costs associated with enhancements to our cybersecurity program. For full year 2024, we currently expect pre-tax expenses of approximately 5 million to 10 million and cash outlays of approximately 8 million to 13 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. Not included in these ranges are our previous settlements or current accruals for loss contingencies related to the matters discussed below. In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded approximately 0.7 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believe we can reasonably estimate. During the third quarter of 2024, we paid 6.8 million in connection with our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California (as previously disclosed on June 14, 2024). It is reasonably possible that our estimated or actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss. There are other Security Incident-related matters, including customer claims, customer constituent class actions and governmental investigations, for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of September 30, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

 (3) Beginning in 2024, we now apply a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24.5 when calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the tax impact related to non-GAAP adjustments is calculated under our historical non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.0 . 
 
 Non-GAAP organic revenue growth 
 In addition, we use non-GAAP organic revenue growth, non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth on a constant currency basis in analyzing our operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, for evaluating the periodic growth of our business on a consistent basis. Each of these measures of non-GAAP organic revenue growth excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue attributable to companies, if any, acquired in the current fiscal year. For companies, if any, acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures reflects presentation of full year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period. In addition, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses. The exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods. We believe this presentation provides a more comparable representation of our current business organic revenue growth and revenue run-rate.

 (4) To determine non-GAAP organic revenue growth and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth on a constant currency basis, revenues from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated to U.S. Dollars using the comparable prior period's quarterly weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. The primary foreign currencies creating the impact are the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Euro.

 Non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow 
 Non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software and content development, and capital expenditures for property and equipment. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software and content development and capital expenditures for property and equipment, plus cash outflows related to the Security Incident. 
 We believe non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow provides useful measures of the Company's operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is not intended to represent and should not be viewed as the amount of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.

 Seasonality 
 Our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of certain seasonal variations in our business. Our first quarter has historically been the seasonal low for bookings, with the second and fourth quarters historically being seasonally higher, and our bookings tend to be back-end loaded within individual quarters given our quarterly quota plans. Transactional revenue is non-contractual and less predictable given the susceptibility to certain drivers such as timing and number of events and marketing campaigns, as well as fluctuations in donation volumes and tuition payments. Our transactional revenue has historically been at its lowest in the first quarter due to the timing of customer fundraising initiatives and events. We have historically experienced seasonal highs during the fourth quarter due to year-end giving campaigns and during the second quarter when a large number of events are held. Our revenue from professional services has historically been lower in the first quarter when many of those services commence and in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. As a result of these and other factors, our total revenue has historically been lower in the first quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year, with the fourth quarter historically achieving the highest total revenue. Our expenses, other than transaction-based costs related to our payments services, do not vary significantly as a result of these factors, but do fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to varying timing of expenditures. 
 Our cash flow from operations normally fluctuates quarterly due to the combination of the timing of customer contract renewals, delivery of professional services and occurrence of customer events, as well as merit-based salary increases, among other factors. Historically, due to lower revenues in our first quarter, combined with the payment of certain annual vendor contracts, our cash flow from operations has been lowest in our first quarter. Due to the timing of customer contract renewals and student enrollments, many of which take place at or near the beginning of our third quarter, our cash flow from operations has generally been lower in our second quarter as compared to our third and fourth quarters. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers of cash flow from operations in our third and fourth quarters are base salary merit increases, which occur in July. In addition, deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis due to the timing of customer contract renewals and student enrollments or significant acquisitions. Our cash flow from financing is negatively impacted in our first quarter when

 most of our equity awards vest, as we pay taxes on behalf of our employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards. 
 These patterns may change as a result of the continued shift to online giving, growth in volume of transactions for which we process payments, large dollar customer bookings and contract renewals, fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments, or as a result of acquisitions, new market opportunities, new solution introductions or other factors.

 Our principal sources of liquidity are our operating cash flow, funds available under the 2024 Credit Facilities and cash on hand. Our operating cash flow depends on continued customer renewal of our subscription and maintenance arrangements, market acceptance of our solutions and services, the volume and size of transactions for which we process payments and our customers' ability to pay. Based on current estimates of revenue and expenses, we believe that the currently available sources of funds and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to finance our operations, fund anticipated capital expenditures and meet our debt obligations. We also believe that we will be able to continue to meet our long-term cash requirements due to our anticipated cash flow from operations, solid financial position and ability to access capital from financial markets. To the extent we undertake future material acquisitions or investments or unanticipated capital or operating expenditures, including in connection with the Security Incident, we may require additional capital. In that context, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance our capital structure, including through potential debt or equity issuances. 
 As a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the SEC on January 14, 2022. Under this universal shelf registration statement we may offer and sell, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. Subject to certain conditions and pursuant to applicable SEC regulations, this registration statement is effective for three years from its date of filing with the SEC, or through January 13, 2025. In order to maintain uninterrupted access to the capital markets, we intend to file a replacement universal shelf registration statement with the SEC before the existing shelf registration statement expires. In that event, the existing shelf registration statement would terminate upon the filing of the replacement shelf registration statement, which would, subject to certain conditions, expire three years from such date of filing. 
 At September 30, 2024, our total cash and cash equivalents balance included approximately 15.1 million of cash that was held by operations outside the U.S. While these funds may not be needed to fund our U.S. operations for at least the next twelve months, if we need these funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate the funds. We currently do not intend nor anticipate a need to repatriate our cash held outside the U.S.

 Operating Cash Flow 
 Our cash flows from operations are derived principally from: (i) our earnings from on-going operations prior to non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount and adjustments to our provision for credit losses and sales returns; and (ii) changes in our working capital. 
 Working capital changes are composed of changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and deferred revenue. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 19.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a 47.5 million increase in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses, partially offset by a 28.1 million decrease in cash flow from operations associated with working capital. 
 The decrease in cash flow from operations associated with working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to: 
 a decrease in accrued expenses related to the Security Incident; 
 an increase in prepaid commissions and other expenses; 
 a decrease in deferred revenue largely driven by a drag on billings growth due to EVERFI; and 
 a decrease in taxes payable; partially offset by 
 fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments. 
 Security Incident update 
 As discussed in Note 9 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report, t otal costs related to the Security Incident exceeded the limit of our insurance coverage in the first quarter of 2022 . Accordingly, the Security Incident has negatively impacted, and we expect it to continue for the foreseeable future to negatively impact, our GAAP profitab ility and GAAP cash flow (see discussion regarding non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow on page 43 ). For full year 2024, we currently expect pre-tax expenses of approximately 5 million to 10 million and cash outlays of approximately 8 million to 13 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. Not included in these ranges are our previous settlements or current accruals for loss contingencies related to the matters discussed below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded approximately 0.7 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believed we could reasonably estimate in accordance with our loss contingency procedures described above and as more fully described in Note 9. It is reasonably possible that our estimated actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss. 
 There are other Security Incident-related matters, including customer claims, customer constituent class actions and governmental investigations, for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of September 30, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
 
 Investing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 56.3 million increased by 7.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 42.9 million for software and content development costs, which was down 1.8 million from cash spent during the same period in 2023. We also spent 7.2 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was an increase of 3.0

 million when compared to the same period in 2023. In addition, we used net cash of 1.2 million in the disposition of a business and 5.0 million for a minority investment in a business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net increase in borrowings of 223.2 million, primarily due to our share repurchase program, including our ASR Transaction (as defined below) in March 2024. We also paid 6.5 million in debt issuance costs in conjunction with our April 2024 refinancing. 
 We paid 56.0 million to satisfy tax obligations of employees upon settlement of equity awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 35.6 million during the same period in 2023. The amount of taxes paid by us on behalf of employees related to the settlement of equity awards varies from period to period based upon the timing of grants and vesting, as well as the market price for shares of our common stock at the time of settlement. Most of our equity awards currently vest in our first quarter. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flow from financing activities associated with changes in restricted cash due to customers decreased 263.7 million, compared to a decrease of 339.7 million during the same period in 2023. This line in the statement of cash flows represents the change in the amount of restricted cash held and payable by us to customers from one period to the next. 
 
 Stock repurchase program 
 On January 17, 2024, our Board of Directors reauthorized, expanded and replenished our stock repurchase program by raising the total capacity under the program from 250.0 million to 500.0 million available for repurchases. The program does not have an expiration date. Under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares from time to time in accordance with applicable laws both on the open market, including under trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases depends on several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
 In March 2024, we announced that we intend to repurchase during 2024 between 7 and 10 of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2023 under our repurchase program. Consistent with that commitment, in March 2024, we entered into the ASR Transaction to repurchase an aggregate 200 million of shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Transaction, we provided the financial institution with a prepayment of 200 million and received an initial delivery of 2.1 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 70 of the total shares then-expected to be repurchased under the ASR Transaction. The final number of shares of common stock delivered to us under the ASR Transaction will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Transaction, less a discount and subject to customary adjustments upon events affecting the common stock (e.g., dilutive or concentrative events, mergers and acquisitions, and market disruptions). See Note 13 to these unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information about the final settlement of the ASR Transaction which occurred in October 2024. 
 The difference of 52.2 million between the prepayment of 200 million and the value of the shares repurchased on the ASR Transaction date represents an unsettled prepaid forward contract indexed to our common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification; therefore, it was not accounted for as a derivative instrument as of September 30, 2024. Because of our ability to settle in shares, the 52.2 million prepaid forward contract was classified as a reduction to additional paid-in capital within our unaudited, condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity in this report. We funded the ASR Transaction prepayment with borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit loan under the 2024 Credit Facilities. 
 On July 16, 2024, our Board of Directors reauthorized, expanded and replenished our stock repurchase program by expanding the total capacity under the program from 500.0 million to 800.0 million available for repurchases.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 807,774 shares for 62.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 3,761,985 shares for 325.4 million, including the initial delivery of shares repurchased pursuant to the ASR Transaction and representing approximately 7.0 of the Company's common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. These share repurchases do not include the final settlement of the ASR Transaction, as discussed above. The remaining amount available to purchase stock under the stock repurchase program was 737.2 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 On October 29, 2024, we settled the previously announced ASR Transaction. In connection with the settlement of the ASR Transaction, we received approximately 490,000 shares of our common stock, in addition to the 2.1 million shares received in March 2024. No cash was exchanged as part of the settlement of the ASR Transaction. We plan to continue to be aggressive in the fourth quarter of 2024 repurchasing our stock with our goal of repurchasing up to 10 of our outstanding common stock this year. After 2024, we plan to repurchase shares to at least offset the dilution from our annual stock-based compensation and possibly beyond that amount as market conditions and our strategic plans permit. 
 
 2024 Credit Facilities 
 Historically, we have drawn on our credit facility from time to time to help us meet financial needs, primarily due to the seasonality of our cash flows from operations and financing for business acquisitions. At September 30, 2024, our available borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facilities was 547.6 million. The 2024 Credit Facilities mature in April 2029. 
 At September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities was 943.0 million. Our average daily borrowings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 939.9 million and 913.7 million, respectively. 
 The following is a summary of the financial covenants under the 2024 Credit Facilities: 
 Financial covenant Requirement Ratio as of September 30, 2024 
 Net leverage ratio (1) 
 3.75 to 1.00 2.42 to 1.00 Interest coverage ratio 2.50 to 1.00 8.37 to 1.00 
 (1) Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Facilities, the Net Leverage Ratio requirement may be increased by up to 0.50 provided we satisfy certain requirements, including a permitted business acquisition, and provided that the maximum Net Leverage Ratio shall not exceed 4.25 to 1.00. 
 Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, we also have restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends and our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. In order to pay any cash dividends and/or repurchase shares of stock: (i) no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the 2024 Credit Facilities, and (ii) our pro forma net leverage ratio, as set forth in the 2024 Credit Facilities, must be 0.25 less than the net leverage ratio requirement at the time of dividend declaration or share repurchase. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the 2024 Credit Facilities. See Note 7 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information regarding the 2024 Credit Facilities.

 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total remaining principal payments of 1.0 billion. These payments represent principal payments only, under the following assumptions: (i) that the amounts outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facilities, our real estate loans and our other debt at September 30, 2024 will remain outstanding until maturity, with minimum payments occurring as currently scheduled, and (ii) that there are no assumed future borrowings on the revolving credit loans under the 2024 Credit Facilities for the purposes of determining minimum commitment amounts. See Note 7 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. 
 Interest payments on debt 
 In addition to principal payments, as of September 30, 2024, we expect to pay interest expense over the life of our debt obligations of approximately 285.1 million. These payments represent our estimated future interest payments on debt using our debt balances and the related weighted average effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024, which includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements. The actual interest expense recognized in our unaudited, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income will depend on the amount of debt, the length of time the debt is outstanding and the interest rate, which could be different from our assumptions on our remaining principal payments described above. 
 Operating leases 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining operating lease payments of 47.0 million. These payments have not been reduced by sublease income, incentive payments, reimbursement of leasehold improvements or the amount representing imputed interest of 7.1 million. Our operating leases are generally for corporate offices, subleased offices and certain equipment and furnit ure. Given our remote-first workforce strategy and real estate footprint optimization efforts, as discussed above, we do not anticipate entering any new, material operating leases for offices for the foreseeable future. See Note 9 to our unaud ited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. 
 Purchase obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining purchase obligations of 206.8 million. These purchase obligations are for third-party technology used in our solutions and for other services we purchase as part of our normal operations. In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us. Our purchase obligations are not recorded as liabilities on our unaudited, condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024, as we had not received the related services. See Note 9 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for more information. 
 The total liability for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 was 5.8 million. Our accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was insignificant as of September 30, 2024.

 In connection with the settlement of the multi-state Attorneys General investigation, the California Attorney General investigation and the FTC investigation relating to the Security Incident, as discussed in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, we have agreed to implement and improve certain of our cybersecurity programs and tools through May 2044. The currently anticipated costs in connection with these efforts are primarily expected to be expensed as incurred. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 Approximately 16 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generated from operations outside the U.S. We do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. The accumulated currency translation adjustment, recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders equity, was a loss of 4.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and a loss of 9.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of our investments denominated in British Pounds into U.S. dollars. 
 The vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our U.S. or U.K. entities. The contracts entered into by the U.S. entity are almost always denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, and contracts entered into by our U.K., Australian and Irish subsidiaries are generally denominated in British Pounds, Australian dollars and Euros, respectively. Historically, as the U.S. dollar weakened, foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthened, foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in our revenue and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, foreign translation resulted in increases in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Though we have exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily those between the U.S. dollar and both the British Pound and Canadian dollar, the impact has generally not been material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates increased our total revenue and our income from operations by 2.1 million and an insignificant amount, respectively. We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge revenues denominated in the Canadian dollar against changes in the exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. We will continue monitoring such exposure and take action as appropriate. To determine the impacts on revenue (or income from operations) from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, current period revenues (or income from operations) from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period's weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These impacts are non-GAAP financial information and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates. We manage our variable rate interest rate risk through a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes. Our interest rate exposure includes SOFR rates. Due to the nature of our debt, the materiality of the fair values of the derivative instruments and the highly liquid, short-term nature and level of our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, we believe that the risk of exposure to changing interest rates for those positions is immaterial. There were no significant changes in how we manage interest rate risk between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Risk

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that they will meet their objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide the reasonable assurance discussed above. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 with respect to our operations, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 We are supplementing Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2024 (the Annual Report ). The following risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in that Annual Report. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 The Security Incident has had, and may continue to have, numerous adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 As previously disclosed, on July 16, 2020, we contacted certain customers to inform them about the Security Incident, including that in May 2020 we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. Prior to our successfully preventing the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and fully encrypting files, and ultimately expelling them from our system with no significant disruption to our operations, the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment that affected over 13,000 customers. Based on the nature of the incident, our research and third party (including law enforcement) investigation we believe that no data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused, or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly. 
 To date, we have received approximately 260 specific requests from customers for reimbursement of expenses incurred by them related to the Security Incident, all of which have been fully resolved and closed or are inactive and are considered by us to have been abandoned by the customers. We have also received approximately 400 reservations of the right to seek expense recovery in the future from customers or their attorneys in the U.S., U.K. and Canada related to the Security Incident, none of which resulted in claims submitted to us and are considered by us to have been abandoned by the customers. We have also received notices of proposed claims on behalf of a number of U.K. data subjects, which we are reviewing. In addition, insurance companies representing various customers interests through subrogation claims have contacted us, and certain insurance companies have filed subrogation claims in court, of which two cases remain active and unresolved. In addition, presently, we are a defendant in putative consumer class action cases in U.S. federal courts (most of which have been consolidated under multi district litigation to a single federal court) and in Canadian courts alleging harm from the Security Incident. The plaintiffs in these cases, who generally purport to represent various classes of individual constituents of our customers, generally claim to have been harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by us in connection with the Security Incident and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys fees, and other related relief. On May 14, 2024, the Court issued a memorandum opinion and order (1) denying the multi district litigation plaintiffs' motion for class certification because of the plaintiffs' failure to meet their burden of proof as to ascertainability, (2) granting our motion to exclude the multi district litigation plaintiffs' expert on the issue of ascertainability, and (3) denying the multi district litigation plaintiffs' motion to exclude our expert on the issue of ascertainability. Further, the Court denied as moot all other pending motions. On May 28, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a petition for permission to appeal under Rule 23(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (the Fourth Circuit ), and we subsequently filed an opposition to such petition. On July 30, 2024, the Fourth Circuit denied the plaintiffs' petition. This litigation remains ongoing. We are subject to pending governmental actions or investigations by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. (See Note 9 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a more detailed description of the Security Incident and related matters.) 
 On March 9, 2023, the Company reached a settlement with the SEC in connection with the Security Incident that fully resolved the previously disclosed SEC investigation of the Security Incident.

 Blackbaud, Inc. 

 On October 5, 2023, the Company entered into separate, substantially similar Administrative Orders with each of 49 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia in connection with the Security Incident which fully resolved the previously disclosed multi-state Civil Investigative Demand and the separate Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Indiana Attorney General relating to the Security Incident. 
 On May 20, 2024, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") finalized an Order (the FTC Order evidencing its settlement with us in connection with the Security Incident. As part of the FTC Order, we were not fined and were not otherwise required to make any payment. Furthermore, we agreed to the FTC Order without admitting or denying any of the FTC s allegations, except as expressly stated otherwise in the FTC Order. The settlement described in the FTC Order fully resolved the FTC investigation. For more information, see the form of proposed order that was furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2024 and is identical in substance to the final FTC Order, and in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. 
 On June 13, 2024, we agreed to a Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction with the Attorney General of the State of California (the "California Judgment") relating to the Security Incident. This settlement fully resolved the last remaining U.S. state attorney general investigation into the Security Incident. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to comply with applicable laws; not to make misleading statements related to our data protection, privacy, security, confidentiality, integrity, breach notification requirements, and similar matters; and to implement and improve certain cybersecurity programs and tools. The terms of the settlement with California are generally consistent with those to which we agreed in settling with the other 49 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia on October 5, 2023, as discussed below. As part of the settlement, we also agreed to pay a total of 6.8 million to the State of California. This amount was fully accrued as a contingent liability in the Company's financial statements as of March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and subsequently paid in the third quarter of 2024. Nothing contained in the California Judgment is intended to be, and shall not in any event be construed or deemed to be, an admission or concession or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever on the part of Blackbaud or any fact or violation of law, rule, or regulation. For more information, see the Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction of the State of California, County of San Diego that was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2024. 
 As noted above, the terms of the California Judgment, FTC Order, the Attorneys General Administrative Orders and our settlement with the SEC require that we implement and maintain certain processes and programs and comply with certain legal requirements related to cybersecurity and data protection. Any future regulatory investigation or litigation settlements may also contain such requirements. Effectively implementing, monitoring and updating these requirements has been, and is expected to be over an extended period of time, expensive and time-consuming. Our failure to do so in accordance with the terms of our agreements with FTC, the Attorneys General and with the SEC, and possibly others, could expose us to additional material liability under the terms of the Administrative Orders, the SEC settlement, or otherwise. 
 See Note 9 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for a more detailed description of the Security Incident and related matters. 
 We may be named as a party in additional lawsuits, other claims may be asserted by or on behalf of our customers or their constituents, and we may be subject to additional governmental inquires, requests or investigations. Responding to and resolving these current and any future lawsuits, claims and/or investigations could result in material remedial and other expenses that will not be covered by insurance. It is reasonably possible that our estimated or actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued. Certain governmental authorities have imposed, and others may in the future impose, undertakings, injunctive relief, consent decrees, or other civil or criminal penalties, which have materially increased our data security costs or otherwise required us to alter how we operate our business, and could further do so in the future. Although we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against the claims asserted against us, we cannot predict the potential outcomes, cost and expenses associated with current and any future claims, lawsuits, inquiries and investigations. 
 In addition, any legislative or regulatory changes adopted in reaction to the Security Incident or other companies data breaches could require us to make modifications to the operation of our business that could have an adverse effect and/or increase or accelerate our compliance costs. 
 Significant management time and Company resources have been, and are expected to continue to be, devoted to the Security Incident. For example, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net pre-tax expenses of 12.8 million related to the Security Incident, which included 6.0 million for ongoing legal fees and additional accruals for loss 
 52

 contingencies of 6.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash outlays of 15.1 million related to the Security Incident for ongoing legal fees and the 6.8 million paid during the third quarter of 2024 related to our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California. For full year 2023, we currently expect pre-tax expenses of approximately 5.0 million to 10.0 million and cash outlays of approximately 8.0 million to 13.0 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. Although we carry insurance against certain losses related to the Security Incident, we exceeded the limit of that insurance coverage in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, we will be responsible for all expenses or other losses (including penalties, fines or other judgments) or all types of claims that may arise in connection with the Security Incident, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. (See Note 9 to our unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements in this report.) If any such fines, penalties or judgments were great enough that we could not pay them through funds generated from operating activities and/or cause a default under the 2024 Credit Facilities, we may be forced to renegotiate or obtain a waiver under the 2024 Credit Facilities and/or seek additional debt or equity financing. Such renegotiation or financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. In these circumstances, if we were unable to obtain sufficient financing, we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due. 
 In addition, publicity or developments related to the Security Incident could in the future have a range of other adverse effects on our business or prospects, including causing or contributing to loss of customer confidence, reduced customer demand, reduced customer retention, strategic growth opportunities, and associated retention and recruiting difficulties, some or all of which could be material.

 Trading Arrangements Adopted or Terminated 

Adoption 11/18/24 11/18/25 Twelve 
 
 Adoption 11/20/24 5/23/25 Six 
 (1) An SEC "Rule 10b5-1(c) trading arrangement" is a trading arrangement made by a person through entering into a binding contract, verbal instruction or adoption of a written plan prior to becoming aware of material non-public information. The contract, instruction or written plan must specify the amount, price and date of securities to be sold; include the means for determining the amount, price and date of the sale or sales; and not permit the person to have subsequent influence over the sale or sales. The compliant plan must be entered into and operated in good faith, include a specified cooling off period, be certified by an authorized officer and is restricted from having multiple or overlapping plans. A non-compliant trading arrangement, or a "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," is a trading arrangement that has similar requirements to a Rule 10b5-1(c) trading arrangement except that it must be in written form and does not require a cooling off period or certification of an authorized officer and there is no restriction from having multiple or overlapping plans. 
 None of our officers or directors or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
