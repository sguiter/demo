ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial
statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. 

Certain
statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks
and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c)
anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They
are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, anticipate, 
 estimate, plan, potential, project, continuing, ongoing, 
 expects, management believes, we believe, we intend, or the negative of these
words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. 

The
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which
the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

The
 Company, we, us, or our, are references to the business of Laser Photonics Corporation,
a Delaware corporation. 

Overview 

We
are a vertically integrated manufacturing Company for photonics based industrial products and solutions, primarily disruptive laser cleaning
technologies. Our vertically integrated operations allow us to reduce development and advanced laser equipment manufacturing time, offer
better prices, control quality and protect our proprietary knowhow and technology compared to other laser cleaning companies and companies
with competing technologies. 

Our
principal executive offices are located at 1101 N Keller Rd, Orlando FL, 32810, and our telephone number is (407) 804 1000. Our website
address is www.laserphotonics.com. The Company s annual reports, quarterly reports, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments
to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ),
and other information related to the Company, are available, free of charge, on that website as soon as we electronically file those
documents with, or otherwise furnish them to, the SEC. The Company s website and the information contained therein, or connected
thereto, are not and are not intended to be incorporated into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

We
intend to continue to stay ahead of the technology curve by researching and developing cutting edge products and technologies for both
large and small businesses. We view the small companies as an attractive market opportunity since they were previously unable to take
advantage of laser processing equipment due to high prices, significant operating costs and the technical complexities of the laser equipment.
As a result, we are developing an array of laser cleaning equipment that we have named the CleanTech product line, which we believe
represents a new generation of high-power laser cleaning systems applicable to numerous material processing operations. 

Factors
and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results 

In
reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important
in understanding our financial performance. 

Supply
Chain . We are experiencing increased lead times for certain parts and components purchased from third party suppliers; particularly
electronic components. We, our customers and our suppliers continue to face constraints related to supply chain and logistics, including
availability of capacity, materials, air cargo space, sea containers and higher freight rates and import duties. Supply chain and logistics
constraints are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and could impact our ability to supply products and our customers 
demand for our product or readiness to accept deliveries. Notwithstanding these effects, we believe we have the ability to meet the near-term
demand for our products, but the situation is fluid and subject to change. 

Net
sales. Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from the previous quarter
can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers, the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our customers 
facilities. Net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new applications in the end markets that we
serve. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several
months. The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for
a period, which may then slow until we penetrate new markets or obtain new customers.

 Table of Contents 

Our
business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by end users, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials
processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive including electric vehicles (EV), other transportation, aerospace, heavy
industry, consumer, semiconductor and electronics. Approximately 92 of our revenues for first quarter of 2022 and 91 of our revenues
for the full 2021 fiscal year were from customers using our products for materials processing. Although applications within materials
processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns.
For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by end users of materials processing equipment
and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending. 

Gross
margin. Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by several factors, including net sales, production volumes,
competitive factors, product mix, and by other factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Many of
these factors are not under our control. The following are examples of factors affecting gross margin: 

As our products mature, we can experience additional competition which tends to decrease average selling prices and affects gross margin. 

Our gross margin can be significantly affected by product mix. Within each of our product categories, the gross margin is generally higher
for devices with greater average power. These higher power products often have better performance, more difficult specifications to attain
and fewer competing products in the marketplace. 

Selling
and Marketing expenses. In the first quarter of 2024, we invested in Selling and Marketing costs in order to support continued growth
in the Company. As the secular shift to laser blasting technology matures, our sales growth becomes more susceptible to the cyclical
trends typical of capital equipment manufacturers. Accordingly, our future management of and investments in selling and marketing expenses
will also be influenced by these trends, although we may still invest in selling and marketing functions to support sales sustainability
even in economic down cycles. 

Research
and development expenses. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing laser blasting technology
and equipment and develop new products, systems and applications. We believe that these investments will sustain our position as a leader
in the laser blasting industry and will support development of new products that can address new markets and growth opportunities. The
amount of research and development expenses we incur may vary from period to period.

in current liabilities. 

As
a result, on September 30, 2024, the Company had 3,879,770 in total working capital, compared to 8,262,302 of total working capital
on December 31, 2023. 

We
will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting Company. Our management
will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially
that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the
amount of time our management has to implement our business plan and may delay our anticipated growth plans. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item.

Revenues 

Revenue
Recognition- Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount
that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition
for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify
the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv)
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies
a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined
to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance
obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction
price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Refunds and returns,
which are minimal, are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Payments received by customers prior to our satisfying the above criteria
are recorded as unearned income in the combined balance sheets. All revenues were reported in net of any sales discounts or taxes. 

Inventory
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Inventory includes parts and components
that may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for excess or obsolete inventory items. Inventories
are written off and charged to the cost of goods sold when identified as excess or obsolete. If future sales differ from these forecasts,
the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change, and additional inventory provisions may be required. Because of our vertical
integration, a significant or sudden decrease in sales could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory
valuation. On December 31, 2022, we recorded 101,698 in Inventory Obsolescence. 

For
the three months ending September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue of 716,697, as compared to 1,303,205 in revenue for the same period
in 2023, a decrease of 586,508. The decrease is primarily due to the timing of orders expected to be booked in Q3 2024. 

For
the nine months ending September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue of 2,083,123, as compared to 2,944,837 in revenue for the same period
in 2023, a decrease of 861,714. The decrease is primarily due to the timing of orders expected to be booked by Q3 2024 being delayed
into Q4 2024.

We
are entering into laser equipment sales agreements with customers for specific equipment based upon purchase orders and our standard
terms and conditions of sale. 

Under
our customer contracts or / and purchase orders, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment.
Our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts.

In
addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ),
we provide the following additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP): EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results
across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial
performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise
be masked by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures. 

22 

 Table of Contents 

Accordingly,
we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and
analysis of trends in the business and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating
results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and prospects. 

These
non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to,
not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures,
because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning
exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other non-GAAP measures to evaluate
their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial
measures as tools for comparison. 

(1) 
 EBITDA
 is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management, lenders, and certain investors as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of
 some aspects of a corporation s financial position and core operating performance. Investors sometimes use EBITDA, as it allows
 for some level of comparability of profitability trends between those businesses differing as to capital structure and capital intensity
 by removing the impacts of depreciation and amortization. EBITDA also does not include changes in major working capital items, such
 as receivables, inventory and payables, which can also indicate a significant need for, or source of, cash. Since decisions regarding
 capital investment and financing and changes in working capital components can have a significant impact on cash flow, EBITDA is
 not necessarily a good indicator of a business s cash flows. We use EBITDA for evaluating the relative underlying performance
 of our core operations and for planning purposes. We calculate EBITDA by adjusting net income to exclude net interest expense, income
 tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization, thus the term Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization 
 and the acronym EBITDA. 

(2) 
 Adjusted
 EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) as reported in our consolidated statements of income excluding the impact of (i) interest
 expense; (ii) income tax provision; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) stock-based compensation expense; (v) accretion of
 debt discounts; (vi) other income - forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loan; (vii) other financing costs; (viii) loss on
 extinguishment of debt; (ix) warrant inducement expense; (x) amortization of right-of-use assets; and (xi) change in fair value of
 derivative liabilities. Our Adjusted EBITDA measure eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital
 structures (affecting finance costs), tax positions, the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)
 and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). We also exclude certain one-time
 and non-cash costs. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, and any
 such differences could be material. 

We
believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are helpful for investors to better understand our underlying business operations. The following table
adjusts Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three- and nine-months ending September 30, 2024, and 2023.

Pursuant
to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as
it is a smaller reporting Company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

We
have not utilized any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts
or interest rate swaps and futures. We believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities. We do not have
any borrowings and, consequently, we are not affected by changes in market interest rates. We do not currently have any sales or own
assets and operate facilities in countries outside the United States and, consequently, we are not affected by foreign currency fluctuations
or exchange rate changes. Overall, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not
material to our financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosures
Control and Procedures 

Under
the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), our management has
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, our
CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. Management is implementing
controls and procedures during 2024 to bring to effective. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
was no material change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
