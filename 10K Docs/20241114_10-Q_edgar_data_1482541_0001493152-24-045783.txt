CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
in Item 2, contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are
not historical fact but are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks, uncertainties, and other factors,
some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.
We generally identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, 
 expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, 
 projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, 
or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar words. All statements, other than statements of historical
fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, any projections of revenue, gross
profit, earnings or loss, tax provisions, cash flows or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies or objectives
of management for future operations; any statements regarding current or future macroeconomic or industry-specific trends or events and
the impact of those trends and events on us or our financial performance; any statements regarding pending investigations, legal claims
or tax disputes; any statements of expectation or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. 

These
forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause our
actual results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, performance, prospects, opportunities, achievements or industry results,
as well as those of the markets we serve or intend to serve, to differ materially from those expressed in, or suggested by, these forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions regarding our present and future business strategies and the environment
in which we operate. Important factors that could cause those differences include, but are not limited to: 

our
 business prospects and the prospects of our existing and prospective customers, including the decrease in new client contracts; 

our
 overall financial condition, including declining revenues, the impact of higher interest
 rates and inflation, business disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine war, Israeli
 conflict, and the supply chains on which we depend: 

the
 impact on our business from our restructuring and cost containment actions taken in the first
 quarter of 2023 and continuing thereafter; 

the
 inherent uncertainty of product development and product selection to meet client requirements, meeting client expectations, and whether
 there are or will be warranty claims; 

regulatory,
 legislative and judicial developments, especially those related to changes in, and the enforcement of, cannabis laws; 

competitive
 pressures in the CEA (Controlled Environment Agriculture) industry and our engineering service and product supply position within
 the CEA and, in particular, the cannabis growers industry; 

the
 ability to effectively operate our business, including servicing our existing customers and obtaining new business; 

our
 relationships with our customers and suppliers and reliance on a limited number of customers and suppliers; 

the
 continuation of normal payment terms and conditions with our customers and suppliers, including our ability to obtain advance payments
 from our customers; 

ii 

general
 economic conditions, our customers operations and access to capital, and market and business disruptions including severe
 weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities, financial crises, political crises or other major events,
 or the prospect of these events, adversely affecting demand for the products and services offered by us in the markets in which we
 operate; 

the
 business disruptions that are happening in the CEA industry, including bankruptcies and shifting
 market demands, that are having an adverse impact on the demand for our engineering services
 and construction solutions and, consequently, our revenues; 

the
 supply of products from our suppliers and our ability to complete contracts, some of which depend on other actors for a comprehensive
 project completion; 

changes
 in our business strategy and development plans, and in our plans for seeking strategic alternatives; 

our
 ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; 

our
 ability to raise equity and debt capital, as needed from time to time, to fund our operations and business strategy, including possible
 strategic alternatives and acquisitions; 

our
 ability to identify, complete and integrate potential strategic alternatives and acquisitions; 

future
 revenue being lower than expected; 

the
 substantial changes in the amount and current size of our backlog and our ability to convert backlog into revenue in a timely manner,
 or at all; 

our
 intention not to pay regular dividends: and 

our
ability to maintain our listing of the shares of common stock and common stock purchase warrants on NASDAQ and the price volatility and
limited trading volumes of our securities in the public market. 

These
factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this report. 

Although
we believe that we use reasonable assumptions for these forward-looking statements, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate,
and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties,
the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation
by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in Item
1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated from time to time in
the Company s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You should not place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by the
federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking
statements and projections contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are intended to be within the meaning of forward-looking
statements in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).

in net proceeds from completion of an equity offering. Based on management s
evaluation, the proceeds from the Offering will be more than sufficient to fund any deficiencies in working capital or cash flow from
operations, and the Company is confident that it will be able to meet its obligations as they come due, and fund operations for at least
12 months after the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the conditions around liquidity and limited working
capital necessary to fund operations have been addressed.

However,
we are continuing to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and other alternatives for our future. As part of that evaluative
process, and as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed on April 10, 2024, we are also considering the legal procedure and practical steps for
dissolving ourselves, which would include a distribution of cash assets after creditors and other corporate obligations have been accounted
for and satisfied. For any plan of dissolution, management and the board of directors will need to formulate and adopt a plan of dissolution.
Certain transaction opportunities, depending on their structure, and any plan of dissolution will require shareholder approval through
a proxy solicitation process. 

In
the event it is decided to implement a plan of dissolution, we then will not be continuing as a going concern for
at least 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements thereafter. Accordingly,
at such time, it would be management s position that the Company would be in substantial doubt about its ability to continue as
a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of those financial statements. 

. The reverse stock split
was effective June 7, 2024. The par value for the Common Stock was not affected. 

As
a result of the reverse stock split, all outstanding options, restricted stock units, and common stock purchase warrants were proportionately
adjusted as to number of securities and exercise prices. 

. As of September 30, 2024,
the balance in the Company s accounts was approximately , consequently approximately of this balance was
not insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on depository accounts.

and , respectively. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received payment on certain accounts receivable which it had considered uncollectible
and had provided against in full. Accordingly, we wrote back during the period in respect of these balances that no longer needed
to be allowed against. Similarly, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we wrote back in respect payments received
on accounts receivable balances that had previously been fully allowed against in prior periods.

A
contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance
obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the Company allocates the transaction price
to each performance obligation based on standalone selling price. When estimating the selling price, the Company uses various observable
inputs. The best observable input is the Company s actual selling price for the same good or service, however, this input is generally
not available for the Company s contracts containing multiple performance obligations. For engineering services, the Company estimates
the standalone selling price by reference to certain physical characteristics of the project, such as facility size and mechanical systems
involved, which are indicative of the scope and complexity of the mechanical engineering services to be provided. For equipment sales,
the standalone selling price is determined by forecasting the expected costs of the equipment and components and then adding an appropriate
margin, based on a range of acceptable margins established by management. Depending on the nature of the performance obligations, the
Company may use a combination of different methods and observable inputs if certain performance obligations have highly variable or uncertain
standalone selling prices. Once the selling prices are determined, the Company applies the relative values to the total contract consideration
and estimates the amount of the transaction price to be recognized as each promise is fulfilled. 

Generally,
satisfaction occurs when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer or as services are rendered or completed in exchange
for consideration in an amount for which the Company expects to be entitled. The Company recognizes revenue for the sale of goods when
control transfers to the customer, which primarily occurs at the time of shipment. The Company has elected to exclude from the measurement
of the transaction price all taxes (e.g., sales, use, value added, and certain excise taxes) that are assessed by a governmental authority
in connection with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the customer. Accordingly, the Company
recognizes revenue net of sales taxes. The revenue and cost for freight and shipping is recorded when control over the sale of goods
passes to the Company s customers. 

The
Company also has performance obligations to perform certain engineering services that are satisfied over a period of time. Revenue is
recognized from this type of performance obligation as services are rendered based on the percentage completion towards certain specified
milestones. 

The
Company offers assurance-type warranties for its products and products manufactured by others to meet specifications defined by the contracts
with customers and does not have any material separate performance obligations related to these warranties. The Company maintains a warranty
reserve based on historical warranty costs. 

Disaggregation
of Revenue 

In
accordance with ASC 606-10-50-5 through 6, the Company considered the appropriate level of disaggregated revenue information that depicts
how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Additionally, per the implementation
guidance in ASC 606-10-55-90 through 91, the Company also considered (a) disclosures presented outside of the financial statements such
as earnings releases and investor presentations, (b) information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker for evaluating
the financial performance of operating segments and (c) other information that is similar to the types of information identified in (a)
and (b) and that is used by the Company or users of the Company s financial statements to evaluate financial performance or make
resource allocation decisions. Finally, we considered the examples of categories found in the guidance that might be appropriate, including:
(a) type of good or service (major product lines), (b) geographical region (country or region), (c) market or type of customer (government
or non-government customers), (d) type of contract (fixed-price or time-and-materials), (e) contract duration (short- or long-term),
(f) timing of transfer of goods or services (point-in-time or over time) and (g) sales channels (direct to customers or through intermediaries). 

Based
on the aforementioned guidance and considerations, the Company determined that disaggregation of revenue by equipment sales, engineering
and other services, shipping and handling, and forfeited non-refundable customer deposits was required.

Other
Judgments and Assumptions 

The
Company typically receives customer payments in advance of its performance of services or transfers of goods. Applying the practical
expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18, which the Company has elected, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the
effects of a significant financing component since the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company
transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Accordingly,
the remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts does not consider the effects of the time value of money. 

Applying
the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred
since the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs include
certain sales commissions and incentives, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and are payable only when
associated revenue has been collected and earned by the Company. 

Contract
Assets and Contract Liabilities 

Contract
assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to
payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. The Company receives payments from customers based
on the terms established in its contracts. 

Contract
assets include unbilled amounts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer and the right of payment is conditional,
subject to completing a milestone, such as a phase of a project. The Company typically does not have material amounts of contract assets
since revenue is recognized as control of goods are transferred or as services are performed. Contract assets increased by in
2023, due to revenue recognition related to the partial satisfaction of performance obligations, on three contracts with one customer,
for which we have not yet billed out customer. In accordance with ASU No. 2016-13 (as amended), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments, which the Company adopted on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2023, an
allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against the Company s contract assets by applying an expected credit loss model.
Each period, management assesses the appropriateness of the level of allowance for credit losses by considering credit risk inherent
within its contract assets as of the end of the period. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts

Contract
liabilities consist of advance payments in excess of revenue recognized. The Company s contract liabilities are recorded as a current
liability in deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets since the Company generally expects to recognize revenue in less than
one year. Non-refundable customer deposits are recognized as revenue when previously abandoned customer contracts have been forfeited
and a period of three years has passed. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, deferred revenue, which was classified as a
current liability, was and , respectively. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of and , respectively, related to the deferred
revenue at January 1, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of and ,

Remaining
Performance Obligations 

Remaining
performance obligations, or backlog, represents the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining obligations
that the Company has not performed under its customer contracts. The Company has elected not to use the optional exemption in ASC 606-10-50-14,
which exempts an entity from such disclosures if a performance obligation is part of a contract with an original expected duration of
one year or less. Accordingly, the information disclosed about remaining performance obligations includes all customer contracts, including
those with an expected duration of one year or less. 

Industry
uncertainty, project financing concerns, and the licensing and qualification of our prospective customers, which are out of the Company s
control, make it difficult for the Company to predict when it will recognize revenue on its remaining performance obligations. There
are risks that the Company may not realize the full contract value on customer projects in a timely manner or at all, and completion
of a customer s cultivation facility project is dependent upon the customer s ability to secure funding and real estate,
obtain a license and then build their cultivation facility so they can take possession of the equipment. Accordingly, the time it takes
for customers to complete a project, which corresponds to when the Company is able to recognize revenue, is driven by numerous factors
including: (i) the large number of first-time participants interested in the indoor cannabis cultivation business; (ii) the complexities
and uncertainties involved in obtaining state and local licensure and permitting; (iii) local and state government delays in approving
licenses and permits due to lack of staff or the large number of pending applications, especially in states where there is no cap on
the number of cultivators; (iv) the customer s need to obtain cultivation facility financing; (v) the time needed, and coordination
required, for our customers to acquire real estate and properly design and build the facility (to the stage when climate control systems
can be installed); (vi) the large price tag and technical complexities of the climate control and air sanitation system; (vii) the availability
of power; and (viii) delays that are typical in completing any construction project. Further, based on the current economic climate,
t and the Company s recent cost cutting measures, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to fulfill its backlog, and
the Company may experience contract cancellations, project scope reductions and project delays. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining performance obligations, or backlog, was approximately , a decrease of 
from the September 30, 2023 backlog of . The decline was primarily the result of revenue recognition against our prior backlog
and cancellations. The Company has entered into fewer new contracts generally, and they have been for smaller amounts. There is significant
uncertainty regarding the timing of the Company s recognition of revenue on its remaining performance obligations, and there is
no certainty that these will result in actual revenues.

In
November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). ASU
2023-07 includes requirements that an entity disclose the title of the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and on an interim and annual
basis, significant segment expenses and the composition of other segment items for each segment s reported profit. The standard
also permits disclosure of additional measures of segment profit. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
ASU 2023-07 on its disclosures. 

In
December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, which defers the sunset date of Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of
the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.
ASU No. 2022-06 was effective upon issuance. Topic 848 provides temporary optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the
potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting, providing optional expedients
and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain
criteria are met. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows
and financial position. 

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have
a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated
to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

pays the actual amounts for property taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance. The New Facility Lease agreement contains customary
events of default, representations, warranties, and covenants. 

Upon
commencement of the New Facility Lease, the Company recognized on the balance sheet an operating lease right-of-use asset and lease liability
in the amount of . The lease liability was initially measured as the present value of the unpaid lease payments at commencement
and the ROU asset was initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. The renewal
option to extend the New Facility Lease is not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability, as the option is not reasonably
certain to be exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal option and when it is reasonably certain of exercise, the Company
will include the renewal period in its lease term.

to deny all the Claims and has asserted a counterclaim. The Company believes Claimant is owed nothing as the Company fulfilled all its
obligations under the contracts to Claimant, and further, that the negligence of a third-party supplier is the basis of the Claims. We
intend to generally defend the claims on the basis that we promptly addressed all problems, and that any issues with defective HVAC equipment

From
time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims. Litigation can be expensive
and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and the Company s
view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as
incurred. The Company records a liability for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of the loss is known. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company s operations
or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation
undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than change, by value, in its equity ownership
over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change
tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Our sale of securities, both in September 2021 and February
2022, will need to be considered for determination of any ownership change that we have undergone during a determination
period. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm
our future bottom-line operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. 

The
Company must assess the likelihood that its net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent the
Company believes that recovery is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. Management s judgment is required
in determining the Company s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded
against the net deferred tax assets. The Company recorded a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Based on the available evidence, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will not be able to utilize its net deferred
tax assets in the foreseeable future. The Company intends to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support
the reversal of such valuation allowances. The Company makes estimates and judgments about its future taxable income that are based on
assumptions that are consistent with the Company s plans. Should the actual amounts differ from the Company s estimates,
the carrying value of the Company s deferred tax assets could be materially impacted.

the current uncertainty around estimability and success of the Claims, we have not recorded an accrual for any potential loss related
to this matter. 

Q3
2021 Warrants Issued to Series B Preferred Placement Agent 

In
connection with the sale of the shares of convertible Series B Preferred Stock described above, the Company issued warrants to
the placement agent and its designees. Half of the warrants were issued on September 28, 2021, and the second half were issued on November
3, 2021, and are exercisable commencing February 28, 2022 and May 3, 2022, respectively, until September 28, 2024 and November 3, 2024,
respectively. The exercise price per share of the warrants is , subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and other
typical adjustments and changes in capitalization, including mergers and acquisitions and distribution of rights. Accordingly, 
of these warrants expired, unexercised, on September 28, 2024. The remaining warrants expired unexercised on November 3, 2024.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices, and the transactions
underlying our financial results, as well as with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and
other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to the factors discussed under Cautionary Statements 
appearing elsewhere herein and the risks and uncertainties described or identified in Item 1A Risk Factors in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated from time to time in the Company s filings with the
SEC, and Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report entitled Risk Factors. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

To
supplement our financial results on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures
including net bookings, backlog, as well as adjusted net income (loss) which reflects adjustments for certain non-cash expenses such
as stock-based compensation, certain debt-related items and depreciation expense. We believe these non-GAAP measures are helpful in understanding
our past performance and are intended to aid in evaluating our potential future results. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures
should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial
information prepared or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way to
view aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting
our business. For purposes of this Quarterly Report, (i) adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted operating income
(loss) mean GAAP net income (loss) and operating income (loss), respectively, after adjustment for non-cash equity compensation
expense, debt-related items and depreciation expense, and (ii) net bookings means new sales contracts executed during the
quarter for which we received an initial deposit, net of any adjustments including cancellations and change orders during the quarter. 

Our
backlog, remaining performance obligations and net bookings may not be indicative of future operating results, and our customers may
attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for a number of reasons, including delays in or inability to obtain project financing
or licensing or abandonment of the project entirely. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that contracts included in the backlog or
remaining performance obligations will actually generate revenues or when the actual revenues will be generated. 

Overview 

CEA
Industries, through our subsidiary, Surna Cultivation Technologies LLC, is focused on selling environmental control and other technologies
and services to the Controlled Environment Agriculture CEA industry. The CEA industry aims to optimize
the use of horticultural resources such as water, energy, space, capital, and labor, to create an agriculture business that is more efficient
and more productive than those that use traditional farming methods. Typically, the CEA industry is focused on indoor agriculture and
vertical farming. 

Headquartered
in Colorado, we aim to provide customers with a variety of value-added technology solutions that help improve their overall crop quality
and yield, optimize energy and water efficiency, and satisfy the evolving state and local codes, permitting and regulatory requirements.
We do this by offering our customers a variety of service and product offerings that include: (i) air handling equipment and systems,
(ii) air sanitation products, (iii) LED lighting, and (iv) benching and racking solutions for indoor cultivation. 

CEA
growers currently face a challenging business environment that includes high energy costs, water usage and conservation issues, continuously
evolving waste removal regulations, inflationary pressures, and labor shortages. In addition to these issues, our cannabis growing customers
face increasingly rigorous quality standards and declining cannabis prices in a growing industry whose standards are constantly evolving.
The part of the CEA industry focused on by the Company has been food related crops, a segment that is also facing disruption from evolving
market demand, competition, and reorganization, including the lack of growth capital and several noteworthy bankruptcies.

Impact
of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business 

The
impact of the government and the business economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected demand across the majority of our markets
and disrupted workflow and completion schedules on projects. We believe we continue to have adverse effects on our sales, project implementation,
supply chain infrastructure, operating margins, costs, and working capital, as a result of the pandemic. Due to this uncertainty, we
continue to monitor costs and continue to take actions to reduce costs in order to mitigate the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
to the best of our ability. However, these actions may not be sufficient in the long run to avoid reduced sales, increased losses, and
reduced operating cash flows in our business. During the year ended December 31, 2023, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company experienced delays in the receipt of equipment it had ordered to meet its customer orders due to disruption and delays in
its supply chain. Consequently, our revenue recognition of some customer sales has been delayed until future periods when the shipment
of orders can be completed. 

Impact
of Ukrainian and Israeli Conflicts 

We
believe that the conflicts involving Ukraine and Israel do not have any direct impact on our operations, financial condition, or financial
reporting. We believe the conflicts will have only a general impact on our operations in the same manner as it is having a general impact
on all businesses that have their operations limited to North America resulting from international sanction and embargo regulations,
possible shortages of goods and goods incorporating parts that may be supplied from countries involved in the conflicts, supply chain
challenges, and the international and US domestic inflation resulting from the conflict and government spending in relation to the conflicts.
As our operations are related only to the North American controlled agricultural industry, largely within the cannabis space, we do not
believe we will be specifically targeted for cyber-attacks related to the conflicts. We have no operations in the countries directly
involved in the conflict or are specifically impacted by any of the sanctions and embargoes specifically related to those conflicts,
as we principally operate in the United States and Canada. We do not believe that the conflicts will have any impact on our internal
control over financial reporting. Other than general securities market trends, we do not have reason to believe that investors will evaluate
the company as having special risks or exposures related to the conflicts. 

Our
Bookings, Backlog and Revenue 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we executed new sales contracts with a total contract value of 516,000. During this same
period, we had no change orders or cancellations. Consequently, our net bookings in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 516,000,
representing a decrease of 924,000 (or 64 from net bookings of 1,440,000 in the second quarter of 2024. 

Our
backlog at September 30, 2024 was 352,000, an increase of 125,000, or 55 , from our backlog of 227,000 at June 30, 2024. The
increase in backlog is primarily the result of bookings in the third quarter that have not yet been fulfilled. While we expect to
recognize all the revenue from the remaining backlog in 2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of the
Company s recognition of revenue on its remaining performance obligations, and there is no certainty that these will result in
actual revenues. Therefore, investors should not view backlog as earned revenue. 

Our
backlog has significantly declined since the January 1, 2023 backlog of 5,578,000. The primary reason for the decline has been fewer
new order bookings and contract cancellations. 

The
following table sets forth: (i) our beginning backlog (the remaining contract value of outstanding sales contracts for which we have
received an initial deposit as of the previous period), (ii) our net bookings for the period (new sales contracts executed during the
period for which we received an initial deposit, net of any adjustments including cancellations and change orders during the period),
(iii) our recognized revenue for the period, and (iv) our ending backlog for the period (the sum of the beginning backlog and net bookings,
less recognized revenue). Based on the current economic climate and our cost cutting measures, there is no assurance that we will be
able to continue to obtain the level of bookings that we have had in the past and or fulfill our current backlog, and we may experience
contract cancellations, project scope reductions and project delays. 

27 

Our
recognized revenue for the quarters ended September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024,
in the table below, excludes 29,000, 0, 31,000, 12,000, and 0, respectively, in revenue arising from the forfeiture of non-refundable
deposits from former customers on previously cancelled contracts. The contracts were removed from the backlog at the time of cancellation.

The
completion of a customer s new build facility project is dependent upon the customer s ability to secure funding and real
estate, obtain a license and then build their cultivation facility so they can take possession of the equipment. Accordingly, the time
it takes for these customers to complete a new build project, which corresponds to when we are able to recognize revenue, is driven by
numerous factors including: (i) the large number of first-time participants interested in the indoor cannabis cultivation business; (ii)
the complexities and uncertainties involved in obtaining state and local licensure and permitting; (iii) local and state government delays
in approving licenses and permits due to lack of staff or the large number of pending applications, especially in states where there
is no cap on the number of cultivators; (iv) the customer s need to obtain cultivation facility financing; (v) the time needed,
and coordination required, for our customers to acquire real estate and properly design and build the facility (to the stage when climate
control systems can be installed); (vi) the large price tag and technical complexities of the climate control and air sanitation systems;
(vii) the availability of power; and (viii) delays that are typical in completing any construction project. 

As
has historically been the case for the Company at each quarter-end, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing of revenue
recognition of our backlog as of September 30, 2024. 

We
have provided an estimate in our condensed consolidated financial statements for when we expect to recognize revenue on our remaining
performance obligations (i.e., our Q3 2024 backlog), using separate time bands, with respect to engineering only paid contracts and partial
equipment paid contracts. There continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the timing of our recognition of revenue on our Q3
2024 backlog. Refer to the Revenue Recognition section of Note 1 in our condensed consolidated financial statements, included
as part of this Quarterly Report for additional information on our estimate of future revenue recognition on our remaining performance
obligations. 

Our
backlog, remaining performance obligations, and net bookings may not be indicative of future operating results, and our customers may
attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for a number of reasons, including delays in or inability to obtain project financing
or licensing or abandonment of the project entirely. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that contracts included in backlog or remaining
performance obligations will generate revenues or when the revenues will be generated. Net bookings and backlog are considered non-GAAP
financial measures, and therefore, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, our GAAP measures for recognized
revenue, deferred revenue, and remaining performance obligations. Further, we can provide no assurance as to the profitability of our
contracts reflected in remaining performance obligations, backlog and net bookings.

Results
of Operations 

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenues
and Cost of Goods Sold 

Revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 391,000, compared to 914,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing
a decrease of 523,000, or 57 . The decrease was primarily due to lower bookings and a reduced backlog over the past 18 months. 

Cost
of revenue decreased by 557,000 or 55 , from 1,018,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 461,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue, along with a decrease in fixed and other variable
costs, as discussed below. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gross loss of 70,000 compared to a gross loss of 104,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 34,000 or 33 . Our gross loss margin increased by 7 percentage points from 11 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 to 18 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower revenue, an increase in fixed
costs as a percent of revenue, offset by lower variable costs, as described below. Additionally, total revenue in the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included 0 and 29,000, respectively, from forfeited, non-refundable deposits from former
customers on previously cancelled contracts. 

Our
fixed costs (which include engineering, service, manufacturing and project management salaries and benefits and manufacturing overhead)
totaled 183,000, or 47 of total revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 292,000, or 32 of total revenue,
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 109,000 was due to a decrease in salaries and benefits of 91,000 and
a decrease in fixed overhead of 18,000. 

Our
variable costs (which include the cost of equipment, outside engineering costs, shipping and handling, travel and warranty costs) totaled
 278,000, or 71 of total revenue, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 726,000, or 80 of total revenue,
in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in variable costs was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in equipment costs
of 240,000 driven by lower revenue, (ii) a decrease of 70,000 for outside engineering services, (iii) a decrease in warranty expense
of 56,000, due to a reduction in the warranty accrual as a result of lower revenue during the past 18 months, (iv) a decrease in excess
and obsolete inventory expense of 52,000, (v) a reduction in travel of 22,000, and (vi) lower shipping and handling and other expenses
of 8,000. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses decreased to 677,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 703,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 26,000, or 4 . The operating expense decrease consisted of: (i) a decrease in selling, general and administrative
expenses SG A expenses of 5,000, and (ii) a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses of 21,000. These decreases
are the result of our cost-cutting measures. 

Our
decrease in SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was
primarily due to: (i) a decrease of 133,000 in salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation) and other employee related
costs, (ii) a decrease for investor relations expense of 11,000, and (iii) a decrease of 9,000 for facility and office expense, partially
offset by (iv) an increase of 134,000 for accounting and other professional fees, (v) a 7,000 increase for insurance, (vi) an
increase in sales related expenses of 4,000 due to outside sales referral fees, and (vii) an increase of 3,000 for business taxes and licenses. 

The
decrease in advertising and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) a decrease in advertising and promotion of 20,000, and (ii)
a decrease of 1,000 for outside services and web development. 

Operating
Loss 

We
recognized an operating loss of 747,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an operating loss of 807,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 60,000 or 7 . The operating loss for the three months ended September 30,
2024 included 4,000 of depreciation expense, compared to 15,000 of non-cash, stock-based compensation, and 7,000 of depreciation expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding these non-cash items, our operating loss decreased by 42,000. 

29 

Other
Income (Expense) 

We
recognized other income (net) of 6,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income (net) of 8,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income for both periods consisted of interest income from a money market account. 

Net
Loss 

Overall,
we recognized a net loss of 740,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 799,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 59,000 or 7 . The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 4,000
of depreciation expense, compared to 15,000 of non-cash, stock-based compensation, and 7,000 of depreciation expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding these non-cash items, our operating loss decreased by 41,000. 

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Revenues
and Cost of Goods Sold 

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,386,000, compared to 6,660,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing
a decrease of 4,274,000, or 64 . The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bookings in the last 18 months. We believe the lower
bookings are due to the delay of capital expenditures in the cannabis market environment as a result of the prolonged effects of pricing
and inflationary pressure, in addition to a reduced sales effort by the Company. 

Cost
of revenue decreased by 3,401,000 or 58 , from 5,832,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2,431,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue, along with a decrease in fixed and other variable
costs, as discussed below. 

Our
gross loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 45,000 compared to a gross profit of 828,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 873,000 or 105 . Our gross profit margin decreased by 14 percentage points from 12 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, to a gross loss margin of 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower revenue and
an increase in fixed and other variable costs as a percentage of revenue, as described below. Additionally, total revenue in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included 44,000 and 234,000, respectively, from forfeited, non-refundable deposits
from former customers on previously cancelled contracts. 

Our
fixed costs (which include engineering, service, manufacturing and project management salaries and benefits and manufacturing overhead)
totaled 643,000, or 27 of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,002,000, or 15 of total revenue,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 359,000 was due to a decrease in salaries and benefits (including stock-based
compensation) of 310,000 and a decrease in fixed overhead of 49,000. 

Our
variable costs (which include the cost of equipment, outside engineering costs, shipping and handling, travel and warranty costs) totaled
 1,788,000, or 75 of total revenue, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4,830,000, or 73 of total revenue,
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in variable costs was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in equipment costs of
 2,664,000 driven by lower revenue and lower equipment margins, (ii) a decrease in warranty expense of 193,000 due to a reduction in
the warranty accrual as a result of lower revenue during the past 18 months, (iii) a decrease of 74,000 in excess and obsolete inventory
expense, (iv) a decrease of 45,000 for travel expenses, and (v) reduced outside engineering services expense of 44,000, and (vi) a
decrease in shipping and handling and other variable costs of 22,000. 

30 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses decreased to 2,103,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2,786,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 683,000, or 25 . The operating expense decrease consisted of: (i) a decrease in selling, general and administrative
expenses SG A expenses of 363,000, (ii) a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses of 243,000, and (iii)
a decrease in product development of 77,000. These decreases are the result of our cost-cutting measures. 

Our
decrease in SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was
primarily due to: (i) a decrease of 465,000 in salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation) and other employee related
costs, (ii) a decrease in facilities and offices expenses of 42,000, (iii) a decrease in bad debt expense of 38,000, (iv) a reduction
in commissions and other sales related expenses of 17,000, (v) a decrease of 7,000 for travel, and (vi) a decrease in depreciation
expense of 5,000. These decreases were offset by (i) an increase of 151,000 for accounting and other professional fees, (ii) an increase
of 30,000 in business taxes and licenses primarily due to an increase for real estate taxes, (iii) an increase in investor relations
expense of 17,000, and (iv) an increase for loss on the disposal of fixed assets of 12,000. 

The
decrease in advertising and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) a decrease in salaries and benefits (including stock compensation)
of 133,000, (ii) a decrease in advertising and promotion of 94,000, (iii) a decrease in outside services and other marketing expenses
of 14,000, and (iv) a reduction in trade show related costs of 2,000. 

The
decrease in product development costs was due to (i) a decrease in salaries and benefits (including stock-based compensation) of 70,000,
(ii) a decrease of 4,000 for materials and other R D costs, and (iii) a decrease in travel of 2,000. 

Operating
Loss 

We
recognized an operating loss of 2,148,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an operating loss of 1,958,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 190,000 or 10 . The operating loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 included 69,000 of non-cash, stock-based compensation, and 14,000 of depreciation expense, compared to 177,000 of non-cash,
stock-based compensation, and 20,000 of depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding these non-cash
items, our operating loss increased by 303,000. This increase in operating loss was primarily due to a significant decrease in revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as an increase in fixed
and variable costs as a percent of revenue. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

We
recognized other income (net) of 20,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income (net) of 34,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of interest income on our
money market account. Other income for nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of interest income on a money market
account of 26,000 and an adjustment to our ERC credit and unclaimed property of 8,000. 

Net
Loss 

Overall,
we recognized a net loss of 2,127,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 1,924,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 203,000 or 11 . The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included
 69,000 of non-cash, stock-based compensation, and 14,000 of depreciation expense, compared to 177,000 of non-cash, stock-based compensation,
 20,000 of depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding these non-cash items, our net loss increased
by 317,000. This increase in net loss was primarily due to a significant decrease in revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 along with an increase in fixed and variable costs as a percent of revenue.

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash,
Cash Equivalents 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10,295,000, compared to cash and cash equivalents of 12,508,000 as of December
31, 2023. The 2,213,000 decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was the result of cash
used in operations. Our cash is held in bank depository accounts in a financial institution. During the nine months ended September 30,
2024, we held deposits in this financial institution that exceeded the federally insured amount. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts) of 71,000, contract assets (net of allowance
for doubtful accounts) of 224,000, inventory (net of excess and obsolete allowance) of 25,000, and prepaid expenses and other assets
of 421,000 (including 128,000 in advance payments on inventory purchases). While we typically require advance payment before we commence
engineering services or ship equipment to our customers, we have made exceptions requiring us to record accounts receivable, which carry
a risk of non-collectability especially since most of our customers are funded on an as-needed basis to complete facility construction. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total accounts payable and accrued expenses of 364,000, deferred revenue of 469,000, and the current
portion of operating lease liability of 133,000. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 10,071,000, compared to working
capital of 12,110,000 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in our working capital was primarily related to (i) a decrease in cash of
 2,213,000, (ii) a decrease in inventory (net) of 272,000, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
of 261,000, (iv) an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 108,000, (v) an increase in accounts receivable of 53,000, and
(v) a decrease in deferred revenue of 31,000. 

We
currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business. We have never declared
or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Because
of the challenges to the CEA industry economy and the specific challenges of our business, we cannot predict the continuing level of
working capital that we will have in the future. As mentioned elsewhere, we have taken steps to conserve our cash resources by reducing
staff and taking other cost-cutting measures and we will continue to evaluate further such measures in the future. 

Summary
of Cash Flows 

The
following summarizes our approximate cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

Operating
Activities 

We
incurred a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 2,127,000 and have an accumulated deficit of 39,318,000 as of September
30, 2024. 

Cash
used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,213,000 compared to cash used in operating activities of 5,294,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3,081,000. 

32 

The
decrease in cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023, was primarily attributable to: (i) a decrease in cash used to fund working capital of 3,496,000, (ii) an increase in net loss
of 203,000, and (iii) a decrease in non-cash operating charges of 211,000. 

The
decrease in our working capital was primarily related to (i) a decrease in cash of 2,213,000, (ii) a decrease in inventory (net) of
 272,000, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 261,000, (iv) an increase in prepaid expenses
and other assets of 108,000, (v) an increase in accounts receivable of 53,000, and (v) a decrease in deferred revenue of 31,000. 

Investing
Activities 

There
were no cash flows from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided by investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was less than 1,000. 

Financing
Activities 

There
were no cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Inflation 

Our
operations are being influenced by the inflation in the larger economy and in the industries related to building renovations, retrofitting
and new build CEA facilities in which we operate. We believe that we will continue to face inflationary increases in the cost of products
and our operations, which will adversely affect our margins and financial results and the pricing of our service and product supply contracts.
Inflation is reflected in higher wages, increased pricing of equipment, delivery and transportation costs, and general operational expenses.
As we move forward, we plan to continuously monitor our various contract terms and may decide to add clauses that will permit us to adjust
pricing if inflation and price increase pressures on us will impact our ability to perform our contracts and maintain our margins. 

Contractual
Payment Obligations 

As
of September 30, 2024, our contractual payment obligations consisted of a building lease. Refer to Note 2 Leases 
of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included as part of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of our building
lease. 

Commitments
and Contingencies 

Refer
to Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included as part
of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of commitments and contingencies. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
are required to disclose any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,
or capital resources that are material to investors. As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet financing activities other than those included in the Contractual
Payment Obligations discussed above and those reflected in Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

33 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting
policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application
of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions
that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, management
uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are
based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, observance
of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.
Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Key estimates include: allocation of transaction prices to performance obligations
under contracts with customers, standalone selling prices, timing of expected revenue recognition on remaining performance obligations
under contracts with customers, valuation of intangible assets, valuation of equity-based compensation, valuation of deferred tax assets
and liabilities, warranty accruals, accounts receivable and inventory allowances, and legal contingencies. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, therefore are not required to provide the information
under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, both of which positions
are held by the same person, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that as a result of material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting as described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed
with the SEC, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

We
did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because: (i) we lack a sufficient complement
of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial
reporting requirements, (ii) there is inadequate segregation of duties due to our limited number of accounting personnel, and (iii) we
have insufficient controls and processes in place to adequately verify the accuracy and completeness of spreadsheets that we use for
a variety of purposes including revenue, taxes, stock-based compensation and other areas, and place significant reliance on, for our
financial reporting. 

We
intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies in the future when
our financial assets and our operations would support the requirements of additional personnel. We are committed to continuing to improve
our financial organization, when we are able, including, without limitation, expanding our accounting staff and improving our systems
and controls to reduce our reliance on the manual nature of our existing systems. However, due to our size and our financial resources,
remediating the several identified weaknesses has not been possible and may not be economically feasible now or in the future. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes identified in connection with our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30,
2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

On
October 20, 2023, Sweet Cut Grow, LLC and Green Ice, LLC (collectively, Claimant a client of the Company with which it
had an equipment contract and engineering contract, filed a demand for arbitration asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of
warranty, and unjust enrichment, and demand for 1,049,280 in damages, plus interest Claims ). The Company continues to
deny all the Claims and has asserted a counterclaim. The Company believes Claimant is owed nothing as the Company fulfilled all its obligations
under the contracts to Claimant, and further, that the negligence of a third-party supplier is the basis of the Claims. We intend to
generally defend the claims on the basis that we promptly addressed all problems, and that any issues with defective HVAC equipment are
the responsibility of our third-party equipment manufacturer. The Company s equipment contract with Claimant requires the parties
to arbitrate their disputes under the rules of the American Arbitration Association AAA ). The arbitration will be heard
in Denver, Colorado. The matter is in the preliminary phase. The parties will pay their own legal fees and expenses. The Company intends
to defend itself vigorously, believing there are no merits to the claims as currently presented. 

On
or about April 17, 2024, Optima Consulting Services, LLC (the Claimant ), a client of the Company with which it had an equipment
contract and engineering contract, advised the Company of a potential claim related to work performed by the Company for Claimant and
demanded mediation under the parties contract. On or about October 28, 2024, Claimant informed the Company it was asserting claims
for negligent/defective design and breach of warranty, and alleges its damages exceed 2,000,000 (Claims ). The Company denies
all the Claims and that Claimant is entitled to any damages. The Company believes Claimant is owed nothing as the Company fulfilled all
its obligations under the contracts to Claimant and performed all work in line with all applicable standards. We intend to generally
defend the Claims on the basis that all work was performed pursuant to the contract and any alleged issues that may have occurred were
the result of actions by Claimant and/or third parties. If Claimant moves forward with its Claims, the Company s equipment contract
with Claimant requires the parties to arbitrate their dispute with the American Arbitration Association AAA ). The arbitration
will be heard in Denver, Colorado. The matter is in the preliminary phase. The parties will pay their own legal fees and expenses. The
Company intends to defend itself vigorously, believing there are no merits to the Claims as currently presented. 

Given
the current uncertainty around estimating the likelihood of success of claims and potential damages, we have not recorded an accrual
for any potential loss related to these matters. 

From
time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the
enforcement of our rights under contracts with our customers. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In
addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should also carefully review and consider the risk factors contained in
our other reports and periodic filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the risk factors and uncertainties contained under
the caption Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors discussed in that Form
10-K do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not
known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None. 

Item
3. Defaults upon Senior Securities
