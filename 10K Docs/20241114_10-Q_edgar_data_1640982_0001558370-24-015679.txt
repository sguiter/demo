The primary geographic region in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities is North America.

The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants. The debt is secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or liability of the Company.

The Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Managing Member knows of no facts or circumstances that would make the Company s contractual commitments outside standard mutual covenants applicable to commercial transactions between businesses. Accordingly, the Company believes that these indemnification obligations are made in the ordinary course of business as part of standard commercial and industry practice, and that any potential liability under the Company s similar commitments is remote. Should any such indemnification obligation become payable, the Company would separately record and/or disclose such liability in accordance with GAAP. Units were issued and outstanding at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, inclusive of the Units issued to the initial Member (Managing Member). The Fund was authorized to issue up to Units in addition to the Units issued to the initial Member. The Company has the right, exercisable at the Managing Member s discretion, but not the obligation, to repurchase Units of a Unitholder who ceases to be a U.S. Citizen, for a price equal to of the holder s capital account. The Company is otherwise permitted, but not required, to repurchase Units upon a holder s request. The repurchase of Fund Units is made in accordance with Section 13 of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement. The repurchase would be at the discretion of the Managing Member on terms it determines to be appropriate under given circumstances, in the event that the Managing Member deems such repurchase to be in the best interest of the Company; provided, the Company is never required to repurchase any Units. Upon the repurchase of any Units by the Fund, the tendered Units are cancelled. Units repurchased in prior periods were repurchased at amounts representing the original investment less cumulative distributions made to the Unitholder with respect to the Units. All Units repurchased during a quarter are deemed to be repurchased effective the last day of the preceding quarter, and are not deemed to be outstanding during, or entitled to allocations of net income, net loss or distributions for the quarter in which such repurchase occurs. The Fund s net income or net losses are to be allocated to the members.

Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes. The Company determines the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance. Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Cash and cash equivalents The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments. Non-recourse debt The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arranagements. Commitments and Contingencies Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding. The fair value of contingent liabilities (or guarantees) is not considered material because management believes there has been no event that has occurred wherein a guarantee liability has been incurred or will likely be incurred.

Overview ATEL 17, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on April 16, 2015 for the purpose of raising capital and originating equipment financing transactions and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The offering of the Company was granted effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission as of January 5, 2016. The Company conducted a public offering of 15,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units Units ), at a price of 10 per Unit. The offering will continue until the earlier of a period of two years from that date or until sales of the limited liability company Units to the public reach 150 million. As of February 2, 2016, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing 1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow. On that date, the Company commenced initial operations. Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and will be released to the Fund only at such time as total subscription proceeds received by the Fund from all subscribers, including the escrowed Pennsylvania subscriptions, equal not less than 7.5 million in gross proceeds. Total contributions to the Fund exceeded 7.5 million on July 6, 2016. The offering was terminated on January 5, 2018. Results of Operations The three months ended September 30 , 2024 versus the three months ended September 30 , 2023 The Company had net losses of 62 thousand and 141 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Compared to the prior year quarter, the results for the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflect a decrease in total operating expenses and a favorable change in other gains and losses related to the fair valuation of the Fund s equity securities and warrants offset, in part, by a decline in total operating revenues. Revenues Total operating revenues decreased by 74 thousand, or 17 , mainly due to a 120 thousand decrease in operating lease revenues partially offset by a 46 thousand increase in gains realized on sales of lease assets. The decrease in operating lease revenues was mostly related to a 78 thousand decline in revenues from leases under month-to-month contracts. The remaining decline in operating lease revenues was mainly due to lease run-off and asset dispositions. Offsetting such decrease in revenues was a 46 thousand gain realized on sales of lease assets, mostly trucks and trailers, during the current period. There were no such sales during the prior year period. Expenses Total operating expenses decreased by 134 thousand, or 24 , primarily due to decreases in depreciation, professional fees and asset management fees. These were offset by increases in cost reimbursements to affiliates and outside services. 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 Deprecation expense decreased by 109 thousand mainly due to lease run-off and asset disposition since September 30, 2023. Professional fees decreased by 39 thousand due to a lower audit fees paid during the current quarter resulting from timing differences in receipt of services and billings, and asset management fees decreased by 16 thousand primarily due to the decline in managed assets and related revenue. Partially offsetting such decreases was a 16 thousand increase in cost reimbursements to affiliates, mainly due to allocated severance related payments, and a 16 thousand increase in outside services due to increased information technology-related charges. Other income/loss During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded other income totaling 6 thousand and other loss totaling 13 thousand, respectively, to reflect unrealized gains and losses on the fair valuation of the Fund s investment securities and warrants portfolio. Other income recorded during the current period all relates to unrealized gains on the Fund s warrant positions. In contrast, the prior year period other loss reflects an 8 thousand unrealized loss related to the Fund s equity securities and 5 thousand of unrealized losses related to its warrant positions, both due to adverse changes in prices of the underlying securities. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 The Company had net losses of 100 thousand and 370 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The results for the first nine months of 2024 reflect an increase in total operating revenues, a reduction in total operating expenses and a favorable change in other gains and losses related to the fair valuation of the Fund s equity securities and warrants. Revenues Total operating revenues for the first nine months of 2024 increased by 76 thousand, or 6 , when compared to the prior year period. Such increase was primarily due to a 221 thousand increase in gains on sale of lease assets, mostly lift trucks, during the period. There were no such sales during the prior year period. Such increase in revenues was partially offset by a 155 thousand decline in operating lease revenues, which was attributable to a 78 thousand decline in revenues from leases under month-to-month contracts, coupled with the impact of lease run-off and asset dispositions since September 30, 2023. Expenses Total operating expenses decreased by 173 thousand, or 10 , when compared to the prior year period. Such decrease was mainly a result of lower depreciation, asset management fees and interest expense offset, in part, by increases in professional fees, cost reimbursements to affiliates and outside sevices. Depreciation expense decreased by 172 thousand mainly due to lease run-off and dispositions since September 30, 2023. Asset management fees decreased by 19 thousand due to the continued decline of managed assets and related revenues, and interest expense decreased by 14 thousand due to the scheduled run-off of the Fund s borrowings under non-recourse debt. Partially offsetting such decreases was a 16 thousand increase in professional fees, which was attributable to higher legal fees paid during the current period resulting from timing differences in receipt of services and billings. In addition, costs reimbursed to the Manager increased by 11 thousand primarily due to allocated severance related payments; and outside services increased by 11 thousand mainly due to increased information technology-related charges. Other income/loss During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded other income totaling 4 thousand and other loss totaling 17 thousand, respectively, to reflect unrealized gains and losses on the fair valuation of the Fund s investment securities and warrants portfolio. Other income recorded during the current period all relates to unrealized gains on the Fund s warrant positions. By comparison, the prior year period other loss reflects a 10 thousand unrealized loss related to the Fund s equity securities and 7 thousand of unrealized losses related to its warrant positions, both due to adverse changes in prices of the underlying securities.

 Capital Resources and Liquidity At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled 217 thousand and 1 million, respectively. The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as leases and other assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales. The Company currently believes it has adequate reserves available to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves are found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements. The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes. Cash Flows The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 517 659 Investing activities 312 - Financing activities (1,612) (1,942) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (783) (1,283) During the respective nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s main source of liquidity was cash flows from its portfolio of operating lease contracts. During the current period, the Company also received 312 thousand of proceeds from sales of lease assets. There were no such proceeds during the prior year period. During the respective nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash was primarily used to pay distributions and repay borrowings under non-recourse debt. Cash used to pay distributions totaled 1.4 million and 1.5 million for the respective nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; and repayments of non-recourse debt totaled 251 thousand and 403 thousand for the respective nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cash was also used to pay invoices related to management fees and expenses, and other payables in both nine-month periods. Distributions The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement. The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of April 2016. Cash distributions were paid by the Fund to Unitholders of record as of August 31, 2024, and paid through September 30, 2024. The distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each. Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital. The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets; see the discussion in the Prospectus under Income, Losses and Distributions. Accordingly, the amount of cash flow from Fund investments distributed to Unitholders will not be available for reinvestment in additional portfolio assets. The cash distributions were based on current and anticipated gross revenues from the loans funded and equity investments acquired. During the Fund s acquisition and operating stages, the Fund may incur short term borrowing to fund regular distributions of such gross revenues to be generated by newly acquired transactions during their respective initial fixed terms. As such, all Fund periodic cash distributions made during these stages have been, and are expected in

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts, and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time. Actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
