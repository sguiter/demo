 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAUTIONARY STATEMENT This report contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry and certain assumptions made by us. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "may," "will," and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. The section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2023, and in Part II, Item 1A in this Form 10-Q, along with disclosures in our other Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC " filings discuss some of the important risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. You should carefully consider those risks, in addition to the other information in this report, and in our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our Company or to maintain or increase your investment. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by applicable law. The information contained in this Form 10-Q is not a complete description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in our common stock. We urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the SEC that discuss our business in greater detail and advise interested parties of certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our Company Texas Roadhouse, Inc. is a growing restaurant company operating predominantly in the casual dining segment. Our late founder, W. Kent Taylor, started the Company in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Clarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to three concepts with 772 restaurants in 49 states, one U.S. territory, and ten foreign countries. As of September 24, 2024, our 772 restaurants included: 657 company restaurants, of which 638 were wholly-owned and 19 were majority-owned. The results of operations of company restaurants are included in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. The portion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests in company restaurants that are majority-owned is reflected in the line item net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Of the 657 company restaurants, we operated 601 as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, 48 as Bubba s 33 restaurants, and eight as Jaggers restaurants. 115 franchise restaurants, of which 20 we have a 5.0 to 10.0 ownership interest. The income derived from our minority interests in these franchise restaurants is reported in the line item equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Of the 115 franchise restaurants, 56 were domestic Texas Roadhouse restaurants, three were domestic Jaggers restaurants, and 56 were international Texas Roadhouse restaurants, including one restaurant in a U.S. territory. We have contractual arrangements that grant us the right to acquire at pre-determined formulas the remaining equity interests in 17 of the 19 majority-owned company restaurants and 54 of the 59 systemwide domestic franchise restaurants. Throughout this report, we use the term "restaurants" to include Texas Roadhouse and Bubba s 33, unless otherwise noted.

 Presentation of Financial and Operating Data Throughout this report, the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024 and September 26, 2023, are referred to as Q3 2024 and Q3 2023, respectively. The 39 weeks ended September 24, 2024, and September 26, 2023, are referred to as 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, respectively. Fiscal year 2024 will be 53 weeks in length, with the fourth quarter 14 weeks in length. Fiscal year 2023 was 52 weeks in length, with the quarters 13 weeks in length. Key Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Company Key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following: Comparable Restaurant Sales. Comparable restaurant sales reflect the change in sales for all company restaurants across all concepts, unless otherwise noted, over the same period of the prior year for the comparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for a full 18 months before the beginning of the period measured excluding restaurants permanently closed during the period. Comparable restaurant sales can be impacted by changes in guest traffic counts or by changes in the per person average check amount. Menu price changes, the mix of menu items sold, and the mix of dine-in versus to-go sales can affect the per person average check amount. Average Unit Volume. Average unit volume represents the average quarterly, year-to-date, or annual restaurant sales for Texas Roadhouse and Bubba s 33 restaurants open for a full six months before the beginning of the period measured excluding sales of restaurants permanently closed during the period, if applicable. Historically, average unit volume growth is less than comparable restaurant sales growth which indicates that newer restaurants are operating with sales growth levels lower than the company average. At times, average unit volume growth may be more than comparable restaurant sales growth which indicates that newer restaurants are operating with sales growth levels higher than the company average. Store Weeks and New Restaurant Openings. Store weeks represent the number of weeks that all company restaurants across all concepts, unless otherwise noted, were open during the reporting period. Store weeks include weeks in which a restaurant is temporarily closed. Store week growth is driven by new restaurant openings and franchise acquisitions. New restaurant openings reflect the number of restaurants opened during a particular fiscal period, excluding store relocations. We consider store openings that occur simultaneously with a store closure in the same trade area to be a relocation. Restaurant Margin. Restaurant margin (in dollars, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, and per store week) represents restaurant and other sales less restaurant-level operating costs, including food and beverage costs, labor, rent, and other operating costs. Restaurant margin is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income from operations. This non-GAAP measure is not indicative of overall company performance and profitability in that this measure does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders due to the nature of the costs excluded. Restaurant margin is widely regarded as a useful metric by which to evaluate core restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis. In calculating restaurant margin, we exclude certain non-restaurant-level costs that support operations, but do not have a direct impact on restaurant-level operational efficiency and performance, including general and administrative expenses. We exclude pre-opening expenses as it occurs at irregular intervals and would impact comparability to prior period results. We exclude depreciation and amortization expenses, substantially all of which relates to restaurant-level assets, as it represents a non-cash charge for the investment in our restaurants. We exclude impairment and closure expenses as we believe this provides a clearer perspective of the Company s ongoing operating performance and a more useful comparison to prior period results. Restaurant margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry. A reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant margin is included in the Results of Operations section below.

 Other Key Definitions Restaurant and Other Sales. Restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales, net of promotions and discounts, for all company restaurants. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from restaurant sales in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Other sales include the net impact of the amortization of third party gift card fees and gift card breakage income, sales related to our non-royalty based retail products, and content revenue related to our tabletop kiosk devices. Franchise Royalties and Fees. Franchise royalties consist of royalties, as defined in our franchise agreement, paid to us by our domestic and international franchisees. Domestic and international franchisees also typically pay an initial franchise fee and/or development fee for each new restaurant or territory. Food and Beverage Costs. Food and beverage costs consist of the costs of raw materials and ingredients used in the preparation of food and beverage products sold in our company restaurants. Approximately half of our food and beverage costs relate to beef. Restaurant Labor Expenses. Restaurant labor expenses include all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations except for profit sharing incentive compensation expenses earned by our restaurant managing partners and market partners. These profit sharing expenses are reflected in restaurant other operating expenses. Restaurant labor expenses also include share-based compensation expense related to restaurant-level employees. Restaurant Rent Expense. Restaurant rent expense includes all rent, except pre-opening rent, associated with the leasing of real estate and includes base, percentage, and straight-line rent expense. Restaurant Other Operating Expenses. Restaurant other operating expenses consist of all other restaurant-level operating costs, the major components of which are credit card fees, profit sharing incentive compensation for our restaurant managing partners and market partners, utilities, supplies, general liability insurance, advertising, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and outside services. Pre-opening Expenses. Pre- opening expenses, which are charged to operations as incurred, consist of expenses incurred before the opening of a new or relocated restaurant and consist principally of opening and training team compensation and benefits, travel expenses, rent, food, beverage, and other initial supplies and expenses. The majority of pre-opening costs incurred relate to the hiring and training of employees due to the significant investment we make in training our people. Pre-opening costs vary by location depending on a number of factors, including the size and physical layout of each location; the number of management and hourly employees required to operate each restaurant; the availability of qualified restaurant staff members; the cost of travel and lodging for different geographic areas; the timing of the restaurant opening; and the extent of unexpected delays, if any, in obtaining final licenses and permits to open each restaurant. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles with definite lives, substantially all of which relates to restaurant-level assets. Impairment and Closure Costs, Net. Impairment and closure costs, net include any impairment of long- lived assets, including property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and goodwill, and expenses associated with the closure of a restaurant. Closure costs also include any gains or losses associated with a relocated restaurant or the sale of a closed restaurant and/or assets held for sale as well as costs associated with closed or relocated restaurants. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses comprise expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations and provide an infrastructure to support future growth. This includes salary, incentive-based and share-based compensation

 expense related to executive officers and Support Center employees, salary and share-based compensation expense related to market partners, software hosting fees, professional fees, group insurance, advertising expense, and the realized and unrealized holding gains and losses related to the investments in our deferred compensation plan. Interest Income, Net. Interest income, net includes earnings on cash and cash equivalents and is reduced by interest expense, net of capitalized interest, on our debt or financing obligations including the amortization of loan fees, as applicable. Equity Income from Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Equity income includes our percentage share of net income earned by unconsolidated affiliates and our share of any gain on the acquisition of these affiliates. As of September 24, 2024, and September 26, 2023, we owned a 5.0 to 10.0 equity interest in 20 domestic franchise restaurants. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the portion of income attributable to the other owners of the majority-owned restaurants. Our consolidated subsidiaries include 19 and 20 majority-owned restaurants as of September 24, 2024 and September 26, 2023, respectively. Q3 2024 Financial Highlights Total revenue increased 151.2 million or 13.5 to 1,273.0 million in Q3 2024 compared to 1,121.8 million in Q3 2023 primarily due to an increase in comparable restaurant sales and store weeks. Comparable restaurant sales and store weeks increased 8.5 and 5.8 , respectively, at company restaurants in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023. The increase in comparable restaurant sales was due to an increase in our per person average check along with an increase in guest traffic counts. The increase in store weeks was due to new store openings. Net income increased 20.6 million or 32.3 to 84.4 million in Q3 2024 compared to 63.8 million in Q3 2023 primarily due to higher restaurant margin dollars, as described below, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Diluted earnings per share increased 32.5 to 1.26 in Q3 2024 from 0.95 in Q3 2023 primarily due to the increase in net income. Restaurant margin dollars increased 39.2 million or 24.1 to 202.1 million in Q3 2024 compared to 162.8 million in Q3 2023 primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 16.0 in Q3 2024 compared to 14.6 in Q3 2023. The increase in restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, was primarily driven by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.7 and commodity inflation of 1.3 . In addition, during the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024, capital allocation spend included capital expenditures of 91.1 million, dividends of 40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of 9.6 million.

 Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 and 2024 YTD compared to 2023 YTD Restaurant and Other Sales Restaurant and other sales increased 13.5 in both Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 and 2024 YTD compared to 2023 YTD. The following table summarizes certain key drivers and/or attributes of restaurant sales at company restaurants for the periods presented. Company restaurant count activity is shown in the restaurant unit activity table above.

 The increases in restaurant sales for Q3 2024 and 2024 YTD were primarily attributable to an increase in store weeks and an increase in comparable restaurant sales. The increases in store weeks were driven by the opening of new restaurants. The increases in comparable restaurant sales were driven by an increase in our per person average check along with an increase in guest traffic counts as shown in the table below. 

Q3 2024 Q3 2023 2024 YTD 2023 YTD Guest traffic counts 3.8 4.1 4.3 5.5 Per person average check 4.7 4.1 4.5 4.6 Comparable restaurant sales growth 8.5 8.2 8.8 10.1 To-go sales as a percentage of restaurant sales were 12.7 in Q3 2024 compared to 12.3 in Q3 2023 and were 12.8 in 2024 YTD compared to 12.6 in 2023 YTD. Per person average check for 2024 includes the benefit of a menu price increase of approximately 2.2 implemented in Q2 2024 and menu price increases of approximately 2.2 and 2.7 implemented in Q2 2023 and Q4 2023, respectively. In addition, we implemented a menu price increase of approximately 0.9 in late September 2024. In 2024 YTD, we opened 19 Texas Roadhouse company restaurants and three Bubba s 33 company restaurants. In 2024, we expect store week growth of approximately 7.5 across all concepts, including a benefit of 2 from the 53 rd week. In 2025, we expect store week growth of approximately 5 across all concepts, including a benefit of 2 from the planned acquisition of 13 domestic franchise restaurants at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Other sales include the net impact of the amortization of third party gift card fees and gift card breakage income, sales related to our non-royalty based retail products, and content revenue related to our tabletop kiosk devices. The net impact of these amounts was (2.1) million in Q3 2024 and 1.4 million in Q3 2023 and was (11.3) million in 2024 YTD and (7.2) million in 2023 YTD. The changes in Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 were driven by favorable adjustments recorded of 0.6 million and 3.7 million, respectively. These adjustments related to changes in our estimate of gift card breakage due to a shift in our historic redemption patterns which indicated that the percentage of gift cards sold that are not expected to be redeemed had increased. Franchise Royalties and Fees Franchise royalties and fees increased by 1.2 million or 18.3 in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 and increased by 2.2 million or 11.1 in 2024 YTD compared with 2023 YTD. The increases were due to comparable franchise restaurant sales growth and new store openings partially offset by 0.2 million in Q3 2024 and 1.1 million in 2024 YTD related to the reclassification of certain items that were reported in general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income in Q3 2023 and 2023 YTD. In 2024 YTD, our franchise partners opened eight international Texas Roadhouse restaurants, including one in a U.S. territory, and one Jaggers domestic restaurant. Food and Beverage Costs Food and beverage costs, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, decreased to 33.5 in Q3 2024 compared to 34.6 in Q3 2023 and decreased to 33.4 in 2024 YTD compared to 34.8 in 2023 YTD. The decreases were primarily driven by the benefit of a higher average guest check partially offset by commodity inflation of 1.3 in Q3 2024 and 0.8 in 2024 YTD primarily due to higher beef costs. In 2024, we expect commodity inflation of less than 1 for the year with prices locked for approximately 70 of our remaining forecasted costs and the remainder subject to floating market prices. In 2025, we expect commodity inflation of 2 to 3 .

 Restaurant Labor Expenses Restaurant labor expenses, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, decreased to 33.8 in Q3 2024 compared to 34.0 in Q3 2023 and decreased to 33.0 in 2024 YTD compared to 33.5 in 2023 YTD. The decreases were primarily driven by the benefit of a higher average guest check and labor productivity partially offset by wage and other labor inflation of 4.7 in Q3 2024 and 4.5 in 2024 YTD. Wage and other labor inflation was driven by higher wage and benefit expense due to labor market pressures along with increases in state-mandated minimum and tipped wage rates and increased investment in our people. In 2024, we expect wage and other labor inflation of approximately 4.5 . In 2025, we anticipate our labor costs will continue to be pressured by wage and other labor inflation of 4 to 5 . Restaurant Rent Expense Restaurant rent expense, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, was 1.6 in both Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 and decreased to 1.5 in 2024 YTD compared to 1.6 in 2023 YTD. In Q3 2024, higher rent expense at our newer restaurants was offset by the increase in average unit volume. The decrease in 2024 YTD was driven by the increase in average unit volume partially offset by higher rent expense at our newer restaurants. Restaurant Other Operating Expenses Restaurant other operating expenses, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, decreased to 15.1 in Q3 2024 compared to 15.2 in Q3 2023 and increased to 14.9 in 2024 YTD compared to 14.7 in 2023 YTD. The decrease in Q3 2024 was driven by the increase in average unit volume partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. The increase in 2024 YTD was driven by an increase in general liability insurance expense of 2.4 million and higher incentive compensation expense partially offset by the increase in average unit volume. The increase in general liability insurance expense was due to unfavorable claims experience and an increase in retention levels. Pre-opening Expenses Pre-opening expenses were 7.3 million in Q3 2024 compared to 8.7 million in Q3 2023 and 21.6 million in 2024 YTD compared to 19.7 million in 2023 YTD. Pre-opening costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on specific pre-opening costs incurred for each restaurant, the number and timing of restaurant openings, and the number and timing of restaurant managers hired. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of total revenue, was 3.5 in both Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 and was 3.3 in both 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD. In both periods, higher depreciation expense at our newer restaurants was offset by the increase in average unit volume. Impairment and Closure Costs, Net Impairment and closure costs, net were 0.8 million in Q3 2024 and were not significant in Q3 2023 and were 1.1 million in 2024 YTD compared to 0.1 million in 2023 YTD. In Q3 2024 and 2024 YTD, impairment and closure costs, net included costs related to the impairment of a building at a previously relocated store. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, were 4.3 in both Q3 2024 and Q3 2023 and decreased to 4.2 in 2024 YTD compared to 4.3 in 2023 YTD. In Q3 2024, higher restricted stock expense and incentive compensation expense were offset by an increase in average unit volume. The decrease in 2024 YTD was driven by the increase in average unit volume and a separation payout of 2.6 million in Q1 2023, related to the retirement of an executive officer, partially offset by higher restricted stock expense and incentive compensation

 expense. The increases in restricted stock expense were primarily due to shifting our restricted stock grants from quarterly to annually. Interest Income, Net Interest income, net was 1.9 million and 0.5 million in Q3 2024 and Q3 2023, respectively, and was 5.0 million and 2.7 million in 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, respectively. The increases were driven by increased earnings on our cash and cash equivalents in both periods and decreased borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2024 YTD. Equity Income from Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity income was 0.2 million in Q3 2024 compared to 0.1 million Q3 2023 and was 0.8 million in 2024 YTD compared to 1.2 million in 2023 YTD. The increase in Q3 2024 was driven by increased earnings on these affiliates. The decrease in 2024 YTD was primarily driven by a 0.6 million gain on the acquisition of four of these affiliates in 2023 YTD partially offset by increased earnings on these remaining affiliates. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate was 16.7 in Q3 2024 compared to 11.9 in Q3 2023 and was 15.1 in 2024 YTD compared to 12.9 in 2023 YTD. The increases were driven by a decrease in the impact of the FICA tip tax credit, which was driven by increased profitability. In 2024, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 15 based on forecasted operating results. In 2025, we expect an effective tax rate of 15 to 16 based on forecasted operating results. Segment Information We manage our restaurant and franchising operations by concept and as a result have identified Texas Roadhouse, Bubba's 33, Jaggers, and our retail initiatives as separate operating segments. Our reportable segments are Texas Roadhouse and Bubba's 33. The Texas Roadhouse reportable segment includes the results of our domestic company Texas Roadhouse restaurants and domestic and international franchise Texas Roadhouse restaurants. The Bubba's 33 reportable segment includes the results of our domestic company Bubba's 33 restaurants. Our remaining operating segments, which include the results of our domestic company and franchise Jaggers restaurants and the results of our retail initiatives, are included in Other. In addition, corporate-related assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures are also included in Other. Management uses restaurant margin as the primary measure for assessing performance of our segments. Restaurant margin (in dollars and as a percentage of restaurant and other sales) represents restaurant and other sales less restaurant-level operating costs, including food and beverage costs, labor, rent, and other operating costs. Restaurant margin also includes sales and operating costs related to our non-royalty based retail initiatives that are included in Other. Restaurant margin is used by our CODM to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance. A reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant margin is included in the Results of Operations section above.

The increases were primarily due to higher sales and improved labor productivity partially offset by wage and other labor inflation as well as higher general liability insurance expense in the 2024 YTD period. In our Bubba s 33 reportable segment , restaurant margin dollars increased 3.0 million or 39.9 in Q3 2024 and increased 9.6 million or 37.7 in 2024 YTD. The increases were primarily due to higher sales and improved labor productivity partially offset by wage and other labor inflation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents a summary of our net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands): 

39 Weeks Ended September 24, 2024 September 26, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 516,089 390,739 Net cash used in investing activities (237,216) (273,519) Net cash used in financing activities (193,914) (221,757) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 84,959 (104,537) Net cash provided by operating activities was 516.1 million in 2024 YTD compared to 390.7 million in 2023 YTD. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net income and a favorable change in working capital. Our operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we have been able to operate with negative working capital, if necessary. Sales are primarily for cash, and restaurant operations do not require significant inventories or receivables. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages, and supplies, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. Net cash used in investing activities was 237.2 million in 2024 YTD compared to 273.5 million in 2023 YTD. The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of eight domestic franchise restaurants for 39.1 million in Q1 2023. We require capital principally for the development of new company restaurants, the refurbishment or relocation of existing restaurants and the acquisition of franchise restaurants, as applicable. We either lease our restaurant site locations under operating leases for periods of five to 30 years (including renewal periods) or purchase the land when appropriate. As of September 24, 2024, we had developed 153 of the 657 company restaurants on land that we own.

 The following table presents a summary of capital expenditures (in thousands): 

39 Weeks Ended September 24, 2024 September 26, 2023 New company restaurants 144,574 138,124 Refurbishment or expansion of existing restaurants 87,014 88,580 Relocation of existing restaurants 10,540 11,946 Capital expenditures related to Support Center office 4,411 5,245 Total capital expenditures 246,539 243,895 Our future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number and mix of new restaurants we open, the timing of those openings, and the restaurant prototype developed in a given fiscal year. These requirements will include costs directly related to opening, maintaining, or relocating restaurants and may also include costs necessary to ensure that our infrastructure is able to support a larger restaurant base. We intend to satisfy our capital requirements over the next 12 months with cash on hand, net cash provided by operating activities and, if needed, funds available under our revolving credit facility. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of 360 million to 370 million. In 2025, we expect capital expenditures of approximately 400 million. Net cash used in financing activities was 193.9 million in 2024 YTD compared to 221.8 million in 2023 YTD. The decrease is primarily due to the 50 million repayment of our revolving credit facility in 2023 YTD partially offset by an increase in our quarterly dividend payment. On February 14, 2024, our Board authorized the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of 0.61 per share of common stock compared to the quarterly dividend of 0.55 per share of common stock declared in 2023. The payment of quarterly dividends totaled 122.2 million and 110.4 million in 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, respectively. On March 17, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 300.0 million of our common stock. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. All repurchases to date under our stock repurchase programs have been made through open market transactions. During 2024 YTD and 2023 YTD, we paid 44.7 million and 45.2 million, respectively, to repurchase 278,914 shares and 414,319 shares, respectively, of our common stock. As of September 24, 2024, 72.2 million remained under our authorized stock repurchase program. We maintain a credit facility with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank, N.A. The credit facility is an unsecured, revolving credit agreement and has a borrowing capacity of up to 300.0 million with the option to increase by an additional 200.0 million subject to certain limitations, including approval by the syndicate of commercial lenders. The credit facility has a maturity date of May 1, 2026. As of September 24, 2024 and December 26, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and had 295.3 million of availability, net of 4.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, respectively. The interest rate for the credit facility as of September 24, 2024 and September 26, 2023 was 5.72 and 6.19 , respectively. The lenders obligation to extend credit pursuant to the credit facility depends on us maintaining certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness, except for the incurrence of secured indebtedness that in the aggregate is equal to or greater than 125.0 million and 20 of our consolidated tangible net worth. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 24, 2024.

 Guarantees As of September 24, 2024 and December 26, 2023, we were contingently liable for 9.7 million and 10.4 million, respectively, for seven lease guarantees. These amounts represent the maximum potential liability of future payments under the guarantees. In the event of default, the indemnity and default clauses in our assignment agreements govern our ability to pursue and recover damages incurred. No material liabilities have been recorded as of September 24, 2024 and December 26, 2023 as the likelihood of default was deemed to be less than probable and the fair value of the guarantees is not considered significant. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RIS K We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and changes in commodity prices. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt. The terms of the credit facility require us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at SOFR, plus a fixed adjustment of 0.10 , plus a variable adjustment of 0.875 to 1.875 depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 24, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. In an effort to secure high quality, low-cost ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants, we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques. When purchasing certain types of commodities, we may be subject to prevailing market conditions resulting in unpredicta ble price volatility. For certain commodities, we may also enter into contracts for terms of one year or less that are either fixed price agreements or fixed volume agreements where the price is negotiated with reference to fluctuating market prices. We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness. Extreme and/or long-term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results, especially if we are unable, primarily due to competitive reasons, to increase menu prices. Additionally, if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases, our short-term financial results could be negatively affected. We are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon four vendors. If these vendors are unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts, we may encounter supply shortages and/or higher costs to secure adequate supply and a possible loss of sales, any of which would harm our business. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to, and as defined in, Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO"), our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 24, 2024. Changes in Internal Control There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

LEGAL PROCEEDING S Occasionally, we are a defendant in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business, including "slip and fall" accidents, employment related claims, claims related to our service of alcohol, and claims from guests or employees alleging illness, injury or food quality, health or operational concerns. None of these types of litigation, most of which are covered by insurance at varying retention levels, has had a material adverse effect on us during the periods covered by this report and, as of the date of this report, we are not party to any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business.

On March 17, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program which authorized us to repurchase up to 300.0 million of our common stock. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. All repurchases to date under our stock repurchase programs have been made through open market transactions. The timing and the amount of any repurchases through this program will be determined by management under parameters established by the Board, based on an evaluation of our stock price, market conditions and other corporate considerations, including complying with Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements under the Exchange Act. For the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024, we paid 9.6 million to repurchase 56,248 shares of our common stock. As of September 24, 2024, 72.2 million remained authorized for stock repurchases.
