 Identifiable Intangible assets recognized in conjunction with acquisitions are recorded at fair value. Significant unobservable inputs are used to determine the fair value of the identifiable Intangible assets based on the income approach valuation model whereby the present worth and anticipated future benefits of the identifiable Intangible assets are discounted back to their net present value.

Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred. 
 
 The Company evaluates the recoverability of Intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an Intangible asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions and its impact on each of the reporting units. The Company annually evaluates the remaining useful lives of all Intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. In Fiscal 2023, management decided to eliminate the use of various trade names and go to market under the BGSF brand. Management's rebranding created an impairment of million.

Although both fiscal periods consisted of a federal benefit at statutory rates, Fiscal 2024 had a lower state expense and a temporary book to tax difference for equity related items. 
 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts are classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryovers. The overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period. Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected as adjustments to tax expense in the period of enactment. As of September 29, 2024, the Company has a million net operating loss carry forward from the 2020 EdgeRock acquisition with no expiration date. These net operating losses are subject to an annual Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation of million. 
 
 When appropriate, the Company will record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Comparative segment revenues and related financial information are discussed herein and are presented in Note 14 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. See Forward Looking Statements on page 3 of this report and Risk Factors included in our filings with the SEC, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for a description of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected results. 
 
 Our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We provide consulting, managed services, and professional workforce solutions to a variety of industries through our various divisions in information technology IT , Finance Accounting, Managed Solutions, and Property Management (apartment communities and commercial buildings). 
 
 On May 8, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors has initiated a process to evaluate potential strategic alternatives and engaged financial advisors in an endeavor to maximize shareholder value Strategic alternatives review ). 
 
 We currently operate primarily within the United States of America in our Property Management and Professional segments. 
 
 Our Property Management segment provides office and maintenance field talent in 39 states and D.C., to property management companies responsible for the apartment communities' and commercial buildings' day-to-day operations. 
 
 Our Professional segment provides specialized talent and business consultants for IT, managed services, finance, accounting, legal, and human resources. The segment operates across the U.S. in three divisions, IT, Managed Solutions, and Finance Accounting, with the IT division providing additional nearshore and offshore solutions in Colombia and India. 
 
 Our business normally experiences seasonal fluctuations. Our quarterly operating results are affected by the number of billing days in a quarter, as well as the seasonality of our client partners business. Demand for our Property Management workforce solutions typically increase in the second quarter and is highest during the third quarter of the year due to the increased turns in multifamily units during the summer months when schools are not in session. Overall first quarter demand can be affected by adverse weather conditions in the winter months. In addition, our cost of services typically increases in the first quarter primarily due to the reset of payroll taxes.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA (defined below), a measure that is not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America non-GAAP ), in this Quarterly Report to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP can provide alone. Our board and management also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain compensation programs and plans for our management. In addition, the financial covenants in our credit agreement are based on EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment losses, costs associated with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives Strategic alternatives review ), transaction fees, and certain non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation expense. Omitting interest, taxes, and the other items provides a financial measure that facilitates comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness and tax structures that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of property and intangible assets. We also believe that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate Adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of 

our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income from operations for the periods indicated as a measure of our performance. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 
 The use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as an alternative to, GAAP measures such as net (loss) income. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity under GAAP or otherwise, and is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from that term or by unusual or non-recurring items. The limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include: (i) it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) it does not reflect income tax payments we may be required to make; and (iv) it does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments associated with indebtedness. 
 
 To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA from net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, set forth in the following table. All of the items included in the reconciliation from net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items or (ii) items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance. In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance. In the case of the other items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance, management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact may not reflect ongoing operating performance.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by field talent payments, tax payments and client partner accounts receivable receipts. Since receipts from client partners lag payments to field talent, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our first amendment under our amended and restated credit agreement with BMO, that provides for a revolving credit facility maturing December 31, 2026 (the Revolving Facility ). Our primary uses of cash are payments to field talent, team members, related payroll liabilities, operating expenses, capital expenditures, cash interest, cash taxes, contingent consideration, and debt payments. We believe that the cash generated from operations, together with the borrowing availability under our Revolving Facility, will be sufficient to meet our normal working capital needs for at least the next twelve months, including investments made, and expenses incurred, in connection with opening new markets throughout the next year. Our ability to continue to fund these items may be affected 

by general economic, competitive and other factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to obtain additional debt or equity capital or refinance all or a portion of our debt. 
 
 While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and expansion plans, we may elect to pursue additional growth opportunities within the next year that could require additional debt or equity financing. If we are unable to secure additional financing at favorable terms in order to pursue such additional growth opportunities, our ability to pursue such opportunities could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 A summary of our working capital, operating, investing and financing activities are shown in the following table: 
 September 29, 2024 December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Working capital 22,037 (18,144) Thirty-nine Weeks Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operations: Operating activities 21,246 15,094 Investing activities (1,370) (8,759) Financing activities (19,614) (6,335) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 262 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities consists of net (loss) income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, interest expense, provision for credit losses, impairment losses, and the effect of working capital changes. The primary drivers of cash inflows and outflows are accounts receivable, accrued payroll and expenses, and other current assets. 
 
 During Fiscal 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 21.2 million, an increase of 6.2 million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 15.1 million for Fiscal 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased payments on accounts receivable, decreased payments on accrued payroll and expenses, and within other current assets there were payments made in 2024 related to the 2023 Arroyo Consulting acquisition which were partially offset by payments received in 2023 related to sale of the Light Industrial segment. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for businesses acquired and capital expenditures. 
 
 In Fiscal 2024, we made capital expenditures of 1.4 million primarily related to continued IT improvements. In Fiscal 2023, we paid 6.8 million for the acquisition of Arroyo Consulting and we made capital expenditures of 2.0 million mainly related to the continued IT improvements. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities consisted principally of borrowings and payments under our credit agreement and payment of dividends. 
 
 For Fiscal 2024, we reduced our Revolving Facility 17.2 million, we made a payment of 4.3 million of contingent consideration related to the Arroyo Consulting Acquisition, we disbursed 1.6 million in cash dividends on our common stock, and we paid down 0.9 million on the Term Loan. For Fiscal 2023, we disbursed 4.9 million in cash dividends on our common stock, we paid down 5.0 million on the Term Loan, we made payments of 1.1 million of contingent consideration related to the Momentum acquisition, and borrowed 4.3 million on our Revolving Facility for increased operating needs. 

Credit Agreements 
 
 On July 16, 2019, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), which would have matured on July 16, 2024, led by BMO, as lead administrative agent, lender, letters of credit issuer, and swing line lender. We entered into four amendments from August 18, 2022 through May 19, 2023, which changed the interest rate component from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), exercised the option to borrow 40.0 million, required 2.5 of the original principal balance of the new term loan, permitted a foreign entity acquisition, modified the distributions terms, and increased a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") by 6.0 million. 
 
 On March 12, 2024, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated through our entry into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which would have matured on March 12, 2028, led by BMO as administrative agent, letter of credit issuer, and swing line lender (the Restated Agreement ). The Restated Agreement provided for a Revolving Facility which permitted us to borrow funds in an aggregate amount up to 40 million. The Restated Agreement also provided for a term loan commitment, which permitted us to borrow funds from time to time (the Term Loan ). In July 2024, we exercised the option to borrow on a delayed draw term loan of 4.3 million related to payments on the Arroyo Consulting Acquisition's working capital true up , hold backs, and year one contingent consideration. 
 
 On November 6, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, maturing December 31, 2026, led by BMO as administrative agent, letter of credit issuer, and swing line lender (the First Credit Amendment ). The availability on the Revolving Facility, which permits us to borrow funds from time to time, was reduced in an aggregate amount up to 20 million. We are required to repay the Term Loan in quarterly principal installments equal to 2.5 of the aggregate principal balance. The First Credit Amendment provides for interest either at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, or the Adjusted Term SOFR plus the Applicable Margin (as defined in the First Credit Amendment). Our obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all our tangible and intangible property. The First Credit Amendment provides for an amended financial covenants with a maximum Leverage Ratio, a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, and a minimum EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the First Credit Amendment). We will pay an unused commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of Revolving Facility. We were in compliance with the affirmative and negative covenants as of September 29, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Letter of Credit 
 
 In March 2020, in conjunction with the EdgeRock acquisition, we entered into a standby letter of credit arrangement, which expires February 12, 2028, for purposes of protecting a lessor against default on lease payments. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a maximum financial exposure from this standby letter of credit totaling 0.1 million, all of which is considered usage against our Revolving Facility. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements. Please also refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a more detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies. 
 
 As a result of the economic uncertainty, we may need to make necessary changes to accounting policy judgments and estimates over time, which could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods. Actual results and outcomes may differ from our estimates and assumptions. 

The current inflationary environment and related interest rate impacts continue to have significant adverse impact on the economy and market conditions. These factors may impact labor markets by reducing demand for our workforce solutions, increase early terminations, or diminish projects. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected, and could increase our cost of borrowing. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 We derive our revenues from operations in our Property Management and Professional segments. We provide workforce solutions, placement services, and managed services. Revenues are recognized when promised workforce solutions are delivered to client partners, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. We recognize revenue through the following types of services: workforce solutions, contingent placements, retained search placements, and managed services. 
 
 Intangible Assets 
 
 We hold intangible assets with indefinite and finite lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives, ranging from three to ten years, based on a pattern in which the economic benefit of the respective intangible asset is realized. We capitalize purchased software and internal payroll costs directly incurred in the modification of software for internal use. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill represents the difference between the enterprise value or consideration exchanged less the fair value of all recognized net asset fair values including identifiable intangible asset values in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The current provision for income taxes represents estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed or to be filed for the year. We recognizes any penalties when necessary as part of selling, general and administrative expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts are classified net as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryovers. When appropriate, we will record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. We follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their potential effect on our results of operations and financial condition, refer to Note 2 in the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to certain market risks from transactions we enter into in the normal course of business. Our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate and inflation risks. Through the current period, we have been able to moderate the negative impacts of an inflationary market by adjusting our pricing model. 
 
 Interest Rates 
 
 Our Revolving Facility and Term Loan are priced at a variable interest rates. Accordingly, future interest rate increases could potentially put us at risk for an adverse impact on future earnings and cash flows. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at a reasonable assurance level, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 For the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluations required by Rule 13a-15(d) or Rule 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of our team members are working remotely. We are continually monitoring and assessing the impact of the ongoing situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our CEO and our CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

 No change from the information provided in ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In evaluating us and our common stock, we urge you to carefully consider the risks and other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (our 2023 Form 10-K ), and filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, and in our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed subsequently with the SEC. Any of the risks discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and any of the risks disclosed in Item 1A. of Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K or in our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed subsequently with the SEC, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

Our strategic alternatives review process may not be successful, may be costly, time-consuming, and complex, and may not yield the desired results 
 
 On May 8, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had initiated a process to evaluate potential strategic alternatives and had engaged Houlihan Lokey as its financial advisors. We have not set a timetable for completion of this strategic alternatives review process, and our Board of Directors has not approved a definitive course of action. There can be no assurance that this strategic alternatives review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms, or at all. Any potential transaction would be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties, and stockholder support. The process of evaluating strategic alternatives may be costly, time-consuming, and complex. Speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to the future of the Company could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or otherwise materially impact our stockholder, employee, customer, supplier, and other business relationships. Even if we successfully consummate a transaction from our review of strategic alternatives, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of any transaction, those benefits may take longer to realize than expected, or we may encounter integration or other difficulties.

If Borrower fails to so reimburse L C Issuer by such time, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the delivery of a Revolving Credit Borrowing Request).

In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender s payment to Administrative Agent for the account of L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Revolving Credit Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.2. 
 1.1.18.4. Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) to reimburse L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Credit Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of L C Issuer.

 1.1.18.6. If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3(c) by the time specified in Section 2.3(c)(ii) , then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, L C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by L C Issuer in accordance with banking

 1.1.19.2. If any payment received by Administrative Agent for the account of L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 12.24 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by L C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of L C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Credit Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.

Day. Any such extension of time for payment shall be included in computing interest which has accrued and shall be payable in connection with such payment.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Credit Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Borrowing. If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan.

 Signature Page to 
 First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 

the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.

For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 12.1(b) without regard to the existence of any participation. 
 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 12.10 which requires the consent of all Lenders and affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.5 and 3.4 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.4(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.4(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 3.6 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.1 or 3.4 , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to 
 Signature Page to 
 First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 

receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.6 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.2 as though it were a Lender provided that such Participant agrees to pay to Administrative Agent any amount set-off for application to the Obligations under the Loan Documents as required pursuant to Section 4.2 provided, further that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 12.23 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a Participant Register provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 1.1.145. Certain Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
 1.1.146. Dissemination of Information . Borrower and each other Obligated Party authorizes Administrative Agent and each Lender to disclose to any actual or prospective purchaser, assignee or other recipient of a Lender s Commitment, any and all information in Administrative Agent s or such Lender s possession concerning Borrower, the other Obligated Parties and their respective Affiliates. 
 Section 12.9 Survival . All representations and warranties made in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any document, statement, or certificate furnished in connection with this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and no investigation by Administrative Agent or any Lender or any closing shall affect the representations and warranties or the right of Administrative Agent or any Lender to rely upon them. Without prejudice to the survival of any other obligation of Borrower hereunder, the obligations of Borrower under Sections 12.1 and 12.2 shall survive repayment of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments. 
 Section 12.10 Amendment . The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party may be amended or waived only by an instrument in writing signed by Required Lenders (or by Administrative Agent with the consent of Required

 Signature Page to 
 First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 

of any voluntary prepayment by Borrower of any Note and or the Related Indebtedness, then it is Borrower s, Administrative Agent s and Lenders express intent that all amounts charged in excess of the Maximum Rate shall be automatically canceled, ab initio, and all amounts in excess of the Maximum Rate theretofore collected by Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be credited on the principal balance of any Note and or the Related Indebtedness (or, if any Note and all Related Indebtedness have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the provisions of any Note and the other Loan Documents shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder provided , however , if any Note or Related Indebtedness has been paid in full before the end of the stated term thereof, then Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, shall, with reasonable promptness after Administrative Agent or such Lender discovers or is advised by Borrower that interest was received in an amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, either refund such excess interest to Borrower and or credit such excess interest against such Note and or any Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrower to Administrative Agent or such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees that as a condition precedent to any claim seeking usury penalties against Administrative Agent or such Lender, Borrower will provide written notice to Administrative Agent or any Lender, advising Administrative Agent or such Lender in reasonable detail of the nature and amount of the violation, and Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice in which to correct such usury violation, if any, by either refunding such excess interest to Borrower or crediting such excess interest against the Note to which the alleged violation relates and or the Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrower to Administrative Agent or such Lender. All sums contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by Administrative Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of any debt evidenced by any Note and or the Related Indebtedness shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized or spread, using the actuarial method, throughout the stated term of such Note and or the Related Indebtedness (including any and all renewal and extension periods) until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Note and or the Related Indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate from time to time in effect and applicable to such Note and or the Related Indebtedness for so long as debt is outstanding. In no event shall the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts and revolving triparty accounts) apply to the Notes and or any of the Related Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Administrative Agent or any Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration. 
 Section 12.20 Ceiling Election . To the extent that any Lender is relying on Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code to determine the Maximum Rate payable on any Note and or any other portion of the Obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender will utilize the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect as provided in such Chapter 303. To the extent United States federal law permits any Lender to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest than under Texas law, such Lender will rely on United States federal law instead of

 First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 

such Chapter 303 for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate. Additionally, to the extent permitted by applicable law now or hereafter in effect, any Lender may, at its option and from time to time, utilize any other method of establishing the Maximum Rate under such Chapter 303 or under other applicable law by giving notice, if required, to Borrower as provided by applicable law now or hereafter in effect.

 Revenues were 71.2 million for Q3, compared to 68.1 million for Q2. 
 Property Management segment revenues increased 15.9 from Q2, driven by seasonal demand. 
 Professional segment revenues declined 2.5 from Q2, due to a decline in billed hours in the Finance Accounting division. 
 Gross profit was 24.3 million, up from 23.6 million in Q2, primarily due to higher sales in Property Management. 
 Net loss was 0.8 million, or 0.07 per diluted share for Q3 and Q2. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 1 was 3.2 million (4.5 of revenues) in Q3 from 2.6 million (3.8 of revenues) in Q2.

 1 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures as defined and reconciled below. 

Beth A. Garvey, Chair, President, and CEO, said, Although economic uncertainties persist and the demand environment remains choppy for the entire IT consulting and workforce industry, we are pleased to report that our third quarter total revenues improved sequentially by 4.5 . This sales progression was due to a seasonal lift in Property Management, up 15.9 , compared to the second quarter. In addition, the Professional segment stabilized late in the quarter, down 2.5 for the quarter compared to the second quarter. We continue to launch 2024 project wins expeditiously, including the major IT transformation project related to a large international client that we discussed last quarter. Our largest category in Professional, IT consulting, maintained stable topline revenues between second and third quarters, which is positive. Finance Accounting experienced lower project work in the third quarter due to typical seasonality for calendar reporting clients. Permanent placements stabilized with flat revenues between second and third quarters. Conversely, Managed Solutions continued to grow sequentially, which aligns with our strategic goals of expanding our consulting efforts. We remain cautiously optimistic at the pockets of revenue categories that stabilized this quarter but continue to tightly manage costs and expenses. 
 
 As part of our ongoing technology enhancements, I am pleased to share that we have launched our advanced lead generation engine in the third quarter, made possible by our earlier investment to modernize our tech stack. BGSF s technology platform leverages our marketing automation to streamline better lead acquisition and increase conversion rates across both our Professional and Property Management divisions. We have other tech enhancements launching in the fourth quarter to drive better efficiencies and believe these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to BGSF s digital transformation to improve client engagement and deliver cutting-edge workforce solutions. 
 
 The review of strategic alternatives work continues, and we have no updates that we can share today. We look forward to discussing in more detail in the future, concluded Garvey.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 The financial results of BGSF, Inc. are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. To help the readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS. 
 
 A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income per diluted share, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or measures of our liquidity. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are useful performance measures and are used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. In addition, the financial covenants in our credit agreement are based on EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA" as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, costs associated with the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives Strategic alternatives review ), transaction fees, and certain non-cash expenses such as impairment losses and share-based compensation expense, as well as certain specific events that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance. 
 
 We define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share eliminating amortization expense of intangible assets from acquisitions, the Strategic Alternatives Review, transaction fees, and certain non-cash expenses such as impairment losses, as well as certain specific events that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance, net of the respective income tax effect.
