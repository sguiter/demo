 On August 1, 2024, we undertook a corporate reorganization, the result of which was that all of the assets and business operations of the Company are now held by System1 Holdings, LLC ("System1 Holdings"), a newly formed intermediate holding company of which we maintain the controlling interest and in which the non-controlling interest is owned by the holders of our Class C common stock. Following the corporate reorganization, (a) System1 Holdings now owns of S1 Holdco, LLC ("S1 Holdco"), the previous intermediate holding company with the non-controlling interest, and of S1 Media, LLC ("S1 Media"), another new subsidiary formed in connection with the corporate reorganization, (b) S1 Media holds the assets and business operations associated with our owned and operated products, which includes CouponFollow, Startpage and Mapquest, and (c) S1 Holdco holds our remaining assets and business operations associated with our digital advertising businesses, including our proprietary RAMP platform. S1 Holdco and its subsidiaries remain obligors and guarantors under our Term Loan and 2022 Revolving Facility, and System1 Holdings and S1 Media are not parties thereto.

In our opinion, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair statement of our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 or future operating periods.

million as of September 30, 2023, and salaries and benefits expense was understated by an immaterial amount for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and overstated by million f or the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of not accelerating expenses upon the forfeiture of certain cash and equity Replacement Awards (as defined in Note 9, Net Loss Per Share previously granted in 2022. This impacted the condensed consolidated balance sheet, condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity, and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 
 b. We did not appropriately account for changes in equity and earnings per share, specifically: 
 i. the carrying amount of non-controlling interest was not updated as changes in ownership events occurred during each reporting period; 
 ii. certain equity Replacement Awards granted during 2022 were not properly considered in the allocation of net income (loss) to controlling and non-controlling interest and earnings per share. These errors impacted the condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statement of operations, condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity, and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 
 c. We made additional corrections for other immaterial errors. 
 
 d. We adjusted for the tax impacts of the revisions related to such errors described above. 
 
 We concluded that the errors were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to our previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements for the impacted period. To correct the immaterial errors, we have revised our previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 We have revised the condensed consolidated balance sheet, condensed consolidated statement of operations, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss), condensed consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity, and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended September 30, 2023 , as well as the associated Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements to reflect the correction of these immaterial errors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 .

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal tax rate of 21 to the loss before income taxes due to the exclusion of non-controlling loss, state taxes, foreign rate differential, non-deductible expenses, changes to tax reserves, return to provision true-ups, increase to the valuation allowance related to unrealizable deferred tax assets, and outside basis adjustments. As of September 30, 2024 , we had a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would not be realized. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , inclusive of interest, payments were made to the parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The total amount of Tax Receivable Agreement Payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had various non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space which have been recorded as Operating lease liabilities. 
 
 Litigation 
 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We believe the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these actions will not materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance, however, that the ultimate resolution of such actions will not materially or adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We accrued for losses when the loss is deemed probable and the liability can reasonably be estimated. 
 
 In October 2023, a putative California class action complaint (the "Complaint") was filed against us and our Protected business regarding alleged violations of California s Auto Renewal Law requirements related to the marketing and sale of its subscription service offerings for anti-virus and ad-blocking software (the "Protected Software") to consumers. The Complaint alleges claims under California s false advertising and unfair competition laws and primarily alleges that the marketing and sales checkout flows for the Protected Software did not clearly and conspicuously disclose that the named plaintiffs set forth in the Complaint were purchasing the Protected Software for a promotional period which would auto-renew after the applicable promotional period. While we dispute the claims alleged, we reached a tentative settlement during June 2024. During September 2024 we entered into a Settlement Agreement, that still remains subject to court approval. The amount of such settlement has been accrued accordingly in a ccrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Indemnifications 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, investors, directors, officers, employees, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnifications may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to claims related to these indemnifications. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements was immaterial. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2024 .

 For the periods presented in the table above, a total of million Public Warrants were excluded from the computation of net loss per share as the impact was anti-dilutive. In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we excluded stock appreciation rights ("SARs") of million as they are contingently issuable based on certain performance conditions, which were not achieved as of September 30, 2024 .

 During 2022, we replaced certain unvested profits interests awards, value creation units and Class F units that were outstanding, with a combination of a restricted stock unit and cash awards (collectively, "Replacement Awards"). We do not consider unvested Class A common stock related to the Replacement Awards as outstanding for accounting purposes as they are subject to continued service requirements or contingencies. These shares are not included in the denominator of the net loss per share calculation until the employee provides the requisite service resulting in the vesting of the award or the contingency is removed, or upon termination of an employee at which

 operating and reportable segments: Owned and Operated Advertising and Partner Network. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. 
 
 The CODM measures and evaluates reportable segments based on segment operating revenue as well as adjusted gross profit. The tables below include the following operating expenses that are not allocated to the reporting segments presented to our CODM : depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments. The CODM does not consider these expenses for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or to assess segment performance, however these costs are included in reported condensed consolidated net loss from continuing operations before income tax and are included in the reconciliation that follows.

Stock Appreciation Rights Plan 
 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we adopted the 2024 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the "2024 Plan"), to enhance our ability to attract, retain, and motivate individuals who are expected to make significant contributions to our future financial and operating performance. The maximum number of Class A common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards of Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") granted under the 2024 Plan ("Awards") is million shares. 
 
 Financial performance in the Plan is determined by the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA. The Plan defines Adjusted EBITDA as, with respect to any particular period, the Company s net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expenses, dividends or other distributions to equity holders, expense associated with revaluation of any warrants, costs associated with acquisitions or dispositions, deferred compensation, management fees, minority interest expense, restructuring charges, impairment and certain segment-specific adjustments, and such other adjustments as may be appropriate to accurately reflect performance, in each case, as determined by the Plan administrator. 
 
 In July 2024, we granted million SARs in accordance with the Plan. Each Award is subject to the employee's continued service through the applicable Vesting Date (as defined in the Plan) and the term of any Stock Appreciation Right shall not exceed . The SARs will vest in four equal tranches upon achieving trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA targets of million, million, million, and million. 
 
 Upon exercise, the SARs will be settled in shares of our Class A common stock or in cash at our election. We will assess whether it is probable that the award will vest for each of the four tranches at the end of every reporting period. If and when the award is deemed probable of vesting, we will recognize stock-based compensation expense for the award on a graded basis through the date of vesting. Unvested SARs are forfeited upon termination of service. 
 
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of each SARs award granted under the Plan. The expected term is estimated using the simplified method, which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual term. Volatility is based on a blend of the historical volatility of our common stock and the peer-leveraged volatility. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 Upon classifying our Protected business as held for sale as of September 30, 2023, we performed a goodwill impairment test on the Subscription reporting unit, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million. This impairment was the result of decreases in long-term forecasts due to adverse customer trends and other macroeconomic outcomes. We recorded a further impairment loss of million upon the classification of the disposal group as held for sale, for a total impairment charge of million that was recorded in the results of discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was no tax benefit of this charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this section to "the Company," "System1," "we," "us," "our" and other similar terms refer to System1, Inc and its subsidiaries. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
 
 References to "Notes" are notes included in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 have been revised to correct prior period errors as discussed in Item I, "Financial Statements - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Accordingly, this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflects the impact of those revisions. 

Company Overview 
 
 We operate an omnichannel customer acquisition platform, delivering high-intent customers to brands, advertisers and publishers . 
 
 We provide our omnichannel customer acquisition platform services through our proprietary responsive acquisition marketing platform ("RAMP"). Operating seamlessly across major advertising networks and advertising category verticals to acquire high-intent end-users, RAMP allows us to monetize these acquired end-users through our relationships with third party advertisers and advertising networks ("Advertising Partners"). RAMP operates across our network of owned and operated websites, allowing us to monetize end-user traffic that we source from various acquisition marketing channels, including Google, Facebook, Outbrain, and TikTok. RAMP also allows third party advertising platforms and publishers ("Network Partners") to send end-user traffic to, and monetize end-user traffic on, our owned and operated websites or through our monetization agreements. 
 
 Through RAMP, we ingested over 13 billion rows of data daily across approximately 40 advertising vertical categories during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . We are able to efficiently monetize user intent by linking data on consumer engagement, such as first party search data like traffic sources, device type and search queries, with data on monetization rates and advertising spend. This context-enriched data, combined with our proprietary and data science driven algorithms, creates a closed-loop system that is not reliant on personally identifiable information or information obtained through third-party cookies, but which allows RAMP to efficiently match consumer demand with the appropriate advertiser or advertising experience across advertising category verticals. 
 
 25 

We focus on monetizing user traffic acquired by our Network Partners. Since launching, it has expanded to support additional advertising formats across multiple advertising platforms, and has acquired several leading websites, enabling it to control the entire flow of the user acquisition experience, by monetizing user traffic through our network of owned and operated websites. As of September 30, 2024 , we own and operate approximately 40 websites, including leading search engines like info.com and Startpage.com , and digital media publishing websites and internet utilities, such as HowStuffWorks , MapQuest , CouponFollow and ActiveBeat . 
 
 On June 28, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as amended on November 30, 2021, January 10, 2022 and January 25, 2022), ("Business Combination Agreement") by and among us, S1 Holdco, LLC ("S1 Holdco") and Total Security Limited, formerly known as Protected.net Group Limited ("Protected"). On January 26, 2022 ("Closing Date"), we consummated the business combination ("Merger") pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement. Following the consummation of the Merger, the combined company was organized via an "Up-C" structure, in which substantially all of the assets and business operations of System1 are held by S1 Holdco. 
 
 On August 1, 2024, we undertook a corporate reorganization, the result of which was that all of the assets and business operations of System1 are now held by System1 Holdings, a newly formed intermediate holding company of which we maintain the controlling interest and in which the non-controlling interest is held by our Class C common stockholders. Following the corporate reorganization, (a) System1 Holdings now owns 100 of S1 Holdco (the previous intermediate holding company) and 100 of S1 Media, LLC S1 Media ), another new subsidiary formed in connection with the corporate reorganization, (b) S1 Media holds the assets and business operations associated with our owned and operated products businesses, which include CouponFollow, Startpage and Mapquest, and (c) S1 Holdco holds our remaining assets and business operations associated with our digital advertising businesses, including its proprietary RAMP platform. S1 Holdco and its subsidiaries remain obligors and guarantors under our Term Loan and 2022 Revolving Facility, and System1 Holdings and S1 Media are not parties thereto. 
 
 Our primary operations are in the United States, and we also have operations in Canada and the Netherlands. Operations outside the United States are subject to risks inherent in operating under different legal systems as well as various political and economic environments. Among the risks are changes in existing tax laws, changes in the regulatory framework in foreign jurisdictions, data privacy laws, possible limitations on foreign investment and income repatriation, government foreign exchange controls, exposure to currency exchange fluctuations and employment laws impacting foreign employees. We do not engage in hedging activities to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, including geopolitical developments and other macroeconomic factors such as rising interest rates, inflation and the impact of earlier supply chain disruptions, we are unable to predict the size and duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations. 
 
 Sale of Protected 
 
 We completed the sale of our Protected business on November 30, 2023. The results of operations of our Protected business prior to its sale are presented as net loss from discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the information contained in this Management Discussion and Analysis relates solely to our continuing operations and does not include the operations of our Protected business (see Item I, "Financial Statements - Note 12, Discontinued Operations" ). 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 We earn revenue by deploying components of our RAMP to our owned and operated websites to acquire and monetize end-users via advertising offerings from our Advertising Partners. For this revenue stream, we are the principal in the transaction and report revenue on a gross basis for the amounts received from our Advertising Partners. Additionally, revenue is earned from revenue-sharing arrangements with our Network Partners, whereby 
 26 

our Network Partners acquire end-users and use RAMP to monetize those end-users via our relationships with Advertising Partners. We have determined that we are the agent in these transactions and therefore report revenue on a net basis, based on the difference between amounts received by us from our Advertising Partners, less amounts remitted to our Network Partners based on the underlying revenue-sharing agreements. 
 
 We recognize revenue upon delivering user-traffic to our Advertising Partners based on a cost-per-click or cost-per-thousand impression basis. The payment terms with our Advertising Partners is typically 30 days. 
 
 Revenue may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including seasonality and the shift in mix of user acquisition sources from Advertising Partners. 
 We have two reportable segments: 
 Owned and Operated Advertising ("O O"); and 
 Partner Network. 
 
 Operating Expenses We classify our operating expenses into the following categories: 
 
 Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) . Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) primarily consists of traffic acquisition costs, which are the costs to place advertisements to acquire customers to our websites and services, as well as domain name registration costs and licensing costs to provide mapping services to Mapquest.com . We do not pre-pay any traffic acquisition costs, and therefore, such costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Salaries and benefits . Salaries and benefits expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits costs. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative . Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of fees for software services, professional services, occupancy costs and travel and entertainment. These costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investment(s) and consist of property and equipment depreciation and amortization of intangible assets with finite lives. 
 Other Expenses 
 Other expenses consist of the following: 
 
 Interest expense, net . Interest expense consists of interest on our debt and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount. 
 
 (Gain) loss from debt extinguishment . Gain from the repurchase of a portion of our Term Loan indebtedness at a discount. 
 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities . The mark to market of our liability-classified Public Warrants. 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) 
 
 We are the sole managing member of System1 Holdings and, as a result, consolidate the financial results of System1 Holdings . System1 Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, System1 Holdings is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by System1 Holdings is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including us, on a pro rata basis. We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, 
 27 

in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income or loss of System1 Holdings, as well as any stand-alone income or loss generated by us.

Revenue and Cost Metrics 
 
 The key non-financial performance metrics we use to evaluate our business, track the effectiveness of our operations and measure our performance are total advertising spend, number of Owned Operated Advertising sessions O O sessions ), number of Partner Network sessions Network sessions ), Owned Operated Advertising cost-per-session O O CPS ), Owned Operated Advertising revenue-per-session O O RPS and Partner Network revenue-per-session Network RPS ). 
 
 We define total advertising spend as the amount of advertising that is spent by us to acquire traffic to our owned and operated websites. We believe total advertising spend is a relevant measure to gauge the effectiveness of our Company to deploy capital to acquire monetizable traffic to our Owned Operated websites, which is a key driver of our Owned Operated reporting segments. 
 
 We define O O sessions as the total number of monetizable user visits to our Owned Operated Advertising websites. We define Network sessions as the number of monetizable user visits delivered by our Network Partners to RAMP. Monetizable visits exclude those visits identified by our Advertising Partners as spam, bot, or other invalid traffic. 
 
 We define O O CPS as advertising spend divided by O O sessions. We believe O O CPS is a relevant measure to gauge the efficiency of operations and processes in deploying advertising spend, especially when evaluated in combination with total advertising spend. 
 29 

We define O O RPS as O O revenue divided by O O sessions. We define Network RPS as Network Partner revenue divided by Network sessions. We believe both O O RPS and Network RPS are key measures to evaluate our effectiveness in converting monetizable traffic into revenue.

 Owned and Operated Advertising revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative period, and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparative period, O O sessions increased by approximately 1.1 billion to 2.0 billion from 920 million, and O O RPS decreased by 0.04 to 0.03 from 0.07. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparative period, O O sessions increased approximately 2.5 billion to 5.3 billion from 2.8 billion, and O O RPS decreased by 0.05 to 0.04 from 0.09. The year-over-year increases in sessions were due to the integration of new traffic acquisition sources into RAMP. The year-over-year declines in RPS were related to a mix shift to lower RPS traffic, as well as a softening of domestic advertiser demand. 
 
 Partner Network 
 
 Partner Network revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparative period, Network sessions increased approximately 1.4 billion to 2.3 billion from 894 million, and Network RPS decreased by 0.01 to 0.01 from 0.02. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparative period, Network sessions increased approximately 3.9 billion to 5.9 billion from 2.0 billion, and Network RPS decreased by 0.02 to 0.01 from 0.03. The year-over-year increases in sessions were due to the onboarding of new Network Partners. The year-over-year declines in RPS are primarily due to a softening of domestic advertiser demand and instability experienced in the Advertising Partner ecosystem generally starting in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) 
 
 Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) remained relatively consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in line with the changes in O O revenue discussed above. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 
 30 

prior year comparative periods, our O O CPS decreased 0.03 to 0.02 from 0.05 and 0.03 to 0.03 from 0.06, respectively. This is primarily due to a mix shift away to lower CPS traffic to offset the declines in RPS. 
 
 Our chief operating decision maker measures and evaluates reportable segments based on segment operating revenue as well as adjusted gross profit and other measures. We define and calculate adjusted gross profit as revenue less advertising expense incurred to acquire users. The remaining cost of revenue consists of non-advertising expenses such as set-up costs, royalties and fees. We exclude the following items from segment adjusted gross profit: depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments. 
 
 The following table presents our Adjusted gross profit by reportable segment (in thousands):

 Refer to the Revenue and Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) discussions above for explanation of the change for each period. 

Salaries and benefits 
 
 Salaries and benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative periods. T he increase for the three and nine months was primarily related to the recognition of 5.5 million and 16.1 million related to CouponFollow share-based liabilities (see Item I, "Financial Statements - Note 4, Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities"), respectively. This was partially offset by a 1.5 million and 4.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation and 1.6 million and 5.3 million decrease in severance and payroll-related expenses due to a reduction in workforce for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Selling, general, and administrative 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative periods. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.3 million and 2.5 million decrease in advisory, consulting, and legal fees, and a decrease in bad debt expense of 0.7 million and 2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Depreciation and amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative periods, primarily related to increased amortization for our continued investment in internally developed software. 
 
 31 

Interest expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative periods, primarily due to a lower debt outstanding balance in the current year as a result of paying down a significant portion of our principal balance, as well as a decline in adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") interest rates. 

(Gain) loss from debt extinguishment 
 
 (Gain) loss from debt extinguishment decreased for the three ended September 30, 2024 and increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparative periods due to the gain recognized as a result of our repurchase of debt through the Dutch auction and direct buy back that occurred in January and April of 2024, respectively. 

Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 
 The increase in fair value of our warrant liabilities for the three months and decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year comparative periods, respectively was due to the remeasurement of our warrant liability to its fair value at September 30, 2024 where the fluctuations are driven by the market value of our Class A common stock. 

Income tax expense (benefit) 
 
 The difference between the effective tax rates for the periods presented and the federal statutory tax rate of 21 was primarily due to the exclusion of non-controlling income (loss), non-deductible expenses, changes to reserves, return to provision true-ups, valuation allowance and outside basis adjustments. 

Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 
 
 Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax is comprised of the net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and only includes direct operating expenses incurred that: (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale, and (2) will not be continued by us on an ongoing basis. 
 
 Indirect expenses which supported our subscription business, and which remained as part of the continuing operations following the sale are not reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months. Our main sources of liquidity have historically been, and are expected to be from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and financing activities. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures, and our ability to meet our future debt service obligations, will depend on our ability to execute on our operational strategy and may be affected by our profitability, as well as general economic, financial and other factors which are beyond our control. 
 
 We continue to develop and implement plans to improve our liquidity. Our main focus is executing on our operational strategy, which includes continued focus on expanding the number of advertising partners that are utilizing or integrated with RAMP by continuing to attract and monetize users with commercial intent on our owned and operated web properties and on behalf of our network partners as well as optimizing bids and driving higher returns on advertising spend. Additionally, we are focused on our current cost structure by reducing our cash operating expenses and debt service obligations. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results. 
 
 32 

As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 69.1 million and 50.0 million available to borrow on our 2022 Revolving Facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash outflows of 69.9 million. The principal drivers of our cash outflows were 56.8 million repayment of our Term Loan, 11.3 million related to net change in operations and 4.9 million of software development costs, offset by a 5.2 million working capital changes. 

Credit Facilities 
 
 See Item 1, "Financial Statements - Note 5, Debt, Net" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (6,027) (5,908) Net cash used in investing activities (4,962) (6,859) Net cash used in financing activities (58,950) (1,054) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily impacted by growth in our operations, timing of collections from our partner and related payments to our suppliers for advertising inventory and data. We typically pay suppliers in advance of collections from our clients and our collection and payment cycles can vary from period to period. In addition, seasonality may impact cash flows from operating activities on a sequential quarterly basis during the year. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities of 6.0 million resulted primarily from favorable changes in net income, excluding the impact of non-cash items offset by favorable changes in working capital balances. The favorable changes in working capital balances included an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities offset by an increase in account receivable balances. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities of 5.9 million resulted primarily from net loss adjusted for noncash items, including the impairment of goodwill and assets held for sale of 118.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 85.4 million, stock-based compensation of 44.1 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of 17.8 million. This was partially offset by a net loss of 249.1 million and a payment of long-term earnout liabilities of 20.0 million. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our primary investing activities consisted of costs capitalized for internally developed software. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities of 5.0 million and 6.9 million resulted primarily from costs capitalized for internally developed software, respectively. 
 
 33 

Financing Activities 
 
 Our financing activities consisted primarily of repayments of our indebtedness under our credit facilities. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities of 59.0 million was primarily related to the repayment of the 2022 Term Note in the amount of 56.8 million. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities of 1.1 million resulted primarily from repayment of our existing term loan of 15.0 million, taxes paid related to net settlement of stock awards of 3.1 million, and payment of acquisition holdback of 1.9 million. This was partially offset by net proceeds from a related-party revolver of 19.0 million. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented other than the indemnification agreements. 

Contractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements 
 
 Service Agreements 
 
 In June 2021, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a service provider whereby we are contractually obligated to spend 5.0 million annually between July 2023 and June 2026 . As of September 30, 2024 , we remain contractually obligated to spend a remaining 8.0 million towards this commitment. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 From time to time, we are subject to contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not currently believe the resolution of any such contingencies will have a material adverse effect upon our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Preparing these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 The critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe to have the most significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements are stock-based compensation, business combinations and valuation of goodwill and income taxes. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 
 As a "smaller reporting company", as defined by Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide this information. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports required to be filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 The material weaknesses identified were as follows: 
 
 We did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically, we lacked a sufficient number of professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately. Additionally, the limited personnel resulted in an inability to consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities in pursuit of financial reporting objectives, as demonstrated by, among other things, insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions. 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement. Specifically, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement to financial reporting. 
 
 These material weaknesses contributed to the following additional material weaknesses: 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls to timely analyze and record the financial statement effects from complex, non-routine transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and post-combination compensation arrangements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls over the application of US GAAP to such transactions, and, as it relates to acquisitions, did not design and maintain effective controls over (i) the review of the inputs and assumptions used in the measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including discounted cash flow analysis to value acquired intangible assets at an appropriate level of precision, (ii) the tax impacts of acquisitions to the financial statements, and (iii) conforming of US GAAP and accounting policies of acquired entities to that of the Company. In addition, we did not design and maintain effective controls relating to the oversight and ongoing recording of the financial statement results of the acquired businesses. 
 We did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over (i) the 
 35 

preparation and review of business performance reviews, account reconciliations, journal entries, and identification of asset groups and (ii) maintaining appropriate segregation of duties. Additionally, we did not design and maintain controls over the classification and presentation of accounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, including the statement of cash flows. 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls over accounting for accrued liabilities, stock-based compensation and equity transactions, including accounting for non-controlling interest. 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls over the accuracy and valuation of goodwill, including the allocation of goodwill to reporting units and the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment. 
 
 These material weaknesses resulted in the revision to the consolidated financial statements for each of the three quarterly periods in the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 These material weaknesses also resulted in an immaterial misstatement within cash flows from operating activities of System1, Inc. as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and within stockholders' equity of the consolidated financial statements of System1, Inc. as of December 31, 2023 and all quarterly periods during 2023. 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for complex financial instruments, including the impact of these instruments on earnings per share. 
 
 This material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of the Trebia warrant liabilities, change in the fair value of the Trebia warrant liabilities, forward purchase agreement liabilities, change in the fair value of the forward purchase agreement liabilities, classification of redeemable shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with Trebia s initial public offering, additional paid-in-capital, accumulated deficit, Earnings Per Share, and related financial disclosures of Trebia Acquisition Corp. in prior periods not presented in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of substantially all of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology ("IT") general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: 
 i. program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; 
 ii. user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate Company personnel; 
 iii. computer operations controls to ensure that critical batch jobs are monitored and data backups are authorized and monitored; and 
 iv. testing and approval controls for program development to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements. 
 
 These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to the financial statements; however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined these IT deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness. 
 
 36 

Remediation Plan for the Material Weaknesses 
 
 We are in the process of, and we are focused on, designing and implementing effective measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses. Our remediation efforts to address the identified material weaknesses are ongoing. Our efforts include a number of actions: 
 
 Assessed the need of additional senior level accounting personnel with applicable technical accounting knowledge, training, and experience in accounting matters, and hired the appropriately skilled resources; continuing to assess the needs within the accounting department; 
 Designing and implementing controls to formalize roles and review responsibilities to align with our team s skills and experience and designing and implementing controls ensuring segregation of duties; 
 Engaged an accounting advisory firm to assist with the documentation, evaluation, remediation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission; 
 Engaged third-party specialists to assist with the preparation of technical accounting analyses and valuations associated with business combinations, and ensuring adequate review by accounting personnel with applicable technical accounting knowledge, training, and experience in accounting for business combinations or dispositions; 
 Designing and implementing controls to address the financial reporting risks over the accounting for dispositions, acquisitions and other complex, non-routine transactions, including controls over the preparation and review of accounting memoranda addressing these matters, valuations and key assumptions utilized in the valuations, tax impacts, and ongoing recording of the financial statement results of the acquired businesses; 
 Designing and implementing formal accounting policies with periodic reviews, procedures and controls supporting our period-end financial reporting process, including controls over the preparation and review of account reconciliations and journal entries, business performance reviews, foreign exchange gains/losses for intercompany transactions, appropriate determination of asset groups for impairment consideration and classification and presentation of accounts and disclosures, including the statement of cash flows; 
 Designing and implementing controls to address the financial reporting risks over accrued liabilities, stock-based compensation and equity transactions, including accounting for non-controlling interest; 
 Designing and implementing controls to address the financial reporting risks over the accounting for complex financial instruments, including the earnings per share impacts; 
 Designing and implementing controls to address the financial reporting risks over the accuracy and valuation of goodwill, including the allocation of goodwill to reporting units and the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment; 
 Designing and implementing IT general controls, including controls over change management, the review and update of user access rights and privileges, controls over batch jobs and data backups, and program development approvals and testing. 
 
 We believe the measures described above will facilitate the remediation of the material weaknesses we have identified and will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to review, optimize and enhance our processes, procedures and controls. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies, or we may modify, or in appropriate circumstances not complete, certain of the remediation measures described above. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Therefore, these material weaknesses have not been remediated as of September 30, 2024 .
