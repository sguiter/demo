Land 
 
 The Company holds approximately acres of land. Most of this land was acquired between 1911 and 1932 and is carried in the Company s balance sheets at cost. More than acres are located in West Maui and are comprised of largely contiguous parcels which extend from the ocean to an elevation of approximately feet. The West Maui landholdings include approximately acres within Kapalua Resort, a master-planned, destination resort and residential community. Approximately acres are located in Upcountry Maui in an area commonly known as Hali imaile and is mainly comprised of leased agricultural fields, commercial and light industrial properties. 
 
 Land Improvements 
 
 Land improvements are primarily comprised of roads, utilities, and landscaping infrastructure improvements at the Kapalua Resort. Also included are the Company s potable and non-potable water systems in West Maui. A majority of the Company s land improvements were either constructed and placed in service in the mid-to-late 1970s or conveyed in 2017. Depreciation expense would be considerably higher if these assets were stated at current replacement cost. 

Buildings 
 
 The Company holds approximately square feet of leasable area on Maui. The buildings are comprised of restaurant, retail, and light industrial spaces located at the Kapalua Resort and in Haliimaile. A majority of the Company s buildings were constructed and placed in service in the mid-to-late 1970s. Depreciation expense would be considerably higher if these assets were stated at current replacement cost. 
 
 Machinery and Equipment 
 
 Machinery and equipment are mainly comprised of zipline course equipment installed at the Kapalua Resort in 2008 and used in the Company s leasing operations. 
 
 Construction in Progress

acres of former pineapple lands in Hali imaile valued at million. There were no proceeds from the transaction as the land was an equity contribution to the joint venture and was recognized as land development and sales operating revenues. However, after reevaluating the accounting treatment of the transaction, it was determined that the million should have been presented as a nonoperating gain on the derecognition of the land rather than operating revenue. The Company does not consider the misclassification to be material and intends on restating the gain in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 -K for fiscal year 2024, anticipated to be filed in March 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company expensed on behalf of BRE2 LLC which was recorded as an additional capital contribution to BRE2 LLC. According to terms of the Operating Agreement for BRE2 LLC, net proceeds from the sales of improved agricultural lots will be distributed when the funds are available for distribution. Although the Company holds a majority of the equity of BRE2 LLC, the Company does not control BRE2 LLC, and as a result, BRE2 LLC is presented in the Company s financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

million revolving line of credit facility Credit Facility with First Hawaiian Bank Bank maturing on December 31, 2025. At September 30, 2024, million was available from our Credit Facility, as the Company borrowed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Credit Facility provides options for revolving or term loan borrowing. Interest on loan borrowing is based on the Bank s prime rate minus percentage points. Interest on term loan borrowing may be fixed at the Bank s commercial loan rates using an interest rate swap option. The Company has pledged approximately square feet of commercial leased space in the Kapalua Resort as security for the Credit Facility. Net proceeds from the sale of any collateral are required to be repaid toward outstanding borrowings and will permanently reduce the Credit Facility s revolving commitment amount. There are no commitment fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. 
 
 The terms of the Credit Facility include various representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. Financial covenants include a minimum liquidity (as defined) of million, a maximum of million in total liabilities, and a limitation of new indebtedness on collateralized properties without the prior written consent of the Bank. 

The outstanding balance of the Credit Facility was at September 30, 2024 and zero at December 31, 2023. The Company was in compliance with Credit Facility at September 30, 2024.

In 2009, the Non-qualified Plan was frozen, and in 2011, the pension benefits under the Defined Plan were frozen.

The Board of Directors (the Board approved the termination of the Defined Plan and the Non-qualified Plan in 2023.

The construction of additional leach fields and installation of a surface aerator, sludge removal system, and natural pond cover using water plants were completed in 2023. Test results from wastewater monitoring indicate effluent concentration amounts within allowable ranges. A feasibility study was prepared for and submitted to the Company on January 15, 2024, identifying various technical solutions that could be implemented to resolve the Order. The DOH agreed to defer the Order on February 15, 2024, as the Company continues to work to resolve and remediate the facility s wastewater effluent issues through an approved corrective action plan. The Company submitted a plan (the Plan) and proposed solution to resolve the Order on March 14, 2024. The Plan included the installation of an additional pond that will be lined and installed with aerators. One of the existing ponds will be lined and renovated as necessary and the other pond will be taken offline and used as a backup pond if needed. The Company continues to work with the DOH to coordinate the timing and approval of the Plan to implement the technical solution to resolve the Order. Meetings continue to be scheduled to provide status updates and progress being made towards resolution. 
 
 In addition, from time to time, the Company is the subject of various other claims, complaints and other legal actions which arise in the normal and ordinary course of the Company s business activities. The Company believes the resolution of these other matters, in the aggregate, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or operations.

 Share-based compensation expenses totaled million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in these amounts were million and million of restricted common stock vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million of stock options vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation expense totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in these amounts were million and million of restricted common stock vested during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million of stock options vested during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, R. Scot Sellers, a director and Chairman of the Board, Stephen M. Case, a director, and Race A. Randle, Chief Executive Officer, voluntarily executed agreements to cancel previously granted stock options and common stock grants. The Equity Plan was amended in February 2023 to increase the limit on the number of shares to be awarded during a plan year to shares. In 2023, Mr. Sellers received options to purchase shares and shares of common stock that exceeded the share limit. In February 2024, Mr. Randle received shares of common stock that exceeded the share limit. In addition, although grants to Mr. Case did not exceed the Equity Plan limit, he voluntarily opted to cancel the common stock grants and options issued to him in 2023 amounting to shares and shares, respectively, and options and restricted shares issued in 2024 amounting to shares and shares, respectively. The cancellation of the options and common stock grants resulted in recognizing the remaining unvested awards of options and common stock grants immediately. In the third quarter of 2024, was recognized as expense due to the cancellations, due to the cancellation of Mr. Case s options and common stock grants and due to the cancellation of Mr. Randle s common stock grants.

acres of vacant land to the State in an area known as Honokeana, near Napili in Lahaina, Maui. The land will be leased to the State at no cost for five years, plus the duration of time necessary to construct the temporary homes. The land is a portion of a larger, -acre parcel owned by the Company. 
 
 The Honokeana Agreement provides the State will fund all costs to complete the project, including approximately to complete the necessary horizontal improvements. The Company has agreed to administer and manage the construction of the horizontal improvements and, at the State s election, the subsequent vertical improvements, at cost of which have yet to be estimated. The Company will provide its administration services to the State at its cost and will not directly profit from these services. After the end of the lease, the State will remove any vertical improvements unless MLP requests that specific improvements remain.

Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences in our actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those discussed elsewhere within this Quarterly Report, particularly in the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Depending upon the context, the terms the Company, we, our, and us, refer to either Maui Land Pineapple Company, Inc. alone, or to Maui Land Pineapple Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Maui Land Pineapple Company, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and the successor to a business organized in 1909 as a Hawaii corporation. The Company reincorporated from Hawaii to Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion completed on July 18, 2022. Total authorized capital stock of the Company includes 48,000,000 shares, consisting of 43,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.0001 per share. Shares of the Company s common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MLP. The Company consists of a landholding and operating parent company, has a principal subsidiary, Kapalua Land Company, Ltd., and certain other subsidiaries 
 
 We own and manage a diverse portfolio including over 22,400 acres of land on the island of Maui, Hawaii along with 247,000 square feet of commercial real estate. For over a century, we have built a legacy of authentic innovation through conservation, agriculture, community building and land management. Our current portfolio of assets includes unimproved land, entitled land allowing for various residential and mixed-use construction, and completed commercial properties. 
 
 In April 2023, a leadership transition was initiated by appointing a new Chief Executive Officer and new Chairman of the Board, both of whom are experienced in large scale real estate portfolio management including master planning, community building, and asset management. The strengthening of our team has continued through September 2024 with the addition of team members with localized experience including planning, engineering, permitting, community development, land and natural resource stewardship, and asset management.

To continue our over 100-year legacy, we are driven by a renewed mission to strategically maximize the use of our assets, resulting in added value to the Company and improved quality of life on Maui for future generations. 
 
 As a key initiative of the new leadership team, we have advanced efforts to maximize the productivity of our leasable land and commercial properties. At September 30, 2024, our commercial properties and land were occupied at the following levels:

Year to date, the team has increased commercial property occupancy from 72 to 86 , including tenant relocations and improvements necessary to enhance the variety and quality of experiences in our town centers. This effort will continue, along with capital improvements necessary to continue attracting top tier tenants. In addition to stable cashflow in a supply-constrained market, our commercial properties allow us to perform value-creating placemaking for our surrounding landholdings. We anticipate cashflow from our commercial properties to increase in the coming years, as we reach stabilization and fund the near-term costs for tenant improvements and leasing costs inherent with new tenancies. 
 
 To enable the productive use of land for homes, businesses, farms, resort projects, or otherwise, we generally must make improvements to the land. These improvements take the form of master planning, entitlements and zoning, subdivision into useful lot sizes, and the addition of infrastructure, enabling it to be placed into productive use. In 2024 we completed portfolio-wide strategic plans across all 22,400 acres to prioritize and guide actions of the Company in the forthcoming quarters.

As a result of this strategic planning effort, our team is underway with concurrent activities to activate our land holdings to meet the long-term needs of the community, including the provision of land for agriculture and housing. 
 
 Near-term sales revenues (1-3 years) may be anticipated from our remnant and non-strategic parcels for sale, along with improved land in active marketing for sale and/or development with partner(s). 
 
 Unimproved land in active planning and improvements will likely require three or more years before improvements are completed and revenue generation is realized. Funding for soft cost improvements, if not covered by our commercial properties and land leasing cashflow, will likely be provided by remnant non-strategic parcel sales and our revolving line of credit. As infrastructure and site improvement hard costs are warranted, capital will primarily be provided by project presale deposits and construction financing. 
 
 For the Honokeana Homes project, 50 acres will be leased to the State of Hawaii for up to seven years with no lease revenue. The State of Hawaii will fund the hard and soft costs to make horizontal improvements to the land and has set aside an initial 35.5 million for the project. The Company will administer the horizontal improvements utilizing third party contractors, on a cost recovery basis with no direct profit from the administrative work. If the State selects the Company to administer the home construction, the Company will similarly intend to do so on a cost recovery basis. 
 
 Unimproved land identified for long-term lease and ongoing asset management may be expected to be leased or licensed for diversified agricultural, conservation, and cultural uses for the next ten or more years. This land includes the Pu u Kukui Watershed, which is over 8,600 acres and is actively managed to maximize rainfall capture and recharge of the aquifer which provides approximately 70 of the water consumed in West Maui. As most of the agricultural land was irrigated, graded, and actively farmed in prior decades, it has high potential for productive agricultural use. The Company is focused on increasing the occupancy of these agricultural lands to improve productivity via economic activity and local food production.

Land development and sales operating revenues include the sales of our real estate inventory. There was one sale of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounting to 200,000 for a land easement in West Maui and no sales of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is purposeful as the Company is evaluating its commercial assets and land holdings to determine the best utilization of its assets in West Maui and in Upcounty Maui in the town of Haliimaile to increase value.

In December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the Kapalua Central Resort project for 40.0 million. On May 13, 2022, terms of the agreement were amended to include a closing condition requiring the Maui Planning Commission to approve a five-year extension of a Special Management Area (SMA) permit issued by the County of Maui. We allowed the agreement to expire on April 11, 2023. The development plans for our real estate holdings remain subject to our review and evaluation. The Kapalua Central Resort project continues to be marketed for sale or development with partner(s) and the application for the SMA permit extension remains ongoing. 
 
 In December 2023, we contributed approximately 30-acres of land in Upcountry Maui, valued at 1.6 million, to BRE2 LLC, a joint venture between the Company and Stone Properties, for the development and sales of ranch lots. There were no proceeds from the transaction as the land was an equity contribution to the joint venture and was recognized as land development and sales operating revenues. However, after review, it was determined that the 1.6 million should have been presented as a gain on the derecognition of the land asset rather than operating revenue. This restatement in the treatment of the 1.6 million gain will be made in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2024, anticipated to be filed in March 2025. We anticipate sales of the ranch lots to total approximately 4.1 million, with approximately 50 constituting our share of the sales proceeds, which we expect to occur between the fourth quarter of 2024 to mid-2025. 
 
 Approximately 687,000 was spent towards real estate development expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for development efforts both in West Maui and Haliimaile. Approximately 526,000 in development expenditures were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 On August 14, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an 11.883-acre parcel of land, located in Piiholo, Maui, Hawaii for 7.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchaser elected to cancel the sale. As a result, the Company did not recognize any revenue associated with the agreement and the 11.883-acre Piiholo parcel will be marketed for sale as a non-strategic land parcel. 
 
 Land development and sales are cyclical and depend on several factors, such as interest rates and demand. Results from one period are not indicative of future performance trends in this business segment. Prior to the Maui wildfires which occurred on August 8, 2023, there was a shortage of primary housing supply on Maui. While the provision of land to generate primary housing and additional jobs was a priority of ours prior to the wildfires, the loss of over 2,000 homes and over 3,000 jobs in the Maui wildfire accelerated our efforts to get land into productive use to meet these critical needs.

Operating revenues from leasing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were comprised primarily of 2.2 million from commercial, industrial, and agricultural leases, and the remaining 0.5 million was primarily comprised of 67,000 of licensing fees from our registered trademarks and trade names, 249,000 from potable and non-potable water system sales and 85,000 in grant revenue from the State of Hawai i for conservation management of our Pu u Kukui Watershed. Operating revenue from leasing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily comprised of 1.3 million from commercial, industrial, and agricultural leases, and the remaining 0.6 million was comprised of 188,000 of licensing fees from our registered trademarks and trade names, 312,000 from potable and non-potable water system sales and 85,000 in grant revenue from the State of Hawai i for conservation management of our Puu Kukui Watershed. 
 
 Certain rental income is contingent upon the sales of tenants exceeding a defined threshold and recognized as a percentage of sales after those thresholds are achieved. As the COVID-19 pandemic waned, visitor traffic to Maui began to increase and these percentage rents, leasing revenues in general and land licensing from adventure tourism tenants were returning to pre-pandemic levels until the occurrence of the devastating Maui wildfires on August 8, 2023. The wildfires directly and critically impacted West Maui and took its toll on percentage rents and revenues for tourism based tenants. The 2.7 million of operating revenues from leasing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is an indication that tourism and visitor traffic is returning to pre-pandemic levels. The increase in operating revenues at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, is reflective of our efforts to re-tenant and re-merchandise the tenant mix in the three commercial centers owned by the Company in the Kapalua Resort, Haliimaile Town and the Alaeloa Business Park. New tenant leases are typically being executed with an initial free rent period to reflect current market rental rates. 
 
 The increase in leasing operating costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, can be attributed to higher property maintenance costs for our commercial leasing portfolio properties, which had been deferred in prior years, hiring a property management and leasing firm to increase occupancy of our leasing portfolio, and the start-up costs and fees associated with our efforts to improve the tenant composition in our leasing portfolio.

Our resort amenities and other segment includes the operations of the Kapalua Club, a private, non-equity club that provides its members special programs and access and other privileges at certain of the amenities at the Kapalua Resort, including a 30,000 square foot full-service spa and fitness center, a private pool-side dining beach club, and two 18-hole championship golf courses. The Kapalua Club does not own or operate any resort amenities and the member dues collected are primarily used to pay contracted fees to provide access for its members to the spa, beach club and other resort amenities. 
 
 The increase in operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to new memberships being sold for the first time since 2019. 
 
 Contracted fee expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to decreased fees for access and utilization of amenities. 
 
 The Kapalua Club was restructured in 2023. Its revised policies and practices have been implemented to better align club dues and club expenses. The Kapalua Club began to accept new membership applications beginning late 2023. 
 
 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
 
 General and administrative costs and share-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 8.0 million, compared to 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Share-based compensation costs and share-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 4.7 million, compared to 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.2 million increase is attributable to option valuation expenses resulting from the options granted to our Chief Executive Officer in January 2024, options granted to our directors in May 2024, which were at a higher valuation from the options granted to directors in May 2023, and the options and shares cancellation that took place in August 2024. These differences are explained in the paragraphs below. Shared based compensation expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included options for the Chairman of the Board issued in March 2023, options issued to directors in May 2023, options issued to the Chief Executive Officer in January 2024, options issued to directors in May 2024, stock grants to directors in 2024, cancellations of certain stock grants and options in August 2024, and employees incentive share vesting. Share-based compensation expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included options for the Chairman of the Board issued in March 2023, options issued to directors in May 2023, employees incentive share vesting and incentive share vesting for the former Chief Executive Officer upon separation from the Company on March 31, 2023. 
 
 An option to purchase 400,000 shares of the Company s common stock under the 2017 Equity and Incentive Award Plan (the Plan) was granted to the Company's Chief Executive Officer during the three months ended March 31, 2024, none of these options shares vested during this period. Additional information of the option issuance to the Chief Executive Officer is detailed in Note 11 of the financial statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 422,084 shares of stock options vested which were comprised of 82,000 option shares issued to directors in May 2023, 340,084 option shares issued to directors in May 2024 and 133,334 option shares issued to the Chairman of the Board in March 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 164,000 option shares were vested under options issued to directors in March 2023. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, R. Scot Sellers, a director and Chairman of the Board, Stephen M. Case, a director, and Race A. Randle, Chief Executive Officer, voluntarily executed agreements to cancel previously granted stock options and common stock grants. The Equity Plan was amended in February 2023 to increase the limit on the number of shares to be awarded during a plan year to 400,000 shares. In 2023, Mr. Sellers received options to purchase 63,500 shares and 18,804 shares of common stock that exceeded the 400,000 share limit. In February 2024, Mr. Randle received 28,511 shares of common stock that exceeded the 400,000 share limit. In addition, although grants to Mr. Case did not exceed the Equity Plan limit, he voluntarily opted to cancel the common stock grants and options issued to him in 2023 amounting to 6,659 shares and 56,000 shares, respectively, and options and restricted shares issued in 2024 amounting to 3,124 shares and 56,000 shares, respectively. The cancellation of the options and common stock grants resulted in recognizing the remaining unvested awards of options and common stock grants immediately. In the third quarter of 2024, 631,000 was recognized as expense due to the cancellations, 402,000 due to the cancellation of Mr. Case s options and common stock grants and 229,000 due to the cancellation of Mr. Randle s common stock grants.

 We also had investments in a bond fund with varying maturities in the amount of 3.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our investments consist of corporate bond securities maturing on various dates through November 2025. These bond investments yield approximately 3.4 at September 30, 2024. We intend to hold our bond securities until maturity. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, 12.0 million was available from our revolving line of credit facility Credit Facility with First Hawaiian Bank Bank ), as the Company borrowed 3,000,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Credit Facility, which matures on December 31, 2025, provides for revolving or term loan borrowing options. Interest on revolving loan borrowings is calculated using the Bank s prime rate minus 1.125 percentage points. Interest on term loan borrowing is fixed at the Bank s commercial loan rates with interest rate swap options available. We have pledged approximately 30,000 square feet of commercial leased space in the Kapalua Resort as security for the Credit Facility. Net proceeds from the sale of any collateral are required to be repaid toward outstanding borrowings and will permanently reduce the Credit Facility s revolving commitment amount. There are no commitment fees on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. 
 
 The terms of the Credit Facility include various representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. Financial covenants include a minimum liquidity (as defined in the Credit Facility) of 2.0 million, a maximum of 45.0 million in total liabilities, and a limitation on new indebtedness. 
 
 We were in compliance with the covenants of our Credit Facility at September 30, 2024. We may borrow under our credit facility to invest in, and build value in, our assets and fund working capital if economic conditions are negatively impacted in future periods. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Net cash provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million and net cash used in our operating activities was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 There was one sale of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the amount of 0.2 million for a land easement in West Maui and no sales of real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest income earned from our money market and bond investments was 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The outstanding balance of our Credit Facility was 3,000,000 at September 30, 2024. There were no interest payments due on our Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 No contributions are required to be made to our defined benefit pension plan in 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Our business initiatives include investing in our operating infrastructure and continued planning and entitlement efforts on our development projects. At times, this may require borrowing under our Credit Facility or other indebtedness, repayment of which may be dependent on selling of our real estate assets at acceptable prices in condensed timeframes. We believe our cash and investment balances, cash provided from ongoing operating activities, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements, contractual obligations, and timely service our debt obligations for the next months and the foreseeable longer term.

8. 

Liquidated Damages. When the CONTRACTOR is given notice of delay or nonperformance as specified in paragraph 9 (Termination for Default) and fails to cure in the time specified, it is agreed the CONTRACTOR shall pay to the STATE the amount, if any, set forth in this Contract per calendar day from the date set for cure until either (i) the STATE reasonably obtains similar goods or services, or both, if the CONTRACTOR is terminated for default, or (ii) until the CONTRACTOR provides the goods or services, or both, if the CONTRACTOR is not terminated for default. The CONTRACTOR remains liable for damages caused other than by delay. 

9. 

Termination for Default. 

a. 

Default. If the CONTRACTOR refuses or fails to perform any of the provisions of this Contract with such diligence as will ensure its completion within the time specified in this Contract, or any extension thereof, otherwise fails to timely satisfy the Contract provisions, or commits any other substantial breach of this Contract, the STATE may notify the CONTRACTOR in writing of the delay or non-performance and if not cured in thirty(30) days or any longer time specified in writing by the STATE, the STATE may terminate the CONTRACTOR'S right to proceed with the Contract or such part of the Contract as to which there has been delay or a failure to properly perform. In the event of termination in whole or in part, the STATE may procure similar goods or services in a manner and upon the terms deemed appropriate by the STATE.

CONTRACTOR'S duties. Notwithstanding termination of the Contract and subject to any directions from the STATE, the CONTRACTOR shall take timely, reasonable, and necessary action to protect and preserve property in the possession of the CONTRACTOR in which the STATE has an interest. 

c. 

Compensation. Payment for completed goods and services delivered and accepted by the STATE shall be at the price set forth in the Contract. Payment for the protection and preservation of property shall be in an amount agreed upon by the CONTRACTOR and the STATE. The STATE may withhold from amounts due the CONTRACTOR such sums as the STATE deems to be necessary to protect the STATE against loss because of outstanding liens or claims. 

d. 

Erroneous termination for default. If, after notice of termination of the CONTRACTOR'S right to proceed under this paragraph, it is determined for any reason that the CONTRACTOR was not in default under this paragraph, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the notice of termination had been issued pursuant to paragraph 10.

Additional rights and remedies. The rights and remedies provided in this paragraph are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this Contract.

The CONTRACTOR shall, upon direction of the STATE, protect and preserve property in the possession of the CONTRACTOR in which the STATE has an interest. If the STATE does not exercise this right, the CONTRACTOR shall use best efforts to sell such goods and manufacturing materials. Use of this paragraph in no way implies that the STATE has breached the Contract by exercise of the termination for convenience provision. 

13

d. 

Compensation. 

(1) 

The CONTRACTOR shall submit a termination claim specifying the amounts due because of the termination for convenience together with the cost or pricing data bearing on such claim.

(2) 

The STATE and the CONTRACTOR may agree to a settlement provided the CONTRACTOR has filed a termination claim supported by cost or pricing data submitted as required and that the settlement does not exceed the total Contract price plus settlement costs reduced by payments previously made by the STATE, the proceeds of any sales of goods and manufacturing materials under subparagraph 10c, and the Contract price of the performance not terminated.
