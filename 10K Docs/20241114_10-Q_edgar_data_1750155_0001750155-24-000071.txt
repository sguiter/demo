 There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy and there were no changes in the fair value methodologies during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Investment in Unconsolidated Entity 
 On April 6, 2023, the Company jointly formed an entity, DeFloria, with AJNA BioSciences PBC ("AJNA"), and a subsidiary of British American Tobacco PLC (LSE: BATS and NYSE: BTI) ("BAT"). AJNA is a botanical drug development company. AJNA is partially owned and was co-founded by a co-founder of Charlotte's Web. The entity was established to pursue FDA-approval for a botanical drug to target a certain neurological condition. 
 BAT holds an equity interest in DeFloria in the form of or preferred units following its million initial investment and has the right to participate in future equity issuances to maintain its pro rata equity position. In 2024, BAT and AJNA invested an additional million and million, respectively, into DeFloria in exchange for a convertible debenture. The Company and AJNA each hold or approximately , respectively, of DeFloria's voting common units. The Company's contribution to DeFloria is a license

 shares of Class A Common Stock of AJNA for an exercise price of per share. Management determined the warrant should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 321, which requires the warrant to be measured at fair value at issuance and subsequently remeasured at fair value each reporting period. All changes from the remeasurement of the warrant will be recorded as a change in fair value of financial instruments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company determined the fair value of the AJNA warrants to be de minimis and as such no value was recorded as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company determined that it has a variable interest in the investment in DeFloria; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of DeFloria as it lacks the power to direct DeFloria's key activities. The Company concluded that the investment in DeFloria should not be consolidated. The maximum exposure to loss in the investment in DeFloria is limited to the Company's investment, which is represented by the financial statement carrying amount of its retained interest. 
 In accordance with ASC 825-10, equity method investments are eligible for the fair value option as they represent recognized financial assets. As the Company is not required to consolidate the investment and does not meet any of the other scope exceptions, the Company had the ability to adopt the fair value option for the investment at inception. Upon formation of the entity, the Company elected the fair value option because it allowed the investment to be valued based on current market conditions. For the nine month ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a gain for the initial investment in DeFloria of within gain on initial investment in unconsolidated entity in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The investment has been remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as changes in fair value of financial instruments for the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, a gain of and , respectively, related to the investment in DeFloria was recognized as a change in fair value of financial instruments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, a gain of and , respectively, related to the investment in DeFloria was recognized as a change in fair value of financial instruments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the DeFloria investment represents an investment of and , respectively, within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The use of assumptions for the fair value determination includes a high degree of subjectivity and judgment using unobservable inputs (level 3 on the fair value hierarchy), which results in estimation uncertainty. To determine the value of the investment, the Company utilizes an Option Pricing Model ("OPM"). The OPM considers the various terms of the stockholder agreements, including the level of seniority among the securities, dividend policy, conversion ratios, and cash allocations upon liquidation of the entity. The OPM is appropriate when the range of potential future outcomes is difficult to predict with any certainty.

 million (C million) convertible debenture (the "debenture"). The debenture was denominated in Canadian Dollars ("CAD" or "C "). The debenture is convertible into ownership of the Company's common shares at a conversion price of C per common share of the Company on the TSX. The debenture will accrue interest at a stated annualized rate of until such time that there is federal regulation permitting the use of cannabidiol, a phytocannabinoid derived from the plant Cannabis sativa L. as an ingredient in food products and dietary supplements in the United States. (The term "federal regulation" is defined as the date that federal laws in the United States permit, authorize or do not prohibit the use of CBD as an ingredient in food products and dietary supplements). Following federal regulation of CBD, the annualized rate of interest shall reduce to . The maturity date for the debenture is November 14, 2029 (the "Maturity Date"). 
 Debt Interest Rate Conversion Feature 
 The debt interest rate conversion feature is classified as a financial asset and is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as changes in fair value of financial instruments for the period. The use of assumptions for the fair value determination includes a high degree of subjectivity and judgment using unobservable inputs (level 3 on the fair value hierarchy), which results in estimation uncertainty. The debt interest rate conversion feature, if triggered, reduces the stated interest rate of the debenture to 1.5 upon federal regulation of CBD in the United States. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, a gain of and a loss of , respectively, related to the debt interest rate conversion feature was recognized as a change in fair value of financial instruments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, a gain of and a loss , respectively, related to the debt interest rate conversion feature was recognized as a change in fair value of financial instruments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the debt interest rate conversion feature represents a financial asset of and , respectively, within SBH purchase option and other derivative assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 To determine the value of the debt interest rate conversion feature, the Company utilizes a probability weighted income approach. This method calculates the present value of the reduced interest accrued on the debenture assuming the feature is triggered at a certain time, after accounting for the probability of federal regulation of CBD. This approach is useful when ultimate valuation is based on an unverifiable outcome, such as an event outside of the Company's influence.

 Debt Conversion Option 
 Per the debenture, the Lender has the option, at any time before the Maturity Date at no additional consideration, for all or any part of the principal amount to be converted into fully paid and non-assessable common shares. The Company assessed this conversion feature and determined that the debt conversion option is an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation and is classified as a financial liability within the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The debt conversion option is initially measured at fair value and is revalued at each reporting period using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on Level 2 observable inputs. The assumptions used by the Company are the quoted price of the Company's common shares in an active market, risk-free interest rate, volatility and expected life, and assumes

 Stanley Brothers USA Holdings Purchase Option 
 In 2021, the Company entered into an option purchase agreement (the "SBH Purchase Option") with Stanley Brothers USA Holdings, Inc ("Stanley Brothers USA"). The SBH Purchase Option was purchased for total consideration of and has a term of (extendable for an additional upon payment of additional consideration). The SBH Purchase Option provides the Company the option to acquire all or substantially all the shares of Stanley Brothers USA at a purchase price to be determined at the time of exercise of the SBH Purchase Option. Upon exercise of the SBH Purchase Option, the purchase price will be determined based on application of predetermined multiples of Stanley Brothers USA revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") measures. The Company is not obligated to exercise the SBH Purchase Option. As part of the SBH Purchase Option agreement, Stanley Brothers USA issued the Company a warrant exercisable to purchase of the outstanding Stanley Brothers USA shares and convertible securities that are considered in-the-money, subject to certain conditions and exclusions. The warrant is exercisable at the Company's election for a nominal exercise price in the event the Company elects not to acquire all or substantially all shares of Stanley Brothers USA and expires days after the expiration of the option. 
 The Company elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825-10 guidance to record its SBH Purchase Option. The SBH Purchase Option is classified as a financial asset and is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes to fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the period. The use of assumptions for the fair value determination includes a high degree of subjectivity and judgment using unobservable inputs (level 3 on the fair value hierarchy), which results in estimation uncertainty. Changes in assumptions that reasonably could have been different at the reporting date may result in a higher or lower determination of fair value. Changes in fair value measurements, if significant, may affect performance of cash flows. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, a loss of and a gain of , respectively, related to the SBH Purchase Option was recognized as change in fair value of financial instruments in the statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, a loss of and a gain of , respectively, related to the SBH Purchase Option was recognized as change in fair value of financial instruments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SBH Purchase Option represents a financial asset of and , respectively, within SBH purchase option and other derivative assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Management's Discussion Analysis of Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. 
 For purposes of this discussion, "Charlotte's Web," "CW," "we," "our", "us", or the "Company" refers to Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries: Charlotte's Web, Inc. and Abacus Products, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Abacus Health Products, Inc., Abacus Wellness, Inc. and CBD Pharmaceuticals Ltd. The results herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). 
 Amounts are presented in thousands of United States dollars, unless otherwise indicated. 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc., is a Certified B Corp headquartered in Louisville, Colorado, which conducts the majority of its business in the United States. The Company is a market leader in innovative hemp extract wellness products under a family of brands which includes Charlotte's Web , CBD Medic , and CBD Clinic . Charlotte's Web premium quality products start with proprietary hemp genetics that are 100 North American farm grown and are then manufactured into hemp extracts containing naturally occurring phytocannabinoids including Cannabidiol ("CBD"), cannabichromene ("CBC"), cannabigerol ("CBG"), terpenes, flavonoids and other cannabinoids and beneficial hemp compounds. The Company is headquartered in a cGMP compliant facility in Louisville, Colorado, where the Company conducts its production of tinctures, distribution, and quality control activities, as well as research and development ("R D"). Charlotte's Web product categories include full spectrum hemp extract oil tinctures (liquid products), gummies, capsules, CBD topical creams and lotions, broad spectrum botanical CBD, mushrooms, and pet products. The Company also offers NSF Certified for Sport broad spectrum tincture and gummy products. Charlotte's Web products are distributed to retailers and health care practitioners, and online through the Company's website at www.CharlottesWeb.com. The information provided on the website is not part of this MD A.

The Company's business consists of the farming, manufacturing, marketing, and sales of hemp-derived CBD and botanical wellness products. As of September 30, 2024, the Company operated in a single operating and reportable segment, hemp-derived CBD wellness products. The executive officers reviewed overall operating results in order to assess financial performance and to make resource allocation decisions, rather than to assess a lower-level unit of operations in isolation. 
 The Company's primary products are made from proprietary strains of whole-plant hemp extracts containing a full spectrum of phytocannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids and other hemp compounds. The Company believes the presence of these various compounds work synergistically to heighten the effects of the products, making them superior to single-compound isolates. 
 Hemp extracts are produced from Cannabis and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 on a dry weight basis. The Company is engaged in research involving a broad variety of compounds derived from hemp. Where research provides evidence that a greater than 0.3 THC level may have a potential therapeutic use, the Company may consider pursuing development of that use in jurisdictions where it is legal to do so in accordance with applicable regulations and if consistent with the Company's founding principles. The Company does not currently have any plans to expand into high THC products in the near future. 
 The Company grows its proprietary hemp domestically in the United States on farms leased in northeastern Colorado and sources hemp through contract farming operations in Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, and Canada. The hemp grown in Canada is utilized exclusively in the Canadian markets or for research purposes and not in the Company's products sold within the United States. 
 Recent Developments 
 With an increased commitment to innovation, Charlotte's Web has refreshed its mission to "Unearth the Science of Nature to Revolutionize Wellness," and is evolving its wellness offerings both to strengthen our core leadership in CBD, and extend beyond CBD to include a broader range of botanical wellness solutions, including minor cannabinoids. A testament to this expansion is the launch of Charlotte's Web Stay Asleep Cannabinol ("CBN") gummies. Similar to CBD, CBN is a non-intoxicating cannabinoid found in the hemp plant. At the cutting edge of innovative natural sleep solutions, these new melatonin free gummies could offer distinct benefits for the approximately 67 of adults who report waking up during the night (Phillips Global Sleep Survey, 2019). This is the first CBN sleep product supported by placebo-controlled peer-reviewed research study, offering a 20 mg dose of CBN. The Stay Asleep gummy demonstrates Charlotte's Web's commitment to science-backed products, providing an effective alternative to more traditional sleep supplements and medications. Charlotte's Web believes expanding beyond CBD leverages the Company's brand recognition, intellectual property, and partnerships, including an ongoing collaboration with DeFloria LLC ("DeFloria") for botanical drug development. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, Charlotte's Web unveiled a significant competitive price reduction of its leading CBD oils, without sacrificing its proprietary formulation or quality. This was accomplished by passing through improved operational efficiencies to consumers, with modest gross margin reduction expected to be offset with additional volume through the remainder of the year. More affordable pricing improves consumer accessibility, and broadens the total addressable consumer segments, attracting new consumers. 
 To better leverage its leading brand equity, the Company consolidated its CBD Medic and CBD Clinic brands under a unified Charlotte s Web brand architecture. Additionally, the Company's ReCreate brand has been absorbed under the recognized Charlotte s Web brand to better penetrate the lifestyles category. Charlotte s Web NSF Certified for Sport will benefit from the Company s valuable professional sports partnerships, including with the U.S. Premier Lacrosse League and Major League Baseball . 
 As of September 30, 2024 , several states have adopted new regulations that will impact the Company's ability to sell certain products as currently formulated or packaged in these states, including the emergency regulations enacted in September 2024 in the State of California. Many of these states have also implemented new THC/CBD limits, age verification, testing, labeling and packaging requirements. The Company continues to assess the business and financial impacts of the new regulations, including steps that can be taken to address the new product formulation, packaging, and labeling requirements, as well as costs and potential revenue impacts and anticipated timing for such impacts to the Company in these states. 
 The Company continues to invest in R D efforts to identify new product opportunities. The Company is working to capitalize on the rapidly emerging botanical wellness products industry by driving customer acquisition and retention, as well as accelerating retail expansion. In addition, the Company may consider expanding its product line beyond hemp-based products should the science and the Company's founding principles support such expansion.

On a quarter-over-quarter basis DTC net revenue increased 4.4 compared to the second quarter of 2024. 
 B2B net revenue decreased 10.7 year-over-year, primarily due to reductions or removals of shelf space allocations to CBD products by certain retailers over the past 12 months.

 Cost of goods sold increased 1.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, despite lower revenue compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 3.7 million increase in inventory provisions during the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to the revaluation on aged hemp based on current market conditions.

derivatives and options are revalued at each reporting date, with changes impacted by variability in the Company's share price and implied debt yields. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had total current liabilities of 16,483 and 23,646, respectively, and cash and cash equivalents of 24,620 and 47,820, respectively, to meet its current obligations. 
 As a result of expense reduction actions taken in 2024, the Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to be significantly lower compared to 2023. 
 The Company s ability to fund its operations for the next twelve months and thereafter will depend on its future operating performance, particularly prudent cost management, which can be affected by general economic conditions, industry regulatory changes, and other factors beyond the Company s control. 
 Management continually assesses liquidity in terms of the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund the business. Net cash flow is affected by the following items: (i) operating activities, including the cash impacts from the statements of operations, the level of accounts receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and unearned revenue and deposits; (ii) investing activities, including the purchase of property and equipment; and (iii) financing activities, including the issuance of capital shares. 
 The Company expects to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months through various sources of capital, including cash on hand and provided by operations over time. The Company regularly considers fundraising opportunities and may decide, from time to time, to raise capital through borrowings or issuances of additional equity and/or debt securities. The Company's ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including the state of the credit markets, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders, including restrictions on the industry. The Company's ability to raise funds through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt securities is also dependent on a number of factors including the current state of the capital markets, investor sentiment and intended use of proceeds. The Company's ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on, among other things, general market conditions for companies in the hemp industry and market perceptions about us. There can be no assurance the Company will have the ability to raise additional funds and, if those funds are raised privately or publicly, that such funds will be available to the Company when needed or on terms which are acceptable. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (19,469) (12,849) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 6,620 increase in cash used in operations were primarily due to the Company's collection of 4,261 from income tax refunds due during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the increase in cash used was due to decrease in sales and working capital, resulting in a decrease of net cash inflow. 
 Cash from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in investing activities (3,598) (2,896) 
 26 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by machinery purchases as part of the Company's plan to in-source topical and gummy production. 
 Cash from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in financing activities (133) (202) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change was primarily due to the vesting of restricted stock units. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results of operations or financial condition, including, and without limitation, such considerations as liquidity and capital resources. 
 Related party transactions 
 Effective November 2020, the Company issued a secured promissory note, where 1,000 was loaned to one of the Company's founders. The note receivable was secured by equity instruments with certain founders of the Company, bore interest at 3.25 per annum, and required the unpaid principal and unpaid interest balances to be paid on or before the maturity date of November 13, 2021. Effective November 13, 2024, the Company entered into a third amendment of the promissory note to extend the maturity date until November 13, 2029. According to the terms of the agreement, no additional interest will accrue through the payment date. The note has been fully reserved for as of December 31, 2023 . 
 On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into the SBH Purchase Option with Stanley Brothers USA as discussed above Note 3 "Fair Value Measurement"). The SBH Purchase Option was purchased for total consideration of 8,000 . Certain founder s of the Company, who are or were employees at the time, are the majority shareholders of Stanley Brothers USA. 
 On April 6, 2023, the Company jointly formed an entity, DeFloria, with AJNA and BAT. AJNA is a botanical drug development company. AJNA is partially owned and was co-founded by a co-founder of Charlotte's Web. BAT holds an equity interest in the entity in the form of 200,000 preferred units following its 10 million initial investment and has the right to participate in future equity issuances to maintain its pro rata equity position. The Company and AJNA each hold 400,000 of the entity's voting common units (Note 3). Effective May 1, 2023, the Company entered into an 8 interest bearing note receivable with DeFloria for the sale of lab equipment in the amount of 170 . The principal and interest of the note receivable will be paid in 36 monthly installments. As of September 30, 2024 , the remaining note receivable of 85, is presented in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In 2024, BAT and AJNA invested an additional 5 million and 2 million, respectively, in DeFloria in the form of convertible debt (refer to Note 3). Additionally, on February 12, 2024, the Company and DeFloria entered into a separate master services agreement pursuant to which the Company will be compensated for the provision of certain services to DeFloria. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 74 and 459, respectively, in revenue and cost of goods sold, respectively, related to the service agreement with DeFloria. Additionally, the Company has an accounts receivable balance due from DeFloria of 74, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 
 On June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Jared Stanley, Co-Founder of Charlotte's Web, former executive of the Company, and current member of the Board of Directors. The consulting agreement will remain in effect until June 13, 2025. In consideration for Mr. Stanley's services, he will receive a bi-weekly fee of 6.

Recently Adopted Accounting Principles 
 There are no new recent accounting pronouncements that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and adopted by the Company that had or may have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Policies and Accounting Estimates 
 Listed below are the accounting policies and estimates we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Please also refer to Note 2 of our notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements. 
 Fair Value Option 
 The Company has elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825-10 guidance to record its SBH Purchase Option. Under ASC 825-10, a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The SBH Purchase Option is classified as a financial asset in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes to fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the period. The use of assumptions for the fair value determination includes a high degree of subjectivity and judgment using unobservable inputs (level 3 on the fair value hierarchy), which results in estimation uncertainty. Changes in assumptions that reasonably could have been different at the reporting date may result in a higher or lower determination of fair value. The Monte Carlo valuation model considers multiple revenue and EBITDA outcomes for Stanley Brothers USA and other probabilities in assigning a fair value. Primary assumptions utilized include financial projections of Stanley Brothers USA and the probability and timing of exercise asserted by the Company. 
 Investment in Unconsolidated Entities 
 The Company has a variable interest in the investment in DeFloria; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of DeFloria as it lacks the power to direct DeFloria's key activities. The Company concluded that the investment in DeFloria should not be consolidated. In accordance with ASC 825-10, equity method investments are eligible for the fair value option as they represent recognized financial assets. As the Company was not required to consolidate the investment and does not meet any of the other scope exceptions, the Company had the ability to adopt the fair value option for the investment at inception. The investment was remeasured at fair value after each reporting date, with changes recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, as changes in fair value of financial instruments for the period. 
 The use of assumptions for the fair value determination of the investment in DeFloria included a high degree of subjectivity and judgment using unobservable inputs (level 3 on the fair value hierarchy), which results in estimation uncertainty. To determine the value of the investment, the Company utilizes an Option Pricing Model (OPM). The OPM considers the various terms of the stockholder agreements, including the level of seniority among the securities, dividend policy, conversion ratios, and cash allocations upon liquidation of the entity. The OPM is appropriate when the range of potential future outcomes is difficult to predict with any certainty. 
 Inventories 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable selling expenses. Cost includes all expenses for direct raw materials inputs, as well as costs directly attributable to the manufacturing process as well as suitable portions of related production overheads, based on normal operating capacity. Cost is determined by use of the weighted average method. To determine if a provision for inventories is required, the Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs or write-offs of inventory based on its assessment of market conditions, including forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand, as well as other factors such as potential excess or aged inventories based on product shelf life, and other factors that affect inventory obsolescence. The Company's inventories of harvested hemp are recorded at cost to grow and harvest. Raw materials costs as well as production costs are included in the carrying value of the Company's finished goods inventory. The Company's inventory production process for cannabinoid products includes cultivating of 
 28 

botanical raw material. Because of the duration of the cultivation process, a portion of the inventory will not be sold within one year. Consistent with the practice in other industries that cultivate botanical raw materials, all inventory is classified as a current asset. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The Company reviews intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually and reviews all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization, as well as indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than the Company had originally estimated. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset or asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate over their remaining lives. If the asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset or asset group. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, the Company amortizes the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. Impairment losses are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairment losses recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Convertible Debenture 
 The Company determined that the debenture is a freestanding financial instrument, which includes embedded derivatives. The embedded derivatives have been bifurcated from the debenture and accounted for separately in accordance with the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The Company reviewed the terms of the debenture and identified two material embedded features which required bifurcation and separate accounting pursuant to the provisions of ASC 815: 1) the interest rate conversion feature based on changes in federal regulations, and 2) the debt conversion option to common shares. The debt interest rate conversion feature is classified as a derivative asset and measured at fair value using a probability weighted income approach. The debt conversion option is classified as a derivative liability and measured at fair value using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company allocated proceeds first to the derivatives measured at fair value and the residual amount was allocated to the debenture. Debt issuance costs are allocated to the debenture. The debt issuance costs are presented as a direct reduction from the face value of the debenture and amortized over the stated term of the debenture. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal income tax rate in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period to period. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. The evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include projections of pre-tax book income for the foreseeable future, determination of cumulative pre-tax book income or loss, earnings history, and forecasting reliability. It is the Company's policy to offset indefinite lived deferred tax assets with indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities. The Company provided a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 The Company accounts for uncertainties in income taxes under ASC Topic 740, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement methodology to recognize and measure an income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. With respect to any tax positions that do not meet the recognition threshold, a corresponding liability, including interest and penalties, is recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may be subject to examination by tax authorities where the Company conducts operations. The earliest income tax year that may be subject to examination is 2019. The Company has recorded an uncertain tax position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties on taxes, if any, within the condensed consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense. 
 29 

Revenue Recognition 
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customer ("ASC 606"). The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under the standard, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of revenue accounting, the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue, the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. 
 The Company recognizes revenue from customers when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer, generally when products are shipped, at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. Freight revenue is included in revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and is generally exempt from state sales taxes. Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Contracts are written to include standard discounts and allowances. Contracts are not written to include advertising allowances, tiered discounts or any other performance obligation. Since the Company's contracts involve the delivery of various tangible products, the arrangements are considered to contain only a single performance obligation, as such there is no allocation of the transaction price. The Company also offers e-commerce discounts and promotions through its online rewards program. The Charlotte's Web Loyalty Program offers customers rewards points for every dollar spent through the Company website to earn store credit for future purchases. The Company defers recognition of revenue for unredeemed awards until the following occurs: (1) rewards are redeemed by the consumer, (2) points or certificates expire, or (3) an estimate of the expected unused portion of points or certificates is applied, which is based on historical redemption patterns. 
 Any product that does not meet the customer's expectations can be returned within the first 30 days of delivery in exchange for another product or for a full refund. Generally, any product sold through a distributor or retailer must be returned to the original purchase location for any return or exchange. The Company accounts for customer returns utilizing the "expected value method." Expected amounts are excluded from revenue and recorded as a "refund liability" that represents the Company's obligation to return the customer s consideration. Estimates are based on actual historical and current specific data. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The information under this item is not required to be provided by smaller reporting companies. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure the timely disclosure of required information in our SEC filings. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 30 

PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in various regulatory issues, claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. 
 At present, the Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business. Nor is the Company or its property the subject of any legal proceedings, known or contemplated, that involve a claim for damages exclusive of interest and costs that meet or exceed 10 of its current assets.
