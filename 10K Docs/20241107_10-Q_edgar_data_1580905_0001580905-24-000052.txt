 The vast majority of our sales originate from our reportable segment, Installation. Substantially all of our Installation segment sales are derived from the service-based installation of various products in the residential new construction, repair and remodel and commercial construction end markets from our national network of branch locations. Each of our Installation branches has the capacity to serve all of our end markets. See Note 3, Revenue Recognition, for information on our revenues by product and end market, and see Note 10, Information on Segments, for information on how we segment the business. 
 
 NOTE 2 - 
 We believe that the disclosures are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ), as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. The December 31, 2023 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements, but the related footnotes do not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. 
 Our interim operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future operating quarters. 
 Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements.

 The difference between contract assets and contract liabilities as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily the result of timing differences between our performance of obligations under contracts and customer payments and billings.

 We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if there is an impairment indicator. The accumulated impairment losses included within the above table were all associated with the Installation segment and substantially all of the impairment losses were recorded prior to the year ended December 31, 2010. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made the determination to wind down of our branches. The fair value of the impaired goodwill associated with this branch was not material.

 Term Loan Agreement Amendment 
 In March 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to our Term Loan Credit Agreement ("Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment amended certain terms of the existing term loan facility due December 2028, as amended (the "Term Loan Credit Agreement") and allowed for the issuance of a new term loan ("New Term Loan") in the amount of million which will mature on March 28, 2031. Net proceeds of the New Term Loan were used to refinance the remaining million on our existing term loan, pay fees and increase working capital. The New Term Loan does not have any financial maintenance covenants, eliminates the credit spread adjustment and the floor is reduced to . The New Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either: the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate plus per annum, or an alternative base rate plus . The New Term Loan also includes (i) a soft call protection provision during which a premium will be charged in connection with certain repricing transactions, and (ii) a basis points most favored nation protection for 12 months following the effective date. As of September 30, 2024, we had million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, due on our New Term Loan. We have various interest rates swaps that serve to hedge million of the variable cash flows on our New Term Loan through December 14, 2028. For further information about our interest rate swaps, see Note 11, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 
 We wrote off million and million in previously capitalized loan costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, we expensed million and million in loan costs that did not meet the requirements for capitalization during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of certain long-term debt, including the Term Loan and ABL Revolver as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximate fair value due to the variable rate nature of the agreements. The carrying amounts of our operating lease right-of-use assets and the obligations associated with our operating and finance leases as well as our vehicle and equipment notes approximate fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All debt classifications represent Level 2 fair value measurements. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value based on observable market information and appropriate valuation methods. 
 Contingent consideration liabilities arise from future earnout payments to the sellers associated with certain acquisitions and are based on predetermined calculations of certain future results. These future payments are estimated by considering various factors, including business risk and projections. The contingent consideration liabilities are measured at fair value by discounting estimated future payments, calculated based on a weighted average of various future forecast scenarios, to their net present value.

 operating segments consisting of Installation, Distribution and Manufacturing for the purpose of assessing business performance, managing the business and allocating resources. 
 Our Installation operating segment represents the majority of our net revenue and gross profit and forms our reportable segment. This operating segment represents the service-based installation of insulation and complementary building products in the residential new construction, repair and remodel and commercial construction end markets from our national network of branch locations. These branch locations have similar economic and operating characteristics including the nature of products and services offered, operating procedures and risks, customer bases, employee incentives, material procurement and shared corporate resources and therefore combine to form operating segment. 
 The Other category reported below reflects the operations of our remaining operating segments, Distribution and Manufacturing, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting. Our Distribution operating segment includes our businesses that sell insulation, gutters and accessories primarily to installers of these products who operate in multiple end markets. Our Manufacturing operating segment consists of our cellulose insulation manufacturing operation. In addition to sales of cellulose insulation, revenues from this operating segment consist of sales of asphalt and industrial fibers to distributors and installers of these products. 
 The Installation reportable segment includes substantially all of our net revenue from services while net revenue included in the Other category includes substantially all of our net revenue from sales of products. The intercompany sales from the Other category to the Installation reportable segment include a profit margin while our Installation segment records these transactions at cost. These transactions are shown in the Eliminations column in the tables below. 
 The key metrics used by our CODM to assess performance, manage the business and allocate resources of our operating segments are revenue and segment gross profit. We define segment gross profit as revenue less cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization. We do not report total assets, depreciation and amortization expenses included in reported cost of sales, operating expenses or other expense, net by segment because our CODM does not regularly receive or use this information.

Repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to approximately thousand shares of our common stock with an aggregate price of approximately million, or average price per share. The effect of these treasury shares in reducing the number of common shares outstanding is reflected in our earnings per share calculation. We did repurchase any common stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 On February 22, 2024, we announced that our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock. The new program replaces the previous program and is in effect through March 1, 2025.

 See Note 8, Leases, for further information regarding our lease commitments. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 From time to time, various claims and litigation are asserted or commenced against us principally arising from contractual matters and personnel and employment disputes. In determining loss contingencies, management considers the likelihood of loss as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of such loss or liability. An estimated loss is recorded when it is considered probable that such a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. As litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, we cannot be certain that we will prevail in these matters. However, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any pending matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 We have a supply agreement with variable pricing with of our suppliers to purchase a portion of the materials we utilize in our business. This agreement is effective March 31, 2023 through March 31, 2026 with a purchase obligation of million pounds for the period ending May 15, 2024, million pounds for the period ending March 31, 2025 and million pounds for the period ending March 31, 2026. Through September 30, 2024, we have purchased approximately million pounds of materials under the agreement period ending March 31, 2025. The agreement for the period ending May 15, 2024 has been satisfied as of September 30, 2024.

 Contingent consideration, non-compete agreements and/or amounts based on working capital calculations are included as seller obligations in the above table or within fair value of assets acquired if subsequently paid during the period presented. Contingent consideration payments consist primarily of earnouts based on performance that are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. When these payments are expected to be made over from the acquisition date, the contingent consideration is discounted to net present value of future payments based on a weighted average of various future forecast scenarios. 
 Further adjustments to the allocation for each acquisition still under its measurement period are expected as third-party or internal valuations are finalized, certain tax aspects of the transaction are completed and customary post-closing reviews are concluded during the measurement period attributable to each individual business combination. As a result, adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired, and in some cases total purchase price, have been made to certain business combinations since the date of acquisition and future adjustments may be made through the end of each measurement period. Any acquisition acquired after September 30, 2023 is deemed to be within the measurement period and its purchase price considered preliminary. 
 Goodwill and intangibles per the above table may not agree to the total gross increase of these assets as shown in Note 6, Goodwill and Intangibles, during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to adjustments to goodwill for the allocation of certain acquisitions still under measurement as well as intangible impairment charges and other immaterial intangible assets added during the ordinary course of business. One immaterial acquisition had its respective goodwill assigned to Other during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. All other acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 had their respective goodwill assigned to our Installation operating segment.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are one of the nation s largest insulation installers for the residential new construction market and are also a diversified installer of complementary building products throughout the United States, including waterproofing, fire-stopping and fireproofing, garage doors, rain gutters, window blinds, shower doors, closet shelving, mirrors and other products. We offer our portfolio of services for new and existing single-family and multi-family residential and commercial building projects in all 48 continental states and the District of Columbia from our national network of over 250 branch locations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 94 of our net revenue came from the service-based installation of these products across all of our end markets which forms our Installation operating segment and single reportable segment. In addition, two regional distribution operations serve the Midwest, Mountain West, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, and we operate a cellulose manufacturing facility. We believe our business is well positioned to continue to profitably grow over the long-term due to our strong balance sheet, liquidity and our continuing acquisition strategy. 
 A large portion of our net revenue comes from the U.S. residential new construction market, which depends upon a number of economic factors, including demographic trends, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, employment rates, housing inventory levels and affordability, foreclosure rates, the health of the economy and availability of mortgage financing. 
 2024 Third Quarter Highlights 
 Net revenue increased 7.7 , or 54.1 million to 760.6 million, while gross profit increased 6.1 to 256.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to the 8.8 increase in revenue of our largest end market, residential single-family new construction, 7.7 sales growth in the commercial end market, and also by recent acquisitions and selling price increases. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by sales growth in all end markets, selling price and product mix improvements and volume growth. The 2.7 increase in our price/mix metric for our Installation segment was primarily due to residential end market price growth. Net revenue grew faster than gross profit due to higher material and labor costs compared to the prior year. Certain net revenue and industry metrics we use to monitor our operations are discussed in the "Key Measures of Performance" section below, and further details regarding results of our various end markets are discussed further in the "Net Revenue, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit" section below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 406.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and we have not drawn on our revolving line of credit. This strong liquidity position allowed us to return capital to shareholders by increasing our regular quarterly dividend 6 over the second quarter of 2023 to 0.35 per share, or 9.8 million in the aggregate, and by repurchasing 20.7 million of our outstanding common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Key Measures of Performance 
 We utilize certain net revenue and industry metrics to monitor our operations. Key metrics include total sales growth and same branch growth metrics for our consolidated results, our Installation reportable segment and our Other category consisting of our Distribution and Manufacturing operating segments. We also monitor sales growth for our Installation segment by end market and track volume growth and price/mix growth. 
 We believe the revenue growth measures are important indicators of how our business is performing, however, we may rely on different metrics in the future. We also utilize gross profit percentage as shown in the following section to monitor our most significant variable costs and to evaluate labor efficiency and success at passing increasing costs of materials to customers.

 (7) Calculated based on period-over-period growth in our Other category which consists of our Manufacturing and Distribution operating segments. 
 (8) The heavy commercial end market, a subset of our total commercial end market, comprises projects that are much larger than our average installation job. This end market is excluded from the volume growth and price/mix growth calculations for our Installation segment as to not skew the growth rates given its much larger per-job revenue compared to the average jobs in our remaining end markets. 
 (9) Calculated as period-over-period change in the number of completed same-branch jobs within our Installation segment for all markets we serve except the heavy commercial end market. 
 (10) Defined as change in the mix of products sold and related pricing changes and calculated as the change in period-over-period average selling price per same-branch jobs within our Installation segment for all markets we serve except the heavy commercial market, multiplied by total current year jobs. The mix of end customer and product would have an impact on the year-over-year price per job.

Net Revenue, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
 The components of gross profit were as follows (in millions): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 Net revenue 760.6 7.7 706.5 2,191.1 6.5 2,057.9 Cost of sales 503.8 8.5 464.4 1,448.4 5.5 1,372.9 Gross profit 256.8 6.1 242.1 742.7 8.4 685.0 Gross profit percentage 33.8 34.3 33.9 33.3 
 Net revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period in 2023 as we increased same branch sales in all our end markets combined with revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. Same branch sales growth from the residential end markets increased 5.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the same period ended September 30, 2023. Installation selling price and product mix improvements also increased 2.7 with same branch sales volume increase of 2.6 . Multi-family same branch sales remained beneficial with period-over-period growth of 2.4 . Lastly, the Distribution operating segment, combined with our Manufacturing operating segment, further supported net revenue growth as it experienced 9.1 growth during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit improved during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily on the strength of price/mix growth. Gross profit grew slower than net revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher material and labor costs driven by changes in product and customer mix. We will continue to work with our suppliers to lessen the impact on our margins and with our customers to offset further cost increases through selling price adjustments. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses were as follows (in millions): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 Selling 35.8 11.9 32.0 103.6 6.3 97.5 Percentage of total net revenue 4.7 4.5 4.7 4.7 Administrative 109.2 12.8 96.8 318.5 12.8 282.3 Percentage of total net revenue 14.4 13.7 14.5 13.7 Asset impairment 4.9 100.0 Percentage of total net revenue 0.2 Amortization 10.5 (4.5) 11.0 31.7 (5.9) 33.7 Percentage of total net revenue 1.4 1.6 1.4 1.6 
 Selling 
 The dollar increase in selling expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in selling compensation and commissions to support our increased net revenue. Selling expense as a percentage of sales increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 due to increased compensation from changes in product mix. Selling expense as a percentage of sales remains flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Administrative 
 The dollar increase in administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in wages and benefits, which was attributable to both acquisitions and organic growth as well as favorable company performance. Facility and insurance cost increases due to inflationary pressures also factored into the overall increase in administrative operating expenses. Administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher salaries and bonuses due to higher profitability.

Asset Impairment 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we elected to wind down the operations of a branch that installs one of our non-core building products. As a result, we deemed it necessary to perform an interim assessment of tangible and intangible assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an intangible impairment charge of 4.6 million related to definite-lived customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames and covenants not-to-compete within our Installation segment. In addition, we recognized an asset impairment charge of 0.3 million related to property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets within our Installation segment. We did not recognize any impairment losses on our tangible or intangible assets during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Amortization 
 Amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 decreased primarily due to the acquisition of fewer finite-lived intangible assets. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net was as follows (in millions): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 
 Interest expense, net 7.7 (20.6) 9.7 27.8 (4.8) 29.2 Other (income) (0.3) 50.0 (0.2) (0.8) 60.0 (0.5) Total other expense, net 7.4 9.5 27.0 28.7 
 The decline in interest expense, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to increased interest income on various bank accounts, partially offset by decreased interest expense associated with term loan refinancing costs. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Income tax provision and effective tax rates were as follows (in millions): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 
 Income tax provision 25.3 24.8 67.3 63.9 Effective tax rate 26.9 26.7 26.2 26.3 
 The effective tax rate for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were unfavorably impacted by certain expenses not being deductible for income tax reporting purposes. The effective tax rate for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were favorably impacted by recognition of a windfall tax benefit from equity vesting. 
 Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income, Net of Tax 
 Other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax was as follows (in millions): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net change on cash flow hedges, net of taxes (10.6) 5.5 (5.9) 4.6 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded unrealized losses of 11.4 million and 8.3 million, net of taxes, respectively, on our cash flow hedges due to the changes in the market's expectations for future long-term interest rates relative to our three active interest rate swaps and our two forward interest rate swaps. We also amortized 1.1 million and 3.3 million of our remaining unrealized gains and losses, net, on our terminated cash flow hedges to interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, not including the offsetting tax effects of 0.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded unrealized gains of 4.7 million and 2.1 million, net of taxes, respectively, on our cash flow hedges due to the changes in market's expectations for future long-term interest rates

relative to our three existing interest rate swaps and our two forward interest rate swaps. We also amortized 1.1 million and 3.3 million of our remaining unrealized gains and losses, net, on our terminated cash flow hedges to interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, not including the offsetting tax effects of 0.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively. 
 
 KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATING RESULTS 
 Inflation, Housing Affordability and Interest Rates 
 Inflation that affected the economy as a whole in 2022 began moderating in 2023 as the Federal Reserve took actions to stabilize inflation by raising the federal funds rate multiple times through July 2023. These rate hikes indirectly raised the 30-year fixed rate mortgage average in the United States to over 7 for the first time since 2008 during periods of 2023 and 2024. These rate-driven pressures began to curtail housing demand beginning in the second half of 2022 as mortgage financing affordability was reduced. Inflation rates in 2024 have remained above the 2 stated target, however the Federal Reserve implemented a 50 basis point cut in September 2024. The Federal Reserve has signaled plans to lower rates further during the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. While a more accommodating Federal Reserve monetary policy does not directly determine mortgage rates, the expected easing likely will contribute to a downward trend in mortgage rates in the near term. We expect to be somewhat impacted by the current elevated rates for the remainder of 2024 but anticipate pressures to lessen over time if mortgage rates are further reduced in the coming months. 
 Trends in the Construction Industry 
 Activity in the residential homebuilding market remains resilient as non-seasonally adjusted single-family starts, our largest end market, increased 10.1 per the U.S. Census Bureau for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, stable employment and near historic lows in existing home inventory levels continue to support demand for residential new construction activity despite the affordability concerns. As a result, while we expect cyclicality to continue in the housing industry, we believe the long-term opportunities in our residential and commercial end markets are favorable. Our largest customers are publicly traded homebuilders, and these builders have been able to increase affordability by offering mortgage rate buydowns as incentives to their customers. Regarding the repair and remodel markets, many existing homeowners are locked into low interest mortgages and an aging housing stock exists in many areas of the United States. We expect these two factors, combined with incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, to drive growth in the repair and remodel markets we service. 
 Cost and Availability of Materials 
 We typically purchase the materials we use in our business directly from manufacturers. The industry supply of these materials has experienced multiple periods of supply shortages since 2020 due to strong demand and effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to meet customer demand during these shortages, we have purchased a limited amount of materials from distributors and home centers at a premium to what we typically would purchase directly from manufacturers, therefore reducing gross profit. The supply chain issues for some of the products we install have moderated, however, we expect these challenges to persist to a nominal degree throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025. 
 In addition, we experience price increases due to supply shortages and general economic inflationary pressures from our suppliers from time to time, and we anticipate that we will experience additional price increases in 2024. Increased market pricing, regardless of the catalyst, has and could continue to impact our results of operations in 2024, to the extent that price increases cannot be passed on to our customers. Our selling price increases were able to support most material cost increases in 2023 and the first three quarters of 2024, but we may have more difficulty raising prices throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 if housing demand slows. We will continue to work with our customers to adjust selling prices to offset higher costs as they occur. 
 Cost of Labor 
 Our business is labor intensive and the majority of our employees work as installers on local construction sites. We expect to continue to spend more to hire, train and retain installers to support our growing business, as tight labor availability continues within the construction industry. Our workers compensation costs also continue to rise as we increase our coverage for additional personnel. Inflation and market competition caused our labor costs as a percentage of revenue to increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 32 

Our employee retention rates remained better than industry averages in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe this is a result of our strong culture and the various programs meant to benefit our employees, including our financial wellness plan, emotional well-being coaching, longevity stock compensation plan and comprehensive benefit packages we offer. We also provide assistance from the Installed Building Products Foundation meant to benefit our employees, their families and their communities. While improved retention drives lower costs to recruit and train new employees, resulting in greater installer productivity, these improvements are somewhat offset by the additional costs of these incentives. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our capital resources primarily consist of cash from operations and borrowings under our various debt agreements and capital equipment leases and loans. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 406.2 million as well as access to 250.0 million under our asset-based lending credit facility (as defined below), less 5.8 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in total liquidity of 650.4 million. Liquidity may also be limited in the future by certain cash collateral limitations under our asset-based credit facility (as defined below), depending on the status of our borrowing base availability. 
 Short-Term Material Cash Requirements 
 Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, operating expenses, acquisitions and capital expenditures, to meet debt and leasing principal and interest obligations and to make required income tax payments. We may also use our resources to fund our optional stock repurchase program and pay quarterly and annual dividends. We expect to spend cash and cash equivalents to acquire various companies with at least 100.0 million in aggregate net revenue each fiscal year. The amount of cash paid for an acquisition is dependent on various factors, including the size and determined value of the business being acquired. 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through net cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings from various lenders under equipment and loan agreements. Additional sources of funds, should we need them, include borrowing capacity under our asset-based lending credit facility (as defined below). 
 We believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to support our ongoing operations and to fund our business needs, commitments and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months as evidenced by our net positive cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe that we have access to additional funds, if needed, through the capital markets to obtain further debt financing under the current market conditions, but we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In the short-term, we expect the seasonal trends we typically experience to return, including higher sales in the spring, summer and fall than in the winter. This could affect the timing of cash collections and payments during the rest of 2024 and into 2025. 
 Long-Term Material Cash Requirements 
 Beyond the next twelve months, our principal demands for funds will be to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, to meet principal and interest obligations on our long-term debts and finance leases as they become due or mature, and to make required income tax payments. Additional funds may be spent on acquisitions, capital improvements and dividend payments, at our discretion. 
 On a long-term basis, we may refinance existing debt or obtain further debt financing to the extent that our sources of capital are insufficient to meet our operating needs and/or growth strategy. 
 In "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our 2023 Form 10-K, we disclosed that we had 1.1 billion aggregate long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023. In addition to these commitments, we have a long-term commitment to purchase 43.7 million pounds of material with variable pricing through March 2026. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on this commitment. Additionally, we extended our term loan via a refinancing during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which will extend the maturity date by more than 2 years and require an additional 10.0 million in principal payments. There were no other material changes to our cash requirements during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q outside of the normal course of our business.

Sources and Uses of Cash and Related Trends 
 Working Capital 
 We carefully manage our working capital and operating expenses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our working capital including cash and cash equivalents was 748.1 million and 723.6 million, respectively. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to additional accounts receivable of 27.7 million resulting from higher year-over-year net revenue and increased inventory of 19.5 million as a result of higher warehoused material levels due to consolidated sales growth. Cash also increased 19.7 million stemming from the 265.2 million of cash earned from operations , partially offset by the payment of our annual and quarterly dividends, acquisition activity, purchases of capital equipment, and repurchases of common stock. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in millions): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 265.2 250.5 Net cash used in investing activities (94.4) (77.9) Net cash used in financing activities (151.1) (62.4) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our primary source of cash provided by operations is revenues generated from installing or selling building products and the resulting operating income generated by these revenues. Operating income is adjusted for certain non-cash items, and our cash flows from operations can be impacted by the timing of our cash collections on sales and collection of retainage amounts. 
 Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments for installation materials, compensation costs, leases, income taxes and other general corporate expenditures included in net income. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to the increases in net income, changes in certain working capital requirements and various non-cash adjustments, partially offset by increases of our accounts receivable and inventory balances. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Sources of cash from investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment, settlements with interest rate swap counterparties and, periodically, maturities from short term investments. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of property and equipment, payments for acquisitions and, periodically, purchases of short term investments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to more spending on purchases of property and equipment to support our growing business during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the decrease in spending on acquisitions of businesses in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Our sources of cash from financing activities consist of proceeds from the issuances of vehicle and equipment notes payable and, periodically, other sources of debt financing. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of debt repayments, acquisition-related obligations, dividends and stock repurchases. 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to dividends paid and repurchases of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was partially offset by net proceeds from the New Term Loan. See Note 12, Stockholders' Equity, for more information on the dividends paid and stock repurchases.

Debt 
 5.75 Senior Notes due 2028 
 In September 2019, we issued 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75 senior unsecured notes (the Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes will mature on February 1, 2028 and interest is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on February 1, 2020. The net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering were 295.0 million after debt issuance costs. 
 The indenture covering the Senior Notes contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and certain of our subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) to: (i) incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock in an aggregate amount exceeding 2.0 of market capitalization per fiscal year, or in an aggregate amount exceeding certain applicable restricted payment baskets; (iii) prepay subordinated debt; (iv) create liens; (v) make specified types of investments; (vi) apply net proceeds from certain asset sales; (vii) engage in transactions with affiliates; (viii) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets; and (ix) pay dividends and make other distributions from subsidiaries. 
 Credit Facilities 
 Term Loan Facility 
 In December 2021, we amended our previous 500 million, seven-year term loan facility due December 2028 under our credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement ), dated as of December 14, 2021 with Royal Bank of Canada as the administrative agent and collateral agent thereunder. 
 In April 2023, we notified the lenders on our previous term loan under our Term Loan Agreement that we elected to trigger a benchmark replacement from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR"). The previous term loan was subsequently amended on April 28, 2023 (the "First Amendment") to implement Term SOFR as the benchmark rate and includes a credit spread adjustment of 0.11 , 0.26 and 0.43 for interest periods of one month, three months and six months, respectively, and it is subject to the same floor as currently set forth in the Term Loan Agreement. 
 In August 2023, we amended and restated our previous term loan (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment effects a repricing of the interest rate applicable to the existing term loans thereunder from Term SOFR plus 2.25 to Term SOFR plus 2.00 . The Second Amendment also establishes an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00 , (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Term SOFR rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 . The Second Amendment also states that there will be a six-month protection provision during which a 1.00 premium would be charged in connection with certain repricing transactions. 
 In March 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to our Term Loan Credit Agreement ("Third Amendment"). The Third Amendment amended certain terms of the existing Term Loan Credit Agreement and allowed for the issuance of a new term loan ("New Term Loan") in the amount of 500.0 million which will mature on March 28, 2031. Net proceeds of the New Term Loan were used to refinance the remaining 490.0 million on our previous term loan, pay fees and increase working capital. The New Term Loan does not have any financial maintenance covenants, eliminates the credit spread adjustment and the floor is reduced to 0.00 . The New Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either: Term SOFR plus 2.00 per annum, or an alternative base rate plus 1.00 . The New Term Loan also includes (i) a six-month soft call protection provision during which a 1.00 premium will be charged in connection with certain repricing transactions, and (ii) a 50 basis points most favored nation protection for 12 months following the effective date. The New Term Loan amortizes in quarterly principal payments of 1.25 million starting on June 30, 2024, with any remaining unpaid balances due on the maturity date of March 28, 2031. As of September 30, 2024, we had 493.2 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, due on our New Term Loan. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, the New Term Loan will be subject to mandatory prepayments of (i) 100 of the net cash proceeds from issuances or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries (other than with respect to certain permitted indebtedness (excluding any refinancing indebtedness); (ii) 100 (with step-downs to 50 and 0 based on achievement of specified net leverage ratios) of the net cash proceeds from certain sales or dispositions of assets by the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount and subject to reinvestment provision and certain other exception; and (iii) 50 (with step-downs to 25 and 0 based upon achievement of specified net leverage ratios) of excess cash flow of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries in excess of 15.0 million, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. 
 
 35 

Asset-based Lending Credit Agreement 
 In February 2022, we amended and extended the term of our asset-based lending credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement ). The ABL Credit Agreement increased the commitment under the asset-based lending credit facility (the ABL Revolver to 250.0 million from 200.0 million, and permits us to further increase the commitment amount up to 300.0 million. The amendment also extends the maturity date from September 26, 2024 to February 17, 2027. The ABL Revolver bears interest at either the base rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR"), at our election, plus a margin of 0.25 or 0.50 in the case of base rate loans or 1.25 or 1.50 for Term SOFR advances (in each case based on a measure of availability under the ABL Credit Agreement). The amendment also allows for modification of specified fees dependent upon achieving certain sustainability targets, in addition to making other modifications to the ABL Credit Agreement. In connection with the Term Loan Agreement, we entered into a third amendment to the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as ABL Agent for the lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement, and Royal Bank of Canada as collateral agent under the Term Loan Agreement. Including outstanding letters of credit, our remaining availability under the ABL Revolver as of September 30, 2024 was 244.2 million. 
 All of the obligations under the New Term Loan and ABL Revolver are guaranteed by all of the Company s existing restricted subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by the Company s future restricted subsidiaries. Additionally, all obligations under the New Term Loan and ABL Revolver, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in such assets that constitute ABL Priority Collateral, as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement, and a second- priority security interest in such assets that constitute Term Loan Priority Collateral, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement. 
 The ABL Revolver also provides incremental revolving credit facility commitments of up to 50.0 million. The terms and conditions of any incremental revolving credit facility commitments must be no more favorable than the terms of the ABL Revolver. The ABL Revolver also allows for the issuance of letters of credit of up to 100.0 million in aggregate and borrowing of swingline loans of up to 25.0 million in aggregate. 
 The ABL Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring the satisfaction of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0x in the event that we do not meet a minimum measure of availability under the ABL Revolver. The ABL Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and certain of our subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) to: (i) incur additional debt and issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock in an aggregate amount exceeding the greater of 2.0 of market capitalization per fiscal year or certain applicable restricted payment basket amounts; (iii) prepay subordinated debt; (iv) create liens; (v) make specified types of investments; (vi) apply net proceeds from certain asset sales; (vii) engage in transactions with affiliates; (viii) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets; and (ix) pay dividends and make other distributions from subsidiaries. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Term Loan Agreement, ABL Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had three active interest rate swaps with maturity dates of December 31, 2025 and two forward interest rate swaps with maturity dates of December 14, 2028. When combined, these five swaps serve to hedge 400.0 million of the variable cash flows on our Term Loan through December 14, 2028. For further information about our interest rate swaps, see Note 11, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. The assets associated with the interest rate swaps are included in current assets and other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value amounts as described in Note 9, Fair Value Measurements. 
 Vehicle and Equipment Notes 
 We are party to a Master Loan and Security Agreement Master Loan and Security Agreement ), a Master Equipment Lease Agreement Master Equipment Agreement and one or more Master Loan Agreements Master Loan Agreements and together with the Master Loan and Security Agreement and Master Equipment Agreement, the Master Loan and Equipment Agreements with various lenders to provide financing for the purpose of purchasing or leasing vehicles and equipment used in the normal course of business. Vehicles and equipment purchased or leased under each financing arrangement serve as collateral for the note applicable to such financing arrangement. Regular payments are due under each note for a period of typically 60 consecutive months after the incurrence of the obligation. 
 
 36 

Total outstanding loan balances relating to our Master Loan and Equipment Agreements were 79.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 83.0 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Depreciation of assets held under these agreements is included within cost of sales on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
 Letters of Credit and Bonds 
 We may use performance bonds to ensure completion of our work on certain larger customer contracts that can span multiple accounting periods. Performance bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. In addition, we occasionally use letters of credit and cash to secure our performance under our general liability, workers compensation and auto insurance programs. Permit and license bonds are typically issued for one year and are required by certain states and municipalities when we obtain licenses and permits to perform work in their jurisdictions. 
 The following table summarizes our outstanding bonds, letters of credit and cash-collateral (in millions): 
 As of September 30, 2024 Performance bonds 79.1 Insurance letters of credit and cash collateral 71.2 Permit and license bonds 11.1 Total bonds and letters of credit 161.4 
 We have 62.9 million included in our insurance letters of credit in the above table that are unsecured and therefore do not reduce total liquidity. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported using different assumptions or under different conditions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a description of recently issued and/or adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including with respect to the housing market and the commercial market, our operations, economic and industry conditions, our financial and business model, payments of dividends, the demand for our services and product offerings, trends in the commercial business, expansion of our national footprint and diversification, our ability to grow and strengthen our market position, our ability to pursue and integrate value-enhancing acquisitions, our ability to improve sales and profitability, our efforts to navigate the material pricing environment, our ability to increase selling prices, our material and labor costs, supply chain and material constraints and expectations for demand for our services and our earnings in 2024 and 2025. Forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, project, predict, possible, forecast, may, could, would, should, expect, intends, plan, and will or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not 
 
 37 

historical facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Any forward-looking statements that we make herein and in any future reports and statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation the general economic and industry conditions; increases in mortgage interest rates and rising home prices; inflation and interest rates; the material price and supply environment; the timing of increases in our selling prices; the risk that the Company may reduce, suspend or eliminate dividend payments in the future; and the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Form 10-K, as the same may be updated from time to time in our subsequent filings with the SEC. In addition, any future declaration of dividends will be subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this report speaks only as of the date hereof. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time and it is impossible for the Company to predict these events or how they may affect it. The Company has no obligation, and does not intend, to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 497.5 million outstanding on our Term Loan, gross of unamortized debt issuance costs, no outstanding borrowings on our ABL Revolver and no outstanding borrowings under finance leases subject to variable interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had three active and two forward interest rate swaps which, when combined, serve to hedge 400.0 million of the variable cash flows on our Term Loan until its maturity unless extended. As a result, total variable rate debt of 97.5 million was exposed to market risks as of September 30, 2024. A hypothetical one percentage point increase (decrease) in interest rates on our variable rate debt would increase (decrease) our annual interest expense by approximately 1.0 million. Our Senior Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 5.75 . 
 For variable rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We have not entered into and currently do not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO as required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
