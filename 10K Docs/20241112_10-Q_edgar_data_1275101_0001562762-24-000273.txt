 (1) Weighted based on the relative value of the instruments Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Collateral Dependent Loans with an ACLL In accordance with ASC 326 , the Company may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate it from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry, among other things. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management s assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The Company reevaluates the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on a quarterly basis. The fair value of real estate collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated by appraisal services using a methodology that is consistent with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. Because we had no collateral dependent loans with an ACLL, nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded on these loans during the period ended September 30, 2024. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale are carried at cost which approximates estimated fair value. These loans currently consist of one-to-four family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level 2). As such, the Company records fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded on loans held for sale during the period ended September 30, 2024. Gains and losses on the sale of loans are recorded within gain on sales of loans held for sale on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other Real Estate Owned Certain assets such as other real estate owned (OREO) are measured at fair value less cost to sell. The Company believes that the fair value component in its valuation follows the provisions of ASC 820.

OREO as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Because we did not have OREO, nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded for OREO during the period ended September 30, 2024. Financial Instruments FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not required to be measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are presented in the following tables whether or not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned securities in an unrealized loss position. Of the securities, were S P rated AAA, were rated AA, were rated A, were rated BBB, and were non-rated. As of September 30, 2024, of these securities were municipal issues, were backed directly or indirectly by the U.S. government, and were issues of publicly traded domestic corporations. The Company monitors its municipal and corporate securities by periodically reviewing the issuer s cash-flow and revenue streams, as well as other economic factors that could affect the issuer s ability to service and/or repay the debt. The Company has evaluated available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position for credit related impairment at September 30, 2024 and concluded impairment existed based on a combination of factors, which included: (1) the securities are of high credit quality (2) unrealized losses are primarily the result of market volatility and increases in market interest rates, (3) the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuers to settle the securities at a price less than the par value of each investment, (4) issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and (5) the Company does not intend to sell any of the investments before recovery of its amortized cost basis, nor is it likely that management will be required to sell the securities. As such, there was t an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2024. The Company s held-to-maturity portfolio is covered by the explicit or implied guarantee of the United States government or one of its agencies and rated investment grade or higher. As a result, the Company did t have an allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. All held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities were current with securities past due or on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2024.

 reportable business segments: (i) a traditional full-service community banking segment, (ii) a mortgage loan origination business, and (iii) a registered investment advisory business (sometimes referred to as the wealth management business). The community banking business segment includes Bank of the James which provides loans, deposits, investments and insurance to retail and commercial customers throughout Region 2000 and other areas within Central Virginia. The mortgage segment provides a variety of mortgage loan products principally within Region 2000. Mortgage loans are originated and sold in the secondary market through purchase commitments from investors with servicing released. Because of the pre-arranged purchase commitments, there is minimal risk to the Company. The investment advisory business offers investment advisory services through Financial s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pettyjohn, Wood White, Inc. All of the Company s reportable segments are service-based. The mortgage business is a gain on sale business and the investment advisory business is fee for service based, while the Bank s primary source of revenue is net interest income. The Bank also provides a referral network for the mortgage origination business and the investment advisory business. The mortgage business may also be in a position to refer its customers to the Bank for banking services when appropriate. Information about reportable business segments and reconciliation of such information to the consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (dollars in thousands):

segments - residential mortgage loans and personal loans. We include HELOCs and other second mortgages in in our consumer loan segment. Home equity loans are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4 family residences, and consumer personal loans are secured by consumer personal assets, such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer personal loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. For residential mortgage loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner-occupied, the Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas, such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in property values on residential properties. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.

Note 8 Loans and allowance for credit losses (continued) Credit Quality Indicators The Bank s internal risk rating system is in place to grade commercial and commercial real estate loans. Category ratings are reviewed periodically by lenders and the credit review area of the Bank based on the borrower s individual situation. Additionally, internal and external monitoring and review of credits are conducted on an annual basis. Below is a summary and definition of the Bank s risk rating categories: RATING 1 Excellent RATING 2 Above Average RATING 3 Satisfactory RATING 4 Acceptable / Low Satisfactory RATING 5 Monitor RATING 6 Special Mention RATING 7 Substandard RATING 8 Doubtful RATING 9 Loss 
 We segregate loans into the above categories based on the following criteria and we review the characteristics of each rating at least annually, generally during the first quarter. The characteristics of these ratings are as follows: Pass. These are loans having risk ratings of 1 through 4. Pass loans are to persons or business entities with an acceptable financial condition, appropriate collateral margins, appropriate cash flow to service the existing loan, and an appropriate leverage ratio. The borrower has paid all obligations as agreed and it is expected that this type of payment history will continue. When necessary, acceptable personal guarantors support the loan. Monitor. These are loans having a risk rating of 5. Monitor loans have currently acceptable risk but may have the potential for a specific defined weakness in the borrower s operations and the borrower s ability to generate positive cash flow on a sustained basis. The borrower s recent payment history may currently or in the future be characterized by late payments. The Bank s risk exposure is mitigated by collateral supporting the loan. The collateral is considered to be well-margined, well maintained, accessible and readily marketable. Special Mention. These are loans having a risk rating of 6. Special Mention loans have weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the bank s credit position at some future date. Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. These loans do warrant more than routine monitoring due to a weakness caused by adverse events. Substandard. These are loans having a risk rating of 7. Substandard loans are considered to have specific and well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the viability of the Bank s credit extension. The payment history for the loan has been inconsistent and the expected or projected primary repayment source may be inadequate to service the loan. The estimated net liquidation value of the collateral pledged and/or ability of the personal guarantor(s) to pay the loan may not adequately protect the Bank. There is a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected in the near term. A substandard loan would not automatically meet our definition of impaired unless the loan is significantly past due and the borrower s performance and financial condition provides evidence that it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due. Doubtful. These are loans having a risk rating of 8. Doubtful rated loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan that is classified substandard but with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high. Loss. These are loans having a risk rating of 9. Loss rated loans are not considered collectible under normal circumstances and there is no realistic expectation for any future payment on the loan. Loss rated loans are fully charged off.

loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, no previously modified loans have defaulted in the last twelve months. ACL on Unfunded Commitments The Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit, commitments to extend future credit, as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for (or recovery of) credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the allowance for loan credit losses. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments of at September 30, 2024, is separately classified within Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table presents the balance and activity in the ACL for unfunded commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Recovery of credit losses Balance September 30, 2024 Balance, December 31, 2023 Recovery of credit losses Balance September 30, 2024 Balance, June 30, 2023 Recovery of credit losses Balance September 30, 2023 Balance, December 31, 2022 - Adoption of ASU 2016-13 Recovery of credit losses Balance September 30, 2023

GENERAL Critical Accounting Policies Bank of the James Financial Group, Inc. s Financial or the Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in th e United States (GAAP). The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change. The allowance for credit losses (ACLL) is management s estimate of the probable losses expected in our loan portfolio and held-to-maturity securities portfolio. With the exception of loans related to agriculture, the Company is utilizing a discounted cash flow model to estimate its current expected credit losses in our loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in estimating risk. For information on the Company's policies on the ACLL please refer to Note 2 Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Management Discussion and Analysis Results of Operations Allowance and Provision for Credit losses below for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses. Goodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected September 1 of each year as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Impairment testing requires a qualitative assessment or that the fair value of each of the Company s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of their net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill to record an impairment loss. Determining fair value is subjective, requiring the use of estimates, assumptions and management judgment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, if any. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our consolidated balance sheet. Overview Financial is a bank holding company headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. Our primary business is retail banking which we conduct through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank of the James (which we refer to as the Bank ). We conduct four other business activities: mortgage banking through the Bank s Mortgage Division (which we refer to as Mortgage ), investment services through the Bank s Investment division (which we refer to as Investment Division ), insurance activities through BOTJ Insurance, Inc., a subsidiary of the Bank, (which we refer to as Insurance business ), and as of December 31, 2021, investment advisory services through the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pettyjohn, Wood White, Inc. (which we refer to as PWW ). The Bank is a Virginia banking corporation headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The Bank was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as a state-chartered bank in 1998 and began banking operations in July 1999. The Bank was organized to engage in general retail and commercial banking business. The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution that provides varied banking services to individuals, small and medium-sized businesses, and professional concerns. Historically, our primary market area has been the Central Virginia, Region 2000 area, which encompasses the seven jurisdictions of the Town of Altavista, Amherst County, Appomattox County, the Town of Bedford, Bedford County, Campbell County, and the City of Lynchburg. Recently, the Bank has begun to expand to other areas in Virginia, specifically Roanoke, Charlottesville, Harrisonburg, Blacksburg, Lexington and Rustburg. The Bank strives to provide its customers with products comparable to statewide regional banks located in its market area, while maintaining the prompt response time and level of service of a community bank. Management believes this operating strategy has particular appeal in the Bank s market areas. We conduct our investment advisory business through PWW, which Financial acquired on December 31, 2021. PWW is a Lynchburg, Virginia-based investment advisory firm that has approximately 789 million in assets under management and advisement as of September 30, 2024. PWW generates revenue primarily through investment advisory fees. The Bank s principal office is located at 828 Main Street, Lynchburg, Virginia 24504 and its telephone number is (434) 846-2000. The Bank also maintains a website at www.bankofthejames.bank.

Our operating results depend primarily upon the Bank s net interest income, which is determined by the difference between (i) interest and dividend income on earning assets, which consist primarily of loans, investment securities and other investments, and (ii) interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, which consist principally of deposits and other borrowings. The Bank s net income also is affected by its provision for credit losses, as well as the level of its noninterest income, including gains on sales of loans held for sale and service charges, and investment advisory fees, and its noninterest expenses, including salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, data processing expenses, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums, expense in complying with regulatory requirements, miscellaneous other expenses, franchise taxes, and income taxes. The Bank intends to enhance its profitability by increasing its market share in our service areas, providing additional services to its customers, and controlling costs. The Bank services its banking customers through the following locations in Virginia: Full-Service Branches The main office located at 828 Main Street in Lynchburg, Virginia (the Main Street Office ), A branch located at 5204 Fort Avenue in Lynchburg, Virginia (the Fort Avenue Branch ), A branch located at 4935 Boonsboro Road, Suites C and D in Lynchburg, Virginia (the Boonsboro Branch ), A branch located at 4105 Boonsboro Road in Lynchburg, Virginia (the Peakland Branch ), A branch located at 4698 South Amherst Highway in Amherst County, Virginia (the Madison Heights Branch ), A branch located at 17000 Forest Road in Forest, Virginia (the Forest Branch ), A branch located at 164 South Main Street, Amherst, Virginia (the Amherst Branch ), A branch located at 1405 Ole Dominion Boulevard in the Town of Bedford, Virginia, located off of Independence Boulevard (the Bedford Branch ), A branch located at 1110 Main Street, Altavista, Virginia (the Altavista Branch ), A branch located at 1391 South High Street, Harrisonburg, Virginia (the Harrisonburg Branch ), A branch located at 1745 Confederate Blvd, Appomattox, Virginia (the Appomattox Branch ), A branch located at 225 Merchant Walk Avenue, Charlottesville, Virginia (the 5th Street Station Branch ), A branch located at 3562 Electric Road, Roanoke, Virginia (the Roanoke Branch ), A branch located at 45 South Main St., Lexington, Virginia (the Lexington Branch ), A branch located at 550 Water St., Charlottesville, Virginia (the Water Street Branch ), A branch located at 2101 Electric Rd, Roanoke, Virginia (the Oak Grove Branch ), A branch l ocated at 13 Village Highway, Rustburg, Virginia (the Rustburg Branch ), A branch located at 19792 Main Street, Buchanan, Virginia (the Buchanan Branch and A temporary branch located at 2773 Rockfish Valley Highway, Nellysford, Virginia (the Temporary Nellysford Branch ).

Subject to regulatory approval, the Bank may open additional branches during the next two fiscal years. Although numerous factors could influence the Bank s expansion plans, the following discussion provides a general overview of the additional branch locations that the Bank currently is considering, including the following properties that we own and are holding for expansion: Real property located in the Timberlake Road area of Campbell County (Lynchburg), Virginia. In September 2024, the Bank purchased real property commonly known as 20795 Timberlake Road, Lynchburg, Virginia. The building on the property previously served as a bank branch for another financial institution. The Bank anticipates that the cost to upfit the building will be minimal . Subject to regulatory approval, the Bank anticipates opening a branch at this location in 2025. Following acquisition of this property, the Bank decided to sell the undeveloped property it owns on Timberlake Road, which the Bank previously was holding for possible branch expansion. This property has been listed for sale and is currently being marketed. Real Property located at 2935 Rockfish Valley Highway, Nellysford, Virginia. On September 18, 2023, the Bank purchased real property located at 2935 Rockfish Valley Highway, Nellysford, Virginia. The building on the property previously served as a bank branch for another financial institution. The Bank anticipates that the cost to upfit the building will be minimal. The property is subject to a restrictive covenant that prohibits the Bank from using the property for any banking-related activity until the covenant expires in September 2025. Following the expiration of this restrictive covenant, the Bank intends to use this property as a permanent branch in Nellysford, Virginia We anticipate that we will relocate the Temporary Nellysford Branch to this location in the fall of 2025. In addition to the facilities set forth above, the Bank owns the following property which is being held for possible expansion: Real property located at 1925 Atherholt Road, Lynchburg, Virginia . On December 31, 2021, the Bank purchased real property located at 1925 Atherholt Road, Lynchburg, Virginia. The building currently serves as the offices for Financial s wholly-owned subsidiary, PWW. PWW is currently leasing the space from the Bank on a month-to-month basis. While the Bank currently does not have a timeline for a branch at this location, the space is attractive for a branch due to its close proximity to Centra s Lynchburg General Hospital. The investment needed to upfit the property will be minimal. Although the Bank cannot predict with certainty the financial impact of each new branch, management generally anticipates that each new branch will become profitable within 12 to 18 months of operation. The Bank continues to evaluate suitable branch locations and may acquire one or more properties for expansion in the next 12 months. Future branch openings are subject to regulatory approval. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Bank is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets and could impact the overall liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and/or use these commitments. The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. A summary of the Bank s commitments is as follows: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Commitments to extend credit 172,867 173,148 Letters of Credit 3,506 2,636 Total 176,373 175,784 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment 

 37 
 Table of Contents 

amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on the Bank s credit evaluation of the customer. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on the Bank s credit evaluation of the customer. The Bank has rate lock commitments to originate mortgage loans through its Mortgage Division. The Bank has entered into corresponding commitments with third party investors to sell each of these loans that close. No other obligation exists. As a result of these contractual relationships with these investors, the Bank is not exposed to losses nor will it ultimately realize gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion represents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Financial as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the results of operations of Financial for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere herein. All financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Financial Condition Summary September 30, 2024 as Compared to December 31, 2023 Total assets were 1,008,063,000 on September 30, 2024 compared with 969,371,000 at December 31, 2023, an increase of 3.99 . The increase in total assets was primarily due to increases in cash, Fed funds sold, loans, net of the allowance for credit losses, loans held for sale, and the cash value of bank-owned life insurance. The increase was offset in part by a decrease in the value of securities available-for-sale. Total deposits increased from 878,459,000 as of December 31, 2023 to 907,610,000 on September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.32 . The increase resulted in large part from increases in time deposits, NOW, money market and savings deposits and was offset in part by a decrease in noninterest-bearing demand. The increase in time deposits generally was driven by our customers desire to lock in higher interest rates while still possible. The increase in NOW, money market and savings deposits was driven by customers desire to earn interest while still maintaining liquidity. Total loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased to 634,190,000 on September 30, 2024 from 609,333,000 on December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in commercial real estate and residential loans and was offset in part by a decrease in commercial and consumer loans, which decreased due to payoffs and normal amortization of loans. Loans, excluding loans held for sale and net of deferred fees and costs and including the allowance for credit losses, increased to 627,112,000 on September 30, 2024 from 601,921,000 on December 31, 2023, an increase of 4.19 . The following summarizes the position of the Bank s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated by dollar amount and percentages (dollar amounts in thousands): September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Commercial 60,342 9.51 65,324 10.72 Commercial Real Estate 356,126 56.15 328,829 53.97 Consumer 75,090 11.84 76,517 12.56 Residential 142,632 22.49 138,663 22.76 Total loans 634,190 100.00 609,333 100.00

The subsegments of the loan portfolio of the segments shown above are set forth in Note 8. As a community bank, the Bank remains committed to growing assets through quality loan growth by providing credit to small and mid-size businesses and individuals within the markets we serve. Based on our loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans and the construction and land development loans were approximately 218.30 and 30.34 (based on interagency CRE guidelines) of total risk-based capital, respectively. We have expertise and a long history in originating and managing commercial real estate loans. We have a strong credit underwriting process, which includes management and board oversight. We perform rigorous monitoring, stress testing, and reporting of these portfolios at the management and board levels, and we continue to monitor the level of the concentration in commercial real estate loans within our loan portfolio monthly. The Bank closely monitors concentrations within its commercial real estate loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled 189,977,000, or 29.96 of total loans. The Bank has minimal exposure to loans secured by large office buildings or shopping centers, which comprise less than 5 of the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. The majority of the Bank's non-owner occupied commercial loans are secured by smaller, multi-tenant properties diversified across various industries and geographies within our market areas. The Bank does not have any non-owner occupied commercial loans secured by properties in major city centers. We have not seen an increase in delinquencies in loans secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate. In addition, to help manage risk we actively manage and monitor our commercial real estate risk through, when appropriate, the following: Origination and Analysis We have a thorough loan origination process. For all CRE loans secured by real estate collateral, we require an appraisal or valuation at the time that we originate the loan. We generally do not approve loans that have a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80 . We perform an individual property cashflow analysis and, if appropriate, a global cash flow analysis at origination and generally require a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2x. Ongoing Risk Management Following origination, we continue to manage risk. Our ongoing risk management includes: Utilizing enhanced risk rating systems specific to CRE exposures; Obtaining regular third-party loan reviews of the CRE portfolio; Obtaining subsequent appraisals when either required by regulations or dictated by our internal policies; Stress testing of property cash flows using various vacancy and rate scenarios during underwriting; Regular monitoring of local market conditions and property sector trends; Meeting at least annually with clients to which the Bank has significant exposure along with market-level monitoring of vacancy rates and rental trends; Performing annual reviews, including the review of current financial information, rate shocking, and collecting and analyzing rent rolls and operating statements at least annually; and Utilizing a risk rating system that incorporates both property and borrower performance metrics. Credit Enhancements Where appropriate, we mitigate risk by obtaining credit enhancements. Typical enhancements to CRE loans include personal guarantees, secondary collateral, and liquid collateral.

The following table sets forth information for non-owner occupied CRE Loans for the four largest categories of loans (classified by purpose code and collateral description) having the highest current principal balance: Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio (CRE) Non-Owner Occupied (in thousands) As of September 30, 2024 Collateral Description Total Number of Loans Current Balance of Total Loans Average Balance Weighted Avg LTV of Top 5 Loans (1) Multi-Family (5 or more) 42 52,600 8.29 1,252 53.81 Hotel/Motel 8 31,687 5.00 3,961 57.65 Office Building 24 23,320 3.68 972 58.05 Retail Store 26 19,452 3.20 780 63.13 
 (1) Loan-to-value is based on collateral valuation at origination date against current bank-owned principal. The following table sets forth information for owner occupied CRE Loans set forth the four largest categories of loans (classified by purpose code and collateral description) having the highest current principal balance: Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio (CRE) Owner Occupied (in thousands) As of September 30, 2024 Collateral Description Total Number of Loans Current Balance of Total Loans Average Balance Weighted Avg LTV of Top 5 Loans (1) Industrial 31 33,126 5.22 1,069 58.96 Office Building 70 26,568 4.19 378 54.33 Medical Building 25 15,346 2.42 614 73.42 Retail Store 29 14,622 2.31 504 59.72 
 (1) Loan-to-value is based on collateral valuation at origination date against current bank-owned principal. Total nonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and OREO increased to 1,295,000 on September 30, 2024 from 391,000 on December 31, 2023. Because we had no OREO on either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, the nonperforming assets consist entirely of nonperforming loans. As discussed in more detail below under Results of Operations Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses , management has provided for any anticipated losses on these loans in the allowance for credit losses. Loan payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status there are several negative implications. First, all interest accrued but unpaid at the time of the classification is reversed and deducted from the interest income totals for the Bank. Second, accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid. Third, there may be actual losses that necessitate additional provisions for credit losses charged against earnings. OREO represents real property acquired by the Bank for debts previously contracted, including through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure. We had no OREO on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bank neither acquired nor disposed of any OREO during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result, the OREO balance remained 0 as of September 30, 2024

Cash and cash equivalents increased to 109,207,000 on September 30, 2024 from 74,838,000 on December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash due from correspondents, cash in vault, and overnight investments (including Federal funds sold). This increase was due in large part to the Bank s sale of securities available-for-sale during the first nine months of 2024, as discussed in more detail below. Cash and cash equivalents are subject to routine fluctuations in deposits, including fluctuations in transactional accounts and professional settlement accounts. Securities held-to-maturity were essentially flat, decreasing slightly to 3,610,000 on September 30, 2024 from 3,622,000 on December 31, 2023. This decrease is a result of normal net amortization of premiums within the held-to-maturity portfolio. Securities available-for-sale, which are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value, decreased to 192,469,000 on September 30, 2024, from 216,510,000 on December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank purchased 15,122,000 in available-for-sale securities. During the same period the Bank sold 30,298,000 and received 13,305,000 in proceeds from calls, maturities, and paydowns of securities available-for-sale. The market value of the securities available-for-sale increased. As of September 30, 2024, we have an unrealized tax-effected loss of 17,782,000 (or 22,509,000 prior to the tax benefit). Financial does not expect to realize the losses as it has the intent and ability to hold the securities until their recovery, which may be at maturity. Financial s investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLBA) stock totaled 672,000 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 643,000 at December 31, 2023. FHLBA stock is generally viewed as a long-term investment and because there is no market for the stock other than other Federal Home Loan Banks or member institutions, FHLBA stock is viewed as a restricted security. Therefore, when evaluating FHLBA stock for impairment, its value is based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. Liquidity and Capital At September 30, 2024, Financial, on a consolidated basis, had liquid assets of 301,676,000 in the form of cash, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits with banks, and available-for-sale investments. The Bank has pledged (market values): approximately 37,000,000 of our available-for-sale securities as collateral with correspondent banks, including the FHLBA, for collateralized lines of credit; approximately 44,000,000 of our available-for-sale securities as security for public deposits; and approximately 30,000,000 of our available-for-sale securities as collateral for advances at the Federal Reserve Bank s discount window. Further, if additional liquidity is needed, the Bank has the ability to purchase up to 53,000,000 of Fed funds through the Bank s correspondent relationships and borrow from the FHLBA using investments within the Bank s portfolio as collateral. In addition to the above, the Bank has borrowing capacity with the FHLBA of approximately 20,000,000 related to loans it has pledged to the FHLBA. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank has no borrowings from any of these sources. Immediately following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the spring of 2023, out of an abundance of caution the Bank borrowed 14,000,000 from the FHLBA to test its contingency funding plan. Approximately two weeks later, the Bank repaid the advance. During the first nine months of 2024, the Bank did not experience any unusual inflows or outflows of deposits. Management believes that liquid assets were adequate at September 30, 2024. Management anticipates that additional liquidity will be provided by the growth in deposit accounts and loan repayments from customers. While we have not experienced any unusual pressure on our deposit balances or our liquidity position, management continues to closely monitor our sources and uses of funds in order to meet our cash flow requirements while attempting to maximize profits. The Company s total uninsured deposits, which are the amount of deposits, subject to the aggregation rules, that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently 250,000) were approximately 267,498,000, approximately 29.47 of our total deposits, at September 30, 2024. These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had a leverage ratio of approximately 9.62 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a CET1 ratio of approximately 12.58 and a total risk-based capital ratio of approximately 13.52 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s regulatory capital levels exceeded those established for well-capitalized institutions. The following table sets forth the minimum capital requirements and the Bank s capital position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 (1) Includes the capital conservation buffer of 2.50 for all ratios, excluding the Tier 1 capital to average total assets ratio. The above tables set forth the capital position and analysis for the Bank only. Because total assets on a consolidated basis are less than 3,000,000,000, Financial is not subject to the consolidated capital requirements imposed by the Bank Holding Company Act. Consequently, Financial does not calculate its financial ratios on a consolidated basis. If calculated, the capital ratios for the Company on a consolidated basis at September 30, 2024 would be lower than those of the Bank because a portion of proceeds from the sale of notes previously issued by the holding company were contributed to the Bank as equity. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule establishing a regulatory capital framework for smaller, less complex financial institutions. The rule was fully implemented on January 1, 2019 and implemented a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 . As a result, the Bank is required to have a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets of 4.00 (exclusive of the capital conservation buffer), a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 7.0 (inclusive of the capital conservation buffer), and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 (inclusive of the capital conservation buffer). Failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of the Bank and Financial to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses . The rule also raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 to 6 and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 for all banking organizations.

Results of Operations Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Earnings Summary Financial had net income including all operating segments of 1,990,000 and 6,326,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,078,000 and 6,596,000 for the comparable periods in 2023. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.44 and 1.39, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.46 and 1.44 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods was due primarily to an increase in interest expense of 1,275,000 and 4,984,000 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable periods in 2024. The decrease was offset in part by increases in interest income and noninterest income. These operating results represent an annualized return on average stockholders equity of 12.86 and 13.95 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared with 15.68 and 17.20 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 from the same periods in 2023 was due to the decrease in net income and an increase in average equity, which resulted from an increase in retained earnings. The Company had an annualized return on average assets of 0.80 and 0.86 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared with 0.86 and 0.93 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. The decreases largely resulted from a decrease in net income and an increase in average assets. See Noninterest Income below for mortgage business and wealth management segment discussions. Interest Income, Interest Expense, and Net Interest Income For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased to 11,563,000 and 33,007,000 from 10,143,000 and 28,824,000 for the same periods in 2023, primarily to an increase in interest rates received on our interest-earning assets. The average rate on loans was 5.65 and 5.45 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.13 and 4.99 for the same periods in 2023. The rate on total average earning assets increased to 4.86 and 4.70 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 because of a general increase in market rates and because the loans that we originated in the last six to twelve months had rates significantly higher than the rates referenced above. Interest expense increased significantly to 4,054,000 and 11,457,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,779,000 and 6,473,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three and nine months resulted primarily from an increase in deposit balances and an increase in interest rates paid on deposits during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 2.01 and 1.93 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.43 and 1.10 for the same periods in 2023. The Company s average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 2.05 and 1.97 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.49 and 1.18 for the same periods in 2023. We anticipate a slight decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to the FOMC s decision to lower the Fed funds rate in September. The fundamental source of the Bank s net revenue is net interest income, which is determined by the difference between (i) interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets, which consist primarily of loans, investment securities and other investments, and (ii) interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, which consist principally of deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7,509,000 and 21,550,000 as compared to 7,364,000 and 22,351,000 for the same periods in 2023. The net interest margin was 3.16 and 3.07 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.21 and 3.33 for the comparable periods in 2023. The decreases for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, were in large part due to interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities increasing more rapidly than the rates received on interest-earning assets during each of the first three quarters of the year. This was exacerbated by a change in deposit mix, with the balance of time deposits, which generally pay a higher rate than demand deposits, increasing year over year while the average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits decreased over the same period. To combat inflation, the FOMC implemented a series of interest rate increases beginning in March 2022. These increases negatively impacted our net interest margin. Despite the Fed s rate cut in September of 2024, the current interest rate environment is likely to continue to cause long-term uncertainty. For example, While management does not anticipate it will be necessary to raise deposit rates, if we need to raise rates on deposits, there likely would be an adverse impact on our margin and profitability. A stabilizing interest rate environment is likely to allow us to increase our net interest margin.

In the event of rapid rate decreases, in the short term our net interest margin could come under pressure as the Bank is currently asset-sensitive. Other financial impacts could occur, though such potential impacts are unknown at this time. Financial s net interest margin analysis and average balance sheets are shown in Schedule I below. Noninterest Income Noninterest income is comprised primarily of fees and charges on transactional deposit accounts, gains on sales of mortgage loans held for sale, commissions on sales of investments, fees generated from treasury management services, fees generated from our investment advisory business, and bank-owned life insurance income. Noninterest income increased to 3,823,000 and 11,321,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 from 3,201,000 and 9,689,000 for same periods in 2023. The overall increases primarily were due to increases in wealth management fees, life insurance income, gains on sales of loans, and income received from an investment in a Small Business Investment Company fund, which is reflected in other income. The Bank, through its Mortgage division, originates both conforming and non-conforming consumer residential mortgage loans in the markets we serve. As part of the Bank s overall risk management strategy, all of the loans originated and closed by the Mortgage division are presold to major national mortgage banking or financial institutions. The Mortgage division assumes, except in limited circumstances such as first payment default, no credit or interest rate risk on these mortgages. Purchase mortgage originations totaled 31,016,000 and 120,657,000 or 84.98 and 83.02 respectively, of the total mortgage loans originated in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 37,811,000 and 105,228,000 or 89.00 and 84.80 , respectively, of the total mortgage loans originated in the same period in 2023. Because of a relatively higher mortgage interest rate environment, management anticipates that in the short-term purchase mortgage originations will continue to represent a significant percentage of mortgage originations. Management also believes that a continued increase in long-term market interest rates could limit refinancing activity. Mortgage rates increased dramatically in 2022 and 2023 and remain elevated compared to recent history. These increases continue to have a negative impact on mortgage origination volume. Because of the uncertainty surrounding current and near-term economic conditions arising from inflation and geopolitical and economic concerns, management cannot predict future mortgage rates. Management also believes that the relatively high interest rates could cause revenue from the mortgage segment to remain under additional pressure. Our Investment division provides brokerage services through an agreement with a third-party broker-dealer. Pursuant to this arrangement, the third-party broker-dealer operates a service center adjacent to one of the branches of the Bank. The center is staffed by two dual employees of the Bank and the broker-dealer. Investment receives commissions on transactions generated and, in some cases, ongoing management fees such as mutual fund 12b-1 fees. The Investment division s financial impact on our consolidated revenue has been minimal. Although management cannot predict the financial impact of Investment with certainty, management anticipates the Investment division s revenue as a percentage of our overall noninterest will remain minimal in 2024. We conduct our investment advisory business through PWW, which Financial acquired on December 31, 2021. PWW is a Lynchburg, Virginia-based investment advisory firm that has approximately 828 million in assets under management and advisement as of September 30, 2024. PWW operates as a subsidiary of Financial. PWW generates revenue primarily through investment advisory fees. The investment advisory fees will vary based on the value of assets under management. Assets under management may fluctuate due to both client action and fluctuations in the equity and debt markets. Despite the potential for fluctuation, we anticipate that PWW will continue to contribute meaningfully to the Company s consolidated net income. The Bank provides insurance and annuity products to Bank customers and others, through the Bank s Insurance subsidiary. The Bank has three employees that are licensed to sell insurance products through Insurance. Insurance generates minimal revenue and its financial impact on our consolidated revenue has been immaterial. Management anticipates that Insurance s impact on noninterest income will remain immaterial for the remainder of 2024.

Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 8,776,000 and 25,602,000 from 8,140,000 and 24,091,000 for the same periods in 2023, increases of 7.81 and 6.27 , respectively. These increases resulted primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits and to a lesser extent in the nine month period, professional, data processing and other outside expenses. While other expenses increased for the three and nine month periods in 2024, the increase for the nine months was due large part because we had a recovery in 2023 related to a previous fraud loss, which had the effect of reducing other expense for the nine month period in 2023. Total personnel expense was 4,920,000 and 14,256,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4,683,000 and 13,296,000 for the same periods in 2023. Personnel expense increased largely because of increases in salaries, compensation related accruals, and additional personnel hired in connection with the opening of new branches. Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents an amount that, in our judgment, will be adequate to absorb probable losses expected in the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses increases the allowance, and loans charged-off, net of recoveries, reduce the allowance. The provision for the allowance for credit losses is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance to a level deemed appropriate by management. As discussed below, loans having a risk rating of 7 or below that are significantly past due, and loans with borrowers whose performance and financial condition provide evidence that it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts when due, are evaluated for specific impairment. The general reserve component is based on an evaluation of general economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, and loan performance measures. Based on the application of the credit loss calculation, the Bank recorded a provision of 92,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and provision recoveries of 584,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to provision recoveries of 164,000 and 278,000 for the same periods in 2023. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the provision recovery attributable to unfunded commitments was 90,000 and 90,000, respectively, and was not included in the allowance. Despite an increase in loan balances, the amount of additional provision otherwise needed to reflect loan growth was offset in part by principal recoveries of loans previously charged off of approximately 21,000 and 244,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. A September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was 1.12 of total loans outstanding, versus 1.22 and 1.21 of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses for individually evaluated loans was 0 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As shown in Note 8, the total balance in the allowance decreased, from 7,412,000 as of December 31, 2023 to 7,078,000 as of September 30, 2024. Charged-off loans, which are loans that management deems uncollectible, are charged against the allowance for credit losses and constitute a realized loss. We had charged-off loans of 0 and 84,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 144,000 and 196,000 for the same periods in 2023. While a charged-off loan may subsequently be collected, such recoveries generally are realized over an extended period of time. We had principal recoveries of 21,000 and 244,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to principal recoveries of 8,000 and 200,000 for the same periods in 2023. If indicated by Bank policy, certain nonaccrual loans are individually analyzed for impairment. The principal balance on our nonaccrual loans totaled 1,295,000 and 391,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If interest on these loans had been accrued, such income cumulatively would have approximated 51,000 and 37,000 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loan payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status there are several negative implications. First, all interest accrued but unpaid at the time of the classification is deducted from the interest income totals for the Bank. Second, accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid. Third, there may be actual losses that necessitate additional provisions for credit losses charged against earnings. Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Financial had an income tax expense of 474,000 and 1,527,000 as compared to 511,000 and 1,631,000 for the same periods in 2023. This represents an effective tax rate of 19.24 and 19.44 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 19.74 and 19.82 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective rate was lower than the statutory corporate tax rate in all periods primarily because of federal income tax benefits resulting from the tax treatment of earnings on bank owned life insurance, and interest earned on tax free municipal bonds.
