Empire has completed 13 wells in North Dakota

On April 9, 2024, Empire partially exercised a purchase
option originally issued on August 9, 2023, (the Purchase Option to acquire additional working interests in certain of
Empire s New Mexico properties from Energy Evolution, a related party. The additional assets acquired represent approximately 60 
of the total assets collectively acquired by Empire and Energy Evolution in the third quarter of 2023 (the Option Assets ).
As consideration, upon closing of the partial exercise of the Purchase Option, Empire issued Energy Evolution shares of common
stock of Empire based on an agreed upon price of per share for an aggregate agreed upon value of which was 60 of the
purchase price of under the Purchase Option. Pursuant to the remaining unexercised portion of the Purchase Option, Empire
had the right to extend the initial one-year Purchase Option period for two successive one-year periods by agreeing to issue additional
shares of common stock prior to the end of the one-year period then in effect. On August 8, 2024, Empire successfully extended the Purchase
Option with the issuance of shares of common stock to Energy Evolution, and as such, Empire has the right to acquire the remaining
Option Assets for an exercise price of , subject to certain adjustments and payable in cash, unless the parties agree that
some or all may be paid by issuance of common stock to Energy Evolution. The Purchase Option expires on August 9, 2026.

Long-Term Debt 

On December 29, 2023, Empire North Dakota and
Empire NDA Borrowers ), 

The Revolver is guaranteed by Empire. Borrowers
entered into a security agreement, pursuant to which the obligations under the Revolver are secured by liens on substantially all of
the assets of Borrowers. Furthermore, the obligations under the Revolver are secured by a continuing, first priority mortgage lien, pledge
of and security interest in not less than 80 of Borrowers producing oil, gas and other leasehold and mineral interests, including
without limitation, those situated in the States of North Dakota and Montana. 

The Revolver requires Borrowers to, commencing
as of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, maintain (a) a current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 or more and (b) a ratio of funded debt to
EBITDAX, calculated quarterly and annually based on a trailing twelve-month basis, of no more than 3.50 to 1.00. Empire was not in compliance
with the current ratio covenant as of September 30, 2024, however, Empire received a compliance waiver from the lender for September
30, 2024. 

Promissory Note Related Party 

On February 16, 2024, Empire issued a Promissory
Note in the aggregate principal amount of (the Note to Energy Evolution. Energy Evolution advanced Empire 
under the Note. The proceeds of the Note were used by Empire to fund, in part, its ongoing oil and gas drilling program and for working
capital purposes. 

The Note matures on February 15, 2026, (the
 Maturity Date and accrues interest at the rate of per annum. After the Maturity Date, any principal balance of the
Note remaining unpaid accrues interest at the rate of per annum. At the option of Energy Evolution, interest payments will be paid
either in cash or in shares of common stock of Empire on each of the following dates (or if any such date is not a business day, the
next following business day) (each an Interest Payment Date ), except upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, in which
case interest will accrue and be paid in cash on demand: (i) March 31, 2024; (ii) June 30, 2024; (iii) September 30, 2024;
(iv) December 31, 2024; (v) March 31, 2025; (vi) June 30, 2025; (vii) September 30, 2025; (viii) December 31,
2025; and (ix) the Maturity Date. All or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Note may be converted into shares of
common stock of Empire at a conversion price of 6.25 per share (the Conversion Price ), at the option of Energy Evolution,
at any time and from time to time. If the full principal amount of the Note is drawn and converted into shares of common stock of Empire,
800,000 shares would be issued (without giving effect to any interest that may be converted). Accrued interest on the principal amount
converted will be due on the applicable date of conversion in cash or, at the option of Energy Evolution, by issuance of shares of common
stock of Empire in the manner set forth in the Note (where the date of conversion is the relevant Interest Payment Date ). The
Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments. The Note may be prepaid at any time or from time to time without the consent of
Energy Evolution and without penalty or premium, provided that Empire provides Energy Evolution with at least five business days prior
written notice, each principal payment is made in cash and all accrued interest is paid in cash, or at the option of Energy Evolution,
the accrued interest may be paid by issuance of shares of common stock of Empire in the manner set forth in the Note (where the Interest
Payment Date is the date of prepayment). 

Empire determined that an embedded conversion
feature included in the Note required bifurcation from the host contract that is recognized as a separate derivative liability carried
at fair value. All of the other embedded features of the Note were clearly and closely related
to the debt host and did not require bifurcation as a derivative liability. 

Note Payable Related Party 

In August 2020, Empire, through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Empire Texas, entered into a joint development agreement (the JDA with Petroleum Independent Exploration,
LLC and related entities PIE ), a related party (see Note 14), dated August 1, 2020. Under the terms of the JDA, PIE will
perform recompletion or workover on specified mutually agreed upon wells Workover Wells owned by Empire Texas. Concurrent
with the JDA with PIE, Empire entered into a term loan agreement dated August 1, 2020, whereby PIE will loan up to , at an
interest rate of per annum, maturing August 6, 2024, unless terminated earlier by PIE. The loan proceeds were used for recompletion
or workover of certain designated wells. 

On July 31, 2024, PIE, Empire Texas, and Empire
entered into a note repayment and loan termination agreement providing for the payment in full of the remaining outstanding amount of
the PIE loan and extending the loan maturity date to December 31, 2024, unless terminated earlier by PIE. As payment in full,
Empire issued PIE 205,427 shares of common stock of Empire following the approval of a supplemental listing application by the NYSE American
stock exchange in the third quarter of 2024. 

The corporate office
has an option to renew for an additional five -year term. The option to renew the lease is generally not considered reasonably certain
to be exercised. Therefore, the period covered by such optional period is not included in the determination of the term of the lease
and the lease payments during these periods are similarly excluded from the calculation of right-of-use lease asset and lease liability
balances. 

Empire also leases vehicles primarily used in
our field operations. These vehicle leases typically have a three -year life. 

Empire recognizes right-of-use lease expense
on a straight-line basis, except for certain variable expenses that are recognized when the variability is resolved, typically during
the period in which they are paid. Variable right-of-use lease payments typically include charges for property taxes, insurance, and
variable payments related to non-lease components, including common area maintenance. 

Right-of-use lease expense was approximately
 and for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash paid for right-of-use leases was approximately
 and for the same periods. 

Supplemental balance sheet information related to the right-of-use
leases is as follows: 

Current portion of lease liability 

Long-term lease liability 

Total right-of-use lease liabilities 

The weighted-average remaining term for Empire s right-of-use

Preferred Stock 

Preferred stock may be issued from time to time
in one or more series at the direction of the Board of Directors. The directors also have the ability to fix dividend rates and rights,
liquidation preferences, voting rights, conversion rights, rights and terms of redemption and other rights, preferences, privileges and

Series
A Voting Preferred Stock 

On March 8, 2022, Empire formalized the issuance
of preferred stock as was required under the terms of Empire's May 2021 financing agreements with Energy Evolution and issued 6 shares
of Series A Voting Preferred Stock. The Series A Voting Preferred Stock was issued in connection
with the strategic investment in Empire by Energy Evolution. For so long as the Series A Voting Preferred Stock is outstanding, Empire s
Board of Directors will consist of six directors. Three of the directors are designated as the Series A Directors and the three other
directors (each, a common director are elected by the holders of common stock and/or any preferred stock (other than the
Series A Voting Preferred Stock) granted the right to vote on the common directors. Any Series A Director may be removed with or without

the right to vote on the Series A Directors. The approval of the holders of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock, voting separately and

rights, privileges, benefits, or characteristics of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock, including without limitation, any action to
modify the number, structure and/or composition of Empire s current Board of Directors. 

The Series
A Voting Preferred Stock is held by Phil Mulacek, chairman of the Board of Directors and one of the principals of Energy Evolution, as
Energy Evolution s designee (the Initial Holder ). The Series A Voting Preferred Stock may be transferred only to
certain controlled affiliates of the Initial Holder Permitted Transferees ), and 

The Series A Voting
Preferred Stock is not entitled to receive any dividends or distributions of cash or other property except in the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Empire s affairs. In such event, before any amount is paid to the holders of Empire s common
stock but after any amount is paid to the holders of Empire s senior securities, the holders of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock
will be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to 1.00. 

Except as discussed
above or as otherwise set forth in the certificate of designation of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A
Voting Preferred Stock have no voting rights. 

The Series A Voting
Preferred Stock is not redeemable at Empire s election or the election of any holder, except Empire may elect to redeem the 

any or all shares of
 Series A Voting Preferred Stock are held by anyone other than the Initial Holder or a Permitted Transferee; or 

the Series A Holders
 together hold less than shares of Empire s outstanding common stock. 

The Series A Voting
Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock or any other security.

to one vote per share for all matters on which common stockholders are authorized to vote on. Examples of matters that common stockholders
are entitled to vote on include, but are not limited to, election of three of the six directors and other common voting situations afforded

30 days after March 23, 2023, rather than in monthly installments. This was accrued as of March 31, 2023, and payment was made in April
2023. Empire also extended the period under which Mr. Pritchard has the right to exercise his outstanding vested non-qualified stock
options from three months after the date of his termination of employment to September 16, 2024. In addition, Mr. Pritchard has
surrendered to Empire RSUs and options as satisfaction for the million receivable that primarily resulted from incorrect
withholdings associated with an April 2022 option exercise by Mr. Pritchard. Empire also had a million liability recorded at December
31, 2022, related to withholding payables that were remitted in 2023. 

On March 17, 2023, the Board of Directors appointed
Michael R. Morrisett to the position of Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Morrisett did not receive any additional compensation for assuming
the role of Chief Executive Officer. 

. Other than the full year of 2022, Empire has generated net operating losses since inception, which would normally reflect
a tax benefit in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and a deferred asset on the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated balance sheets. However, because of the current uncertainty as to Empire s ability to achieve sustained
profitability, a valuation reserve has been established that offsets the amount of any tax benefit available for each period presented
in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Item 2. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
 OPERATIONS 

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including
this section, includes certain statements that may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities
laws. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, which address activities, events, or developments that Empire expects,
believes, or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including future sources of financing and other possible business developments,
are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties and could be affected
by a number of distinct factors, including Empire s failure to secure short and long-term financing necessary to sustain and grow
its operations, increased competition, changes in the markets in which Empire participates and the technology utilized by Empire and
new legislation regarding environmental matters. These risks and other risks that could affect Empire's business are more fully described
in reports Empire files with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Actual results may
vary materially from the forward-looking statements. Empire undertakes no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements in this
Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

Our primary business is the optimization and
development of oil and gas interests. In 2022 we had net income from operations but have incurred losses from operations in 2023 and
2024 and in years prior to 2022. There is no assurance that we will be profitable or obtain funds necessary to finance our future operations. 

We seek to increase shareholder value by growing
reserves, production, revenues, and cash flow from operating activities by executing our mission to use highly-skilled personnel to thoughtfully
and expertly spend capital to realize reserves on producing properties as well as further develop fields. 

Management places emphasis on operating cash
flow in managing our business, as operating cash flow considers the cash expenses incurred during the period and excludes non-cash expenditures
not related directly to our operations. 

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is to obtain long-term
growth in reserves and cash flow on a cost-effective basis. Management regularly evaluates potential acquisitions of properties that
would enhance current core areas of operation. 

Critical Accounting
Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP requires management to use judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements. As additional information becomes available, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change and thus impact
amounts reported in the future. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that involve judgment and uncertainties affecting
the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or
using differing assumptions. Management periodically updates the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based
on management s latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. There have been no significant
changes to Empire s critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES 

General 

Empire s primary sources of short-term
liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operating activities, and issuance of debt or equity securities. Empire s
short- and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures, acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties,
payments of contractual obligations, and working capital obligations. Funding for these requirements may be provided by any combination
of Empire s sources of liquidity. Although Empire expects that its sources of funding will be adequate to fund its liquidity requirements,
no assurance can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet Empire s future needs. 

18 

Liquidity 

As noted below, our working capital is negative
as of September 30, 2024, which is primarily the result of a higher level of payables related to capital spending as part of our Starbuck
Drilling Program in North Dakota. In addition, Empire was not in compliance with the current ratio covenant under the Revolver as of
September 30, 2024; however, Empire obtained a compliance waiver from the lender for September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024,
we had approximately 3.1 million in cash on hand and approximately 0.2 million available on the Revolver. Empire will require additional
funds to be in compliance with debt covenants and satisfy the payables discussed above which are greater than estimated cash flows from
operations over the next 12 months. Phil Mulacek and Energy Evolution Master Fund, Ltd, both related parties of Empire and our largest
two shareholders, owning 20.3 and 31.4 , respectively, of the common shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024, have indicated that
they will, and have the ability to, provide sufficient support to sustain the operating, investing, and financing activities of Empire,
as necessary. In addition to the November Rights Offering, discussed elsewhere in this document, management continues to seek additional
sources of capital via the debt or equity markets to improve liquidity going forward. See the liquidity and going concern discussion
included in notes to unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, presented elsewhere in this document, for further
discussion of management s plans. 

Empire expects to continue to incur costs related
to drilling activities in core areas as well as future oil and natural gas acquisitions in core areas. As of September 30, 2024, Empire
has incurred approximately 38.3 million of additions to oil and natural gas properties, primarily related to the drilling program in
the Starbuck field of North Dakota. It is expected that Empire will use a combination of debt or equity issuances, cash on hand, and
cash flows from operations to fund capital programs, ongoing operations, and any potential acquisitions. 

Working Capital 

Working capital, presented below, decreased
by approximately 9.0 million between December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024. This change was primarily driven by payables related
to the Starbuck Drilling Program in North Dakota and a lower cash balance at September 30, 2024.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

The impact of higher oil production and lower
workover expenses in 2024 compared to 2023 contributed to the increase in cash flows from operating activities. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Cash flows from investing activities in the
first nine months of 2024 include approximately 48.8 million of additions to oil and natural gas properties primarily due to the development
of our operations as part of our Starbuck Drilling Program in North Dakota. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash flow from financing activities in 2024
includes net proceeds from the April Rights Offering of approximately 20.5 million (see Note 10). In addition, cash flows from financing
activities in 2024 includes 5.0 million from a promissory note issued to Empire by a related party and approximately 4.0 million borrowed
on Empire s Revolver (see Note 8).

Capital Resources 

Capital Expenditures 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
Empire incurred approximately 38.3 million of additions to oil and natural gas properties which primarily reflects continued drilling
and completions activity related to our Starbuck Drilling Program in North Dakota. 

Production and Operating Data 

The following table sets forth a summary of
Empire s production and operating data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Because of normal production
declines, increased or decreased production due to future acquisitions, divestitures, and development, and fluctuations in commodity
prices, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results.

Revenues 

Revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2024, increased slightly compared to the prior year primarily due to higher oil, natural gas and NGL sales volumes, substantially
offset by lower realized oil and natural gas prices. 

Net oil sales volumes were approximately 145,000
Bbls for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 20 over the same period in the prior year. Oil volumes
in third-quarter 2024 increased primarily due to new wells completed in North Dakota during the period as well as the acquisition of
additional working interest in New Mexico. 

Realized oil prices for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, were 71.48 per barrel, while realized prices for the same period in the prior year were 78.98 per barrel, a decrease
in price of approximately 9 . 

Realized natural gas prices for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, were 0.03 per mcf, while realized prices for the same period in the prior year were 2.10 per mcf. This is
primarily due to the depressed natural gas prices in the third quarter of 2024 in New Mexico. 

Realized NGL prices for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, were 13.84 per barrel, while realized prices for the same period in the prior year were 11.57 per barrel, an increase
in price of approximately 20 . 

Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes 

Lease operating expense was lower for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower workover costs. Lease operating expense includes
approximately 1.4 million of workover expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.2 million for the same
period in 2023. The higher workover expense in 2023 was primarily in New Mexico as Empire continued to work over wells in the region
to enhance and maintain production. 

Production taxes were higher for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of the higher product revenues discussed above. 

21 

Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and
Accretion 

The higher DD A for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 is due in part to the increase in production, the acquisition of additional working
interest as well as the impact of the capitalized costs associated with the new drilling activity as part of our Starbuck Drilling Program
in North Dakota. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense, excluding
stock-based compensation, increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to
an increase in salaries and benefits period over period associated with an increase in employee headcount. 

Stock-based Compensation 

Empire utilizes stock-based compensation to
compensate the Board, members of management, and retain talented personnel. Empire anticipates stock-based compensation to continue to
be utilized in 2024 and beyond to attract and retain talented personnel and compensate Board members and consultants. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to lower cash interest expense from lower average debt balances
in the third quarter of 2024 compared to third-quarter 2023.

Revenues 

Revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher oil, natural gas, and NGL sales volumes, partially offset by lower
realized oil and natural gas prices. 

Net oil sales volumes were approximately 436,000
Bbls for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 18 over the same period in the prior year. Oil volumes
in 2024 increased primarily due to new wells completed in North Dakota during the period as well as the acquisition of additional working
interest in New Mexico. 

Realized oil prices for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, were 73.60 per barrel, while realized prices for the same period in the prior year were 74.77, a decrease in price
of approximately 2 . 

Realized natural gas prices for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, were 0.38 per mcf, while realized prices for the same period in the prior year were 2.06, a decrease in price
of approximately 72 . The lower prices in 2024 are primarily due to depressed natural gas prices in New Mexico during the period. 

Realized NGL prices for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, were approximately 13.87 per barrel, while realized prices for the same period in the prior year were approximately
 12.06 per barrel, an increase in price of approximately 15 . 

Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes 

The increase in lease operating expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily associated with an increase in production, partially offset by lower workover
expenses year over year. Lease operating expense includes approximately 5.3 million of workover expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 8.9 million for the same period in 2023. The higher workover expense in 2023 was primarily in New Mexico as
Empire continued to work over wells in the region to enhance and maintain production. 

Production taxes were higher for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of the higher product revenues discussed above. 

23 

Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and
Accretion 

The higher DD A in 2024 is due in part to
the increase in production, the acquisition of additional working interest in New Mexico as well as the impact of the capitalized costs
associated with drilling activity associated with our Starbuck Drilling Program in North Dakota. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense, excluding
stock-based compensation, increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to
an increase in salaries and benefits period over period associated with an increase in employee headcount. 

Stock-based Compensation 

Empire utilizes stock-based compensation to
compensate members of the Board, management, and retain talented personnel. Empire anticipates stock-based compensation to continue to
be utilized in 2024 and beyond to attract and retain talented personnel and compensate Board members and consultants. The decrease year
over year is primarily due to Board of Directors awards in 2023. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased in 2024 compared
to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher cash interest expense and the amortization of the debt discount both associated with
the Promissory Note that was issued in 2024 (see Note 8).

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, Empire carried out an evaluation under the supervision and participation of Empire s Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, along with our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Empire s disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, Empire s Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period
covered by this report, in ensuring the information required to be disclosed by Empire in the reports it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including Empire s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive
officer and principal financial officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

While we continue to
implement design enhancements to our internal control procedures, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting
during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which were identified in connection with the evaluation that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. It is management s expectation
that Empire will implement enhanced controls throughout 2024 with additional controls implemented as they are identified by management.
Management will continue to diligently and rigorously review the financial reporting controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of
Controls 

Empire s disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
desired objectives. Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of their inherent
limitations, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors or
misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.
