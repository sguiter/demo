Invesco CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust 
 Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2024 

when the Sponsor deposited Swiss Francs in the Trust s primary deposit account held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch (the Depository ). The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company whose sole member is Invesco Capital Management. The Trust has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Trust s shares (the Shares to reflect the price in U.S. Dollars USD of the Swiss Franc plus accrued interest, if any, less the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to provide investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding Swiss Francs. The Trust s assets primarily consist of Swiss Francs on demand deposit in deposit accounts maintained by the Depository: a primary deposit account which may earn interest and a secondary deposit account which does not earn interest. The secondary deposit account is used to account for any interest that may be received and paid out on creations and redemptions of blocks of Shares Baskets ). The secondary account is also used to account for interest earned, if any, on the primary deposit account, pay Trust expenses and distribute any excess interest to holders of Shares Shareholders on a monthly basis. This Quarterly Report (the Report covers the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements have been made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Trust s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024 .

 provision for federal income taxes is required. Interest, gains and losses are passed through to the Shareholders. Shareholders generally will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro-rata share of the assets held in the Trust. Shareholders also will be treated as if they directly received their respective pro-rata portion of the Trust s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro-rata portion of the Trust s expenses. The acquisition of Shares by a U.S. Shareholder as part of a creation of a Basket will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Sponsor s fee accrues daily and is payable monthly. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an accrual-basis U.S. Shareholder generally will be required to take into account as an expense its allocable portion of the USD-equivalent of the amount of the Sponsor s fee that is accrued on each day, with such USD-equivalent being determined by the currency exchange rate that is in effect on the respective day. To the extent that the currency exchange rate on the date of payment of the accrued amount of the Sponsor s fee differs from the currency exchange rate in effect on the day of accrual, the U.S. Shareholder will recognize a currency gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for interest income (if any) and gain (if any) upon the sale of Swiss Francs. A non-U.S. Shareholder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of Swiss Francs by the Trust, unless: (1) the non-U.S. Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States.

 period for settlement of each creation or redemption, the Trust reflects Shares created as a receivable on the trade date. Shares redeemed are reflected as a liability on the trade date. Outstanding Shares are reflected at redemption value, which is the NAV per Share at the period end date. Adjustments to redeemable capital Shares at redemption value are recorded directly to redeemable capital shares and retained earnings. The Trustee calculates the Trust s NAV each business day. To calculate the NAV, the Trustee subtracts the Sponsor s accrued fee through the previous day from the Swiss Francs held by the Trust (including all unpaid interest, if any, accrued through the preceding day) and calculates the value of the Swiss Francs in USD based upon the Closing Spot Rate. If, on a particular evaluation day, the Closing Spot Rate has not been determined and announced by 6:00 PM (London time), then the most recent Closing Spot

 Overview/Introduction 
 The Invesco CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust (the Trust is a grantor trust that was formed on June 8, 2006. The Shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FXF on June 26, 2006. The primary listing of the Shares was transferred to NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca on October 30, 2007. The Trust issues shares (the Shares in blocks of 50,000 (a Basket in exchange for deposits of Swiss Francs and distributes Swiss Francs in connection with the redemption of Baskets. 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the price in USD of the Swiss Franc plus accrued interest, if any, less the expenses of the Trust s operations. The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the market for the Swiss Franc through an investment in securities. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding the Swiss Franc. The Shares are bought and sold on NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed security. The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust, which does not hold or use derivative products. The Trust is a passive investment vehicle and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of the Swiss Franc. Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The value of the holdings of the Trust is reported on the Trust s website, www.invesco.com/etfs, each business day. 
 Definition of Net Asset Value 
 The Trustee calculates, and the Sponsor publishes, the Trust s Net Asset Value NAV each business day. To calculate the NAV, the Trustee adds to the amount of Swiss Francs in the Trust at the end of the preceding day accrued but unpaid interest, if any, Swiss Francs receivable under pending purchase orders and the value of other Trust assets, and subtracts the accrued but unpaid Sponsor s fee, Swiss Francs payable under pending redemption orders and other Trust expenses and liabilities, if any. The NAV is expressed in USD based on the Swiss Franc/USD exchange rate as determined by The WM Company at 4:00 PM (London time / London fixing) (the Closing Spot Rate on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. If, on a particular evaluation day, the Closing Spot Rate has not been determined and announced by 6:00 PM (London time), then the most recent Closing Spot Rate is used to determine the NAV of the Trust unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for the valuation. 
 The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share, which equals the NAV of the Trust divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share are published by the Sponsor on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading and are posted on the Trust s website, www.invesco.com/etfs.

Movements in the Price of the Swiss Franc 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the price in USD of the Swiss Franc plus accrued interest, if any, less the expenses of the Trust s operations. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding Swiss Francs. Each outstanding Share represents a proportional interest in the Swiss Francs held by the Trust. The following chart provides recent trends on the price of the Swiss Franc. The chart illustrates movements in the price of the Swiss Franc in USD and is based on the Closing Spot Rate:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Trust does not have any material cash requirements as of the end of the latest fiscal period. The Sponsor is not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or are reasonably likely to result in, material changes to the Trust s liquidity and capital resources needs. The Trust s Depository, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, maintains two deposit accounts for the Trust, a primary deposit account that may earn interest and a secondary deposit account that does not earn interest. Interest on the primary deposit account, if any, accrues daily and is paid monthly. The interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2024 was an annual nominal rate of 0.20 . The following chart provides the daily rate paid by the Depository since September 30, 2019: 

In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor bears most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s fee. Each month the Depository deposits into the secondary deposit account accrued but unpaid interest, if any, and the Trustee withdraws Swiss Francs from the secondary deposit account to pay the accrued Sponsor s fee for the previous month plus other Trust expenses (including, without limitation, expenses resulting from negative interest rates), if any. When the interest deposited, if any, exceeds the sum of the Sponsor s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any, the Trustee converts the excess into USD at the prevailing market rate and distributes the USD as promptly as practicable to Shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of Shares that they own). The Trust did not make any distributions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 3 to the financial statements of the Trust for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies and Item 7 Management s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Results of Operations 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Trust s net comprehensive income (loss) was, in part, impacted by market volatility resulting from expectations around the Federal Reserve (the Fed easing and heightened geopolitical concerns for 2024, and the US banking sector turmoil for 2023 which are considered to be unusual or infrequent events. Although the full and direct impact of Fed easing expectations, rising geopolitical tensions, and the US banking sector turmoil on the Trust s net comprehensive income (loss) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 cannot be known, it is believed that they have each independently impacted the Closing Spot Rate, the interest rate paid by the Depository, and the global economy and markets generally, including the number of Shares created and redeemed by the Trust. 
 The Swiss franc (CHF/USD) ended the third quarter of 2024 with strong gains. While partially due to US dollar weakness the US Federal Reserve (Fed) officially kicked off its easing cycle in September the Swiss franc is generally also seen as a safe-haven currency due to its strong economy. Thus, it benefitted from the selloff in the US equity market at the end of July into August, US election uncertainty, spiking geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and briefly, reignited recession concerns in the US due to disappointing labor data. 
 The Swiss franc (CHF/USD) depreciated against the US dollar in the third quarter of 2023, largely due to renewed dollar strength and the Swiss National Bank s (SNB) relatively dovish policies. While the Fed continued to stick to its higher-for-longer rhetoric and kept the windows open for further hikes, the SNB called a surprise end to its rate hikes in September, further cementing the yield differential between the currencies the SNB kept their benchmark rate at 1.75 compared to over 5 in the US. With domestic inflation sitting below the 2 ceiling and SNB officials signaling they are comfortable with current inflation, the chances of further hikes significantly decreased for the Swiss franc, adding downward pressure on the pair. 
 The Swiss franc (CHF/USD) posted a slight loss in the first three quarters of 2024. US dollar strength in Q1 and Q2 due to the Fed s higher-for-longer rhetoric was the overarching headwind. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) was also the first major central bank to start cutting its interest rates in March; lower interest rates reduce the appeal of the country s currency. That said, gains from Q3 helped erase most of earlier losses. Not only did the Fed and many other global central banks begin their rate easing cycle but the pair also benefitted from increasing safe haven demand due to geopolitical tension, and US economic and equity market turmoil. 
 The Swiss franc (CHF/USD) posted a small gain in the first three quarters of 2023 with price action largely driven by dollar moves and SNB policies. The USD fell sharply in January, helping the pair rally, as speculation for a dovish pivot in Fed rate hike plans grew. However, with the dollar making a turnaround in February due to signs of a strong labor market and resilient inflation in the US, the currency pair depreciated. In March though, the pair returned to positive territory as the US dollar once again weakened amid the turmoil in the US banking sector. While Switzerland s banking sector also took a hit following the collapse of Credit Suisse, the impact was limited given swift government intervention. While Q2 was largely the same theme, with the CHF bouncing back and forth on Fed-driven dollar moves, the pair also received support from rising safe haven demand. Q3 marked a negative period for the Swiss franc as the SNB turned increasingly dovish, especially when compared with the US Fed, which held on to its higher for longer guidance. 
 Additionally, the interest rate paid by the Depository has generally trended upward over the past year, slightly offset by decline in the recent quarters, to the current interest rate of 0.20 , as set forth in the FXF Rate Chart above. As long as the Sponsor s fee and the interest expense on currency deposits, if any, exceed interest income, the Trust will incur a net comprehensive loss. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Except as described above with respect to fluctuations in the Swiss Franc/USD exchange rate and changes in the nominal annual interest rate paid by the Depository on Swiss Francs held by the Trust, the Trust is not subject to market risk.
