 Senior Secured Term Loans 
 In April 2018, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Altisource S. r.l., entered into a credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain lenders (the Credit Agreement ). Under the Credit Agreement, Altisource borrowed million in the form of senior secured term loans SSTL ). Effective February 14, 2023, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and Altisource S. r.l. entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (as amended by Amendment No. 2, the Amended Credit Agreement ). Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and its subsidiaries, subject to the applicable exclusions in the Amended Credit Agreement, are guarantors on the SSTL (collectively, the Guarantors ). Effective June 1, 2023, the administrative agent and collateral agent of the Amended Credit Agreement changed to Wilmington Trust, N.A. 
 The maturity date of the SSTL under the Amended Credit Agreement is April 30, 2025. Since the aggregate amount of par paydowns on the SSTL made prior to February 14, 2024 using proceeds from issuances of equity interests or from junior indebtedness Aggregate Paydowns was equal to or greater than million, the maturity date of the SSTL may be extended at the Company s option to April 30, 2026. Such extension is conditioned upon the Company s payment of a payment-in-kind extension fee on or before April 30, 2025 and subject to the representations and warranties being true and correct as of such date and there being no default or event of default being in existence as of such date. 
 All amounts outstanding under the SSTL will become due on the earlier of (i) the maturity date, and (ii) the date on which the loans are declared to be due and owing by the administrative agent at the request (or with the consent) of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement; other capitalized terms, unless defined herein, are defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) or as otherwise provided in the Amended Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any event of default. There are no mandatory repayments of the SSTL, except as set forth herein, until the April 30, 2025 maturity when the balance is due. If the maturity date is extended to April 30, 2026, the Company is required to make mandatory repayments of million in the first quarter of 2026 with the remaining balance due at the April 2026 maturity. 
 In addition to the scheduled principal payments, subject to certain exceptions, the SSTL is subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, certain casualty and condemnation events and sales of assets, as well as of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 Altisource may incur incremental indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement from or more incremental lenders, which may include existing lenders, in an aggregate incremental principal amount not to exceed million, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. The lenders have no obligation to provide any incremental indebtedness. 
 Through March 29, 2023, the SSTL s interest rate was the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus . Beginning March 30, 2023, the SSTL bears interest at rates based upon, at our option, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or the Base Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. SOFR-based term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to SOFR plus payable in cash plus a payable in kind PIK component. Base Rate-based term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus payable in cash plus a PIK component. The PIK component of the interest rate was subject to adjustment based on the amount of Aggregate Paydowns. Since Aggregate Paydowns were million in the first quarter of 2023 and an additional million in the third quarter of 2023, the PIK component was for the period March 30, 2023 
 14

 for periods thereafter. The interest rate as of September 30, 2024, including the PIK component, was . 
 If, as of the end of any calendar quarter, (i) the amount of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents of Altisource S. r.l. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis plus (ii) the undrawn commitment amount under the Revolver is, or is forecast as of the end of the immediately subsequent calendar quarter to be, less than million, then up to in interest otherwise payable in cash in the following quarter may be paid in kind at the Company s election. 
 The payment of all amounts owing by Altisource under the Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Guarantors and is secured by a pledge of all equity interests of certain subsidiaries of Altisource, as well as a lien on substantially all of the assets of Altisource S. r.l. and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement includes covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, to incur indebtedness; incur liens on our assets; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; make Restricted Junior Payments including share repurchases, dividends and repayment of junior indebtedness; make investments; dispose of equity interests of any Material Subsidiaries; engage in a line of business substantially different than existing businesses and businesses reasonably related, complimentary or ancillary thereto; amend material debt agreements or other material contracts; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; grant negative pledges or agree to such other restrictions relating to subsidiary dividends and distributions; make changes to our fiscal year; and engage in mergers and consolidations. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain events of default including (i) failure to pay principal when due or interest or any other amount owing on any other obligation under the Amended Credit Agreement within of becoming due, (ii) material incorrectness of representations and warranties when made, (iii) breach of certain other covenants, subject to cure periods described in the Amended Credit Agreement, (iv) failure to pay principal or interest on any other debt that equals or exceeds million when due, (v) default on any other debt that equals or exceeds million that causes, or gives the holder or holders of such debt the ability to cause, an acceleration of such debt, (vi) occurrence of a Change of Control, (vii) bankruptcy and insolvency events, (viii) entry by a court of one or more judgments against us in an aggregate amount in excess of million that remain unbonded, undischarged or unstayed for a certain number of days after the entry thereof, (ix) the occurrence of certain ERISA events, (x) the failure of certain Loan Documents to be in full force and effect and (xi) failure to comply in any material respects with the terms of the Warrants or the Warrant Purchase Agreement. If any event of default occurs and is not cured within applicable grace periods set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement or waived, all loans and other obligations could become due and immediately payable and the facility could be terminated. 
 The lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement received Warrants to purchase shares of Altisource common stock. The number of Warrant Shares is subject to reduction based on the amount of Aggregate Paydowns (see Note 11 for additional information). The fair value of the Warrants on February 14, 2023 was million and was recorded as an increase in debt discount. 
 In connection with Amendment No. 2, the Company paid million to the lenders and to third parties on behalf of the lenders. The million payment was recorded as an increase in debt issuance and amendment costs.

 Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are carried at amounts that approximate their fair values due to the highly liquid nature of these instruments and are measured using Level 1 inputs. 
 The fair value of our SSTL is based on quoted market prices. Based on the frequency of trading, we do not believe that there is an active market for our debt. Therefore, the quoted prices are considered Level 2 inputs. 
 Our Revolving Loan Agreement was measured using Level 3 inputs based on the present value of the future payments. As quoted market price is not available and there is no trading, we believe that the contractual interest rate represents the market rate at the measurement date and therefore the fair value equals the Revolving Loan Agreement book value. 
 In connection with the sale of Pointillist on December 1, 2021, million was deposited into an escrow account to satisfy certain indemnification claims that may arise on or prior to the first anniversary of the sale closing. The deposit was recorded as a short-term receivable. We measure short-term receivables without a stated interest rate based on the present value of the future payments. 
 There were no transfers between different levels during the periods presented. 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our policy is to deposit our cash and cash equivalents with larger, highly rated financial institutions. The Company derived and of its revenue from Onity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively (see Note 2 for additional information on Onity revenues and accounts receivable balance). The Company strives to mitigate its concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable by actively monitoring past due accounts and the economic status of larger customers, if known.

We recognized share-based compensation expense of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively million and million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively). As of September 30, 2024, estimated unrecognized compensation costs related to share-based awards amounted to million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of approximately years. 
 Stock Options 
 Stock option grants are composed of a combination of service-based, market-based and performance-based options. 
 Service-Based Options. These options generally vest over three or with equal annual vesting and generally expire on the earlier of after the date of grant or following termination of service. A total of thousand service-based options were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Market-Based Options . These option grants generally have components, each of which vests only upon the achievement of certain criteria. The first component, which we refer to as ordinary performance grants, generally consists of two-thirds of the market-based grant and begins to vest if the stock price is at least double the exercise price, as long as the stock price realizes a compounded annual gain of at least over the exercise price. The remaining third of the market-based options, which we refer to as extraordinary performance grants, generally begins to vest if the stock price is at least triple the exercise price, as long as the stock price realizes a compounded annual gain of at least over the exercise price. Market-based options generally vest in three or installments with the first installment vesting upon the achievement of the criteria and the remaining installments vesting thereafter in equal annual installments. Market-based options generally expire on the earlier of after the date of grant or following termination of service, unless the performance criteria is met prior to termination of service or in the final of the option term, in which case vesting will generally continue in accordance with the provisions of the award agreement. A total of thousand market-based options were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Performance-Based Options. These option grants generally will vest if certain specific financial measures are achieved; typically with one-fourth vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. The award of performance-based options is adjusted based on the level of achievement specified in the award agreements. If the performance criteria achieved is above threshold performance levels, participants generally have the opportunity to vest in to of the option grants, depending upon performance achieved. If the performance criteria achieved is below a certain threshold, the options are canceled. The options generally expire on the earlier of after the date of grant or following termination of service, unless the performance criteria is met prior to termination of service in which case vesting will generally continue in accordance with the provisions of the award agreement. There were thousand performance-based options outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 There were stock option grants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The fair values of the performance-based options are determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 We determined the expected option life of all service-based stock option grants using the simplified method, determined based on the graded vesting term plus the contractual term of the options, divided by two. We use the simplified method because we believe that our historical data does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected option life.

Additionally, of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of our revenue for the third quarter of 2024) was earned on the loan portfolios serviced by Onity, when a party other than Onity or the MSRs owner selected Altisource as the service provider. 
 Onity has disclosed that it is subject to a number of ongoing regulatory examinations, orders, inquiries, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, requests for information and other actions and is subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings, some of which include claims against Onity for substantial monetary damages. Previous regulatory actions against Onity have subjected Onity to independent oversight of its operations and placed certain restrictions on its ability to acquire servicing rights or proceed with default-related actions on the loans it services. Existing or future similar matters could result in adverse regulatory or other actions against Onity. In addition to the above, Onity may become subject to future adverse regulatory or other actions. 
 Onity has disclosed that Rithm is one of its largest servicing clients. As of June 30, 2024, Onity reported that approximately of loans serviced and subserviced by Onity (measured in UPB) and approximately of all delinquent loans that Onity services were related to Rithm MSRs or rights to MSRs. 
 The existence or outcome of Onity regulatory matters or the termination of Onity s sub-servicing agreements with Rithm, or other significant Onity clients may have significant adverse effects on Onity s business. For example, Onity may be required to alter the way it conducts business, including the parties it contracts with for services, it may be required to seek changes to its existing pricing structure with us, it may lose its non-government-sponsored enterprise GSE servicing rights or subservicing arrangements or may lose one or more of its state servicing or origination licenses. Additional regulatory actions or adverse financial developments may impose additional restrictions on or require changes in Onity s business that could require it to sell assets or change its business operations. Any or all of these effects and others could result in our eventual loss of Onity as a customer or a reduction in the number and/or volume of services it purchases from us or the loss of other customers. 
 If any of the following events occurred, Altisource s revenue could be significantly reduced and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including from the possible impairment or write-off of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, other assets and accounts receivable: 
 Altisource loses Onity as a customer or there is a significant reduction in the volume of services it purchases from us 
 Onity loses, sells or transfers a significant portion of its GSE or Federal Housing Administration servicing rights or subservicing arrangements or remaining other servicing rights or subservicing arrangements and Altisource fails to be retained as a service provider 
 The contractual relationship between Onity and Rithm changes significantly, including Onity s sub-servicing arrangement with Rithm expiring without renewal, and this change results in a change in our status as a provider of services related to the Subject MSRs 
 Onity loses state servicing licenses in states with a significant number of loans in Onity s servicing portfolio 
 Onity is subject to stays, moratoriums, suspensions or other restrictions that limit or delay default-related actions on the loans it services 
 The contractual relationship between Onity and Altisource changes significantly or there are significant changes to our pricing to Onity for services from which we generate material revenue 
 Altisource otherwise fails to be retained as a service provider.

 Our Lenders One business includes management services provided to the Best Partners Mortgage Cooperative, Inc., doing business as Lenders One Lenders One ), and certain loan manufacturing and capital markets services provided to the members of the Lenders One cooperative. 
 Technology and SaaS Products 
 Our Technology and SaaS Products business includes Vendorly Monitor (a vendor management platform), Lenders One Loan Automation LOLA (a marketplace to order services and a tool to automate components of the loan manufacturing process), TrelixAI TM (technology to manage the workflow and automate components of the loan fulfillment, pre and post-close quality control and service transfer processes), and ADMS (a document management and data analytics delivery platform). 
 Corporate and Others includes interest expense and costs related to corporate functions including executive, infrastructure and certain technology groups, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, facilities, risk management and eliminations between reportable segments. 
 We classify revenue in three categories: service revenue, revenue from reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests. In evaluating our performance, we focus on service revenue. Service revenue consists of amounts attributable to our fee-based services. Reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests are pass-through items for which we earn no margin. Reimbursable expenses consist of amounts we incur on behalf of our customers in performing our fee-based services that we pass directly on to our customers without a markup. Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Lenders One. Lenders One is a mortgage cooperative managed, but not owned, by Altisource. The Lenders One members earnings are included in revenue and reduced from net loss to arrive at net loss attributable to Altisource. 
 Strategy and Core Businesses 
 We are focused on becoming the premier provider of mortgage and real estate marketplaces and related technology enabled solutions to a broad and diversified customer base of residential real estate and loan investors, servicers, and originators. The real estate and mortgage marketplaces represent very large markets, and we believe our scale and suite of offerings provide us with competitive advantages that could support our growth. As we navigate the continuing unsettled nature of the housing and mortgage servicing markets in the wake of governmental mandates taken in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and other macro-economic trends, we continue to evaluate our strategy and core businesses and seek to position our businesses to provide long term value to our customers and shareholders. 
 Each of our business segments provides Altisource the potential to grow and diversify our customer and revenue base. We believe these business segments address very large markets and directly leverage our core competencies and distinct competitive advantages. Our business segments and strategic initiatives follow: 
 Servicer and Real Estate: 
 Through our offerings that support residential real estate and loan investors and forward and reverse servicers, we provide a suite of solutions and technologies intended to meet their growing and evolving needs. We are focused on growing referrals from our existing customer base and attracting new customers to our offerings. We have a customer base that includes government-sponsored enterprises GSEs ), asset managers, and several large bank and non-bank servicers including Onity and Rithm. We believe we are one of only a few providers with a broad suite of solutions, nationwide coverage and scalability. Further, we believe we are well positioned to gain market share from existing and new customers if they consolidate to larger, full-service providers or outsource services that have historically been performed in-house. 
 Origination: 
 Through our offerings that support mortgage loan originators (or other similar mortgage market participants), we provide a suite of solutions and technologies to meet the evolving and growing needs of lenders, mortgage purchasers and securitizers. We are focused on growing business from our existing customer base, attracting new customers to our offerings and developing new offerings. We have a customer base that includes the Lenders One cooperative members, which includes independent mortgage bankers, credit unions, and banks, as well as bank and non-bank loan originators. We believe our suite of services, technologies and unique access to the members of the Lenders One mortgage cooperative position us to grow our relationships with our existing customer base by growing membership of Lenders One, increasing member adoption of existing solutions and developing and cross-selling new offerings. Further, we believe we are well positioned to gain market share from existing and new customers as customers and prospects look to Lenders One to help them improve their profitability and better compete.

 COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts 
 Actions taken by federal, state and local governments, GSEs and mortgage servicers in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic continue to have a profound impact on our business, our customers, and the industries in which we operate. Despite the expiration of certain such measures, we believe servicers are proceeding slowly with foreclosure initiations for borrowers in default and foreclosure initiations may not convert to foreclosure sales and REO at the same rate or pace as prior to the pandemic due to improved home equity and borrower relief options. The decline in foreclosure initiations and foreclosure sales throughout the pandemic, partially offset by the restart of the default market, significantly decreased default related referrals to Altisource and continue to negatively impact virtually all of Altisource s default related services revenue. 
 While we cannot predict whether the default market will return to a pre-pandemic operating environment, we believe the demand for our Default business will grow. We estimate that in today s environment it typically takes on average two years to convert foreclosure initiations to foreclosure sales and six months to market and sell the REO. The foreclosure timelines could vary significantly based upon, for example, upon the state where the property is located and whether the foreclosure is contested. The REO sale timelines could also vary significantly based upon, for example, the local real estate market, whether the home is located in a redemption state and whether the home is occupied post foreclosure. 
 During 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to address lower revenue, we worked to (1) reduce our cost structure, (2) maintain the infrastructure to deliver default related services for our customer base and support the anticipated increase in demand following the expiration of the moratoriums and forbearance plans and CFPB s rules on temporary loss mitigation measures, and (3) add new Lenders One members, launch new solutions and increase customer adoption of our solutions to accelerate the growth of our origination business. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On May 16, 2023, our shareholders approved the renewal and amendment of the share repurchase program previously approved by the shareholders on May 15, 2018. Under the program, we are authorized to purchase up to 3.1 million shares of our common stock, based on a limit of 15 of the outstanding shares of common stock on the date of approval, at a minimum price of 1.00 per share and a maximum price of 25.00 per share, for a period of five years from the date of approval. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock remain available for repurchase under the program. There were no purchases of shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Luxembourg law limits share repurchases to the balance of Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (unconsolidated parent company) retained earnings, less the value of shares repurchased. As of September 30, 2024, we can repurchase up to approximately 114 million of our common stock under Luxembourg law. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we are not permitted to repurchase shares except for limited circumstances. 
 Onity Related Matters 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Onity was our largest customer, accounting for 43 and 44 respectively, of our total revenue. Additionally, 6 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (6 of our revenue for the third quarter of 2024) was earned on the loan portfolios serviced by Onity, when a party other than Onity or the mortgage servicing rights MSRs owner selected Altisource as the service provider. 
 Onity has disclosed that it is subject to a number of ongoing regulatory examinations, orders, inquiries, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, requests for information and other actions and is subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings, some of which include claims against Onity for substantial monetary damages. Previous regulatory actions against Onity have subjected Onity to independent oversight of its operations and placed certain restrictions on its ability to acquire servicing rights or proceed with default-related actions on the loans it services. Existing or future similar matters could result in adverse regulatory or other actions against Onity. In addition to the above, Onity may become subject to future adverse regulatory or other actions. 
 Onity has disclosed that Rithm is one of its largest servicing clients. As of June 30, 2024, Onity reported that approximately 14 of loans serviced and subserviced by Onity (measured in UPB) and approximately 64 of all delinquent loans that Onity services were related to Rithm MSRs or rights to MSRs. 
 The existence or outcome of Onity regulatory matters or the termination of Onity s sub-servicing agreements with Rithm or other significant Onity clients may have significant adverse effects on Onity s business. For example, Onity may be required to

Table of Contents 

 alter the way it conducts business, including the parties it contracts with for services, it may be required to seek changes to its existing pricing structure with us, it may lose its non-GSE servicing rights or subservicing arrangements or may lose one or more of its state servicing or origination licenses. Additional regulatory actions or adverse financial developments may impose additional restrictions on or require changes in Onity s business that could require it to sell assets or change its business operations. Any or all of these effects and others could result in our eventual loss of Onity as a customer or a reduction in the number and/or volume of services it purchases from us or the loss of other customers. 
 If any of the following events occurred, Altisource s revenue could be significantly reduced and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including from the possible impairment or write-off of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, other assets and accounts receivable: 
 Altisource loses Onity as a customer or there is a significant reduction in the volume of services it purchases from us 
 Onity loses, sells or transfers a significant portion of its GSE or Federal Housing Administration servicing rights or subservicing arrangements or remaining other servicing rights or subservicing arrangements and Altisource fails to be retained as a service provider 
 The contractual relationship between Onity and Rithm changes significantly, including Onity s sub-servicing arrangement with Rithm expiring without renewal, and this change results in a change in our status as a provider of services related to the Subject MSRs 
 Onity loses state servicing licenses in states with a significant number of loans in Onity s servicing portfolio 
 Onity is subject to stays, moratoriums, suspensions or other restrictions that limit or delay default-related actions on the loans it services 
 The contractual relationship between Onity and Altisource changes significantly or there are significant changes to our pricing to Onity for services from which we generate material revenue 
 Altisource otherwise fails to be retained as a service provider and/or there is a reduction in referral volumes 
 The foregoing list is not intended to be exhaustive. Management cannot predict whether any of these events or other events will occur or the amount of any impact they may have on Altisource. We are seeking to diversify and grow our revenue and customer base and we have a sales and marketing strategy to support these efforts. Moreover, in the event one or more of these events materially negatively impact Altisource, we believe the variable nature of our cost structure would allow us to realign our cost structure to address some of the impact to revenue and that current liquidity would be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other cash needs. There can be no assurance that our plans will be successful or our operations will be profitable. 
 Factors Affecting Comparability 
 The following items impact the comparability of our results: 
 Industrywide foreclosure initiations were 7 lower for the eight months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (and 34 lower than the same pre-COVID-19 period in 2019) 
 Industrywide foreclosure sales were 14 lower for the eight months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (and 54 lower than the same pre-COVID-19 period in 2019) 
 Industrywide mortgage origination volume increased by 1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 
 Temporary delay in certain California foreclosures during the three months ended June 30, 2023 negatively impacted revenue in the Servicer and Real Estate segment 
 The interest rate on the Company s senior secured term loans was 14.18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.44 for the same period in 2023 
 On February 14, 2023, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Altisource S. r.l., entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement. In connection with Amendment No. 2, the Company paid 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to advisors and recorded these payments as other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (no comparative amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024) 
 The Company recognized an income tax provision of 2.2 million and 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively 0.8 million and 0.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively). The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by income tax expense on transfer pricing income from India and the United States, no tax benefit on the pretax loss from our Luxembourg operating company, and uncertain tax positions.

 Revenue 
 We recognized service revenue of 111.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 7 increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 38.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 12 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023). The increase in service revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by higher revenue in both segments. Revenue was higher in the Servicer and Real Estate segment from growth in our field services, foreclosure trustee and property renovation services businesses in the Solutions business, partially offset by 0.8 million of first quarter 2023 non-recurring professional services revenue in the Equator business within the Technology and SaaS Products business and fewer home sales in the Marketplace business. Revenue was higher in the Origination segment from growth of reseller products in the Lenders One business. 
 We recognized reimbursable expenses revenue of 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an 11 increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 2.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 14 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023). The increase in reimbursable expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher-value REO title related expenses in the Solutions business within the Servicer and Real Estate segment. The increase in reimbursable expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in property preservation services in the Solutions business within the Servicer and Real Estate segment. 
 Certain of our revenues can be impacted by seasonality. More specifically, revenues from property sales, loan originations and certain property preservation services in field services typically tend to be at their lowest level during the fall and winter months and at their highest level during the spring and summer months. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures and the rapid rise in mortgage interest rates, the seasonal impact to revenue may not follow historical patterns. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue principally includes payroll and employee benefits associated with personnel employed in customer service, operations and technology roles, fees paid to external providers related to the provision of services, reimbursable expenses, technology and telecommunications costs as well as depreciation and amortization of operating assets. 
 Cost of revenue consists of the following: 
 Three months ended September 30, 
 Nine months ended September 30, 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Increase (decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (decrease) Outside fees and services 15,534 13,659 14 44,301 42,810 3 Compensation and benefits 7,457 9,090 (18) 21,913 28,072 (22) Technology and telecommunications 3,026 3,786 (20) 8,256 11,048 (25) Reimbursable expenses 2,321 2,039 14 7,081 6,398 11 Depreciation and amortization 123 450 (73) 479 1,356 (65) Cost of revenue 28,461 29,024 (2) 82,030 89,684 (9) 
 We recognized cost of revenue of 82.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 9 decrease compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 28.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 2 decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023). Compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to efficiency initiatives and cost savings measures taken in 2023. Technology and telecommunications for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to lower overall headcount. Outside fees and services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily from higher revenue in the Solutions business within the Servicer and Real Estate segment partially offset by lower outside fees and services in the Origination segment from a change in revenue mix. In addition, changes in reimbursable expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are consistent with the changes in reimbursable expenses revenue discussed in the revenue section above. 
 Gross profit increased to 37.1 million, representing 33 of service revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.2 million, representing 20 of service revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (increased to 12.1 million, representing 32 of service revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 7.2 million, representing 21 of service revenue, for the third quarter of 2023). Gross profit as a percentage of service revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to margin expansion in both the Servicer and Real Estate segment and the Origination segment from efficiency initiatives and lower corporate costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by service revenue mix in the Servicer and Real Estate segment.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses includes payroll for personnel employed in executive, sales and marketing, finance, technology, law, compliance, audit, human resources, vendor management, facilities and risk management roles. This category also includes professional services fees, occupancy costs, marketing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-operating assets and other expenses. 
 SG A expenses consist of the following: 
 Three months ended September 30, 
 Nine months ended September 30, 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Increase (decrease) 2024 2023 Increase (decrease) Compensation and benefits 4,413 4,906 (10) 14,765 16,312 (9) Professional services 2,547 1,897 34 7,160 5,743 25 Amortization of intangible assets 1,270 1,352 (6) 3,810 3,912 (3) Occupancy related costs 801 1,266 (37) 2,776 3,924 (29) Marketing costs 489 440 11 1,536 1,381 11 Depreciation and amortization 99 129 (23) 315 577 (45) Other 1,346 744 81 4,089 3,320 23 Selling, general and administrative expenses 10,965 10,734 2 34,451 35,169 (2) 
 SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 34.5 million decreased by 2 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 11.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 2 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023). The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by lower compensation and benefits and occupancy related costs, partially offset by higher professional services. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher professional services, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits and occupancy related costs. Compensation and benefits and occupancy related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from efficiency and cost reductions measures. Professional services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to accruals for potential settlements of certain legacy indemnity claims and estimated legal matters. 
 Income (loss) from operations 
 Income (loss) from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million, representing 2 of service revenue, compared to (13.9) million, representing (13) of service revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 1.1 million, representing 3 of service revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to (3.5) million representing (10) of service revenue for the third quarter of 2023). Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of service revenue improved for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher gross profit margins and lower SG A expenses as a percentage of service revenue. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net principally includes interest expense and other non-operating gains and losses. 
 Other income (expense), net was (27.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (26.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (9.6) million for the third quarter of 2024 and (7.3) million for the third quarter of 2023). The change for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher interest expense and a gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (no comparable amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024), partially offset by lower debt amendment costs. The higher interest expense was driven by higher interest rates on our amended SSTL. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 We recognized an income tax provision of 2.2 million and 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively 0.8 million and 0.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively). The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by income tax expense on transfer pricing income from India and the United States, no tax benefit on the pretax loss from our Luxembourg operating company, and uncertain tax positions.

 We recognized service revenue of 88.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an 8 increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 30.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 13 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023). We also recognized reimbursable expenses revenue of 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 13 increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 2.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 20 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023). The increase in service revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by growth in our field services, property renovation services and foreclosure trustee businesses in the Solutions business, partially offset by fewer home sales in the Marketplace business. The increase in service revenue for the nine months ended was also partially offset by 0.8 million of first quarter 2023 non-recurring professional services revenue in the Equator business within the Technology and SaaS Products business. 
 Certain of our Servicer and Real Estate businesses are impacted by seasonality. Revenues from property sales and certain property preservation services are generally lowest during the fall and winter months and highest during the spring and summer months. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures and the rapid rise in mortgage interest rates the seasonal impact to revenue may not follow historical patterns.

 Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 58.4 million increased by 4 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 20.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 12 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023). The increase in cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by higher outside fees and services from higher revenue in the field services, property renovation services and foreclosure trustee businesses in the Solutions business and higher reimbursable expenses, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits from efficiency initiatives and cost savings measures.

 Gross profit increased to 36.8 million, representing 42 of service revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 31.4 million, representing 39 of service revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (increased to 12.0 million, representing 40 of service revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 10.4 million, representing 39 of service revenue, for the third quarter of 2023). Gross profit as a percentage of service revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to price increases for certain services and efficiency initiatives and cost savings measures partially offset by a change in revenue mix from fewer homes sold in our higher margin Hubzu business and growth in the lower margin Field Services and recently launched Renovation businesses. Our margins can vary substantially depending upon the service revenue mix.

 SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 8.7 million increased by 26 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 3.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 62 increase compared to the third quarter of 2023). The increase in SG A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to higher professional services and other expenses, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits. Professional services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to accruals for potential settlements of certain legacy indemnity claims. Other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from higher bad debt expense. Compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from efficiency and cost reduction measures. 
 Income from operations 
 Income from operations increased to 28.1 million, representing 32 of service revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.5 million, representing 30 of service revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (increased to 8.8 million, representing 29 of service revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.4 million, representing 31 of service revenue for the third quarter of 2023). The increase in operating income as a percentage of service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of higher gross profit margins, partially offset by higher SG A expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of service revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of higher SG A expenses.

The decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by lower occupancy related costs and compensation and benefits driven by efficiency initiatives and cost savings measures. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net principally includes interest expense and other non-operating gains and losses. 
 Other income (expense), net was (27.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (26.5) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (9.6) million for the third quarter of 2024 and (7.3) million for the third quarter of 2023). The change for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher interest expense and a gain on the change in fair value of the warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (no comparable amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024), partially offset by lower debt amendment costs. The higher interest expense was driven by higher interest rates on our amended SSTL. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations, cash proceeds from sales of businesses, cash proceeds from the sale of equity securities and cash on hand. However, due to governmental and market responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue has declined significantly compared to pre-pandemic levels. The lower revenue, partially offset by efficiency initiatives and cost savings measures, resulted in negative operating cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We believe our anticipated revenue growth from the return of the default market, on-boarding sales wins, and revenue mix together with our reduced cost structure, should help reduce negative operating cash flow. We seek to deploy cash generated in a disciplined manner. Principally, we intend to use cash to develop and grow complementary services and businesses that we believe will generate attractive margins in line with our core capabilities and strategy and fund negative operating cash flow. We also use cash for repayments of our long-term debt and capital investments. In addition, from time to time we consider and evaluate business acquisitions, dispositions, closures, sales of equity securities or other similar actions that are aligned with our strategy.

 Senior Secured Term Loans 
 In April 2018, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Altisource S. r.l., entered into a credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain lenders (the Credit Agreement ). Under the Credit Agreement, Altisource borrowed 412 million in the form of senior secured term loans SSTL ). Effective February 14, 2023, Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and Altisource S. r.l. entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (as amended by Amendment No. 2, the Amended Credit Agreement ). Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. and its subsidiaries, subject to the applicable exclusions in the Amended Credit Agreement, are guarantors on the SSTL (collectively, the Guarantors ). Effective June 1, 2023, the administrative agent and collateral agent of the Amended Credit Agreement changed to Wilmington Trust, N.A. 
 The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is April 30, 2025. Since Aggregate Paydowns under the Amended Credit Agreement were equal to or greater than 30 million, the maturity date of the SSTL may be extended at the Company s option to April 30, 2026 (subject to the representations and warranties being true and correct as of such date and there being no default or event of default being in existence as of such date). Such extension is conditioned upon the Company s payment of a 2 payment-in-kind extension fee on or before April 30, 2025. 
 All amounts outstanding under the SSTL become due on the earlier of (i) the maturity date, and (ii) the date on which the loans are declared to be due and owing by the administrative agent at the request (or with the consent) of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement; other capitalized terms, unless defined herein, are defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) or as otherwise provided in the Amended Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any event of default. There are no mandatory repayments of the SSTL, except as set forth herein, until the April 30, 2025 maturity when the balance is due. If the maturity date is extended to April 30, 2026, the Company is required to make mandatory repayments of 5.2 million in the first quarter of 2026 with the remaining balance due at the April 2026 maturity. 
 In addition to the scheduled principal payments, subject to certain exceptions, the SSTL is subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, certain casualty and condemnation events and sales of assets, as well as from 50 of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 Altisource may incur incremental indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement from one or more incremental lenders, which may include existing lenders, in an aggregate incremental principal amount not to exceed 50 million, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. The lenders have no obligation to provide any incremental indebtedness. 
 Through March 29, 2023, the SSTL s interest rate was the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 4.00 . Beginning March 30, 2023, the SSTL bears interest at rates based upon, at our option, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or the Base Rate, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. SOFR-based term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to SOFR plus 5.00 payable in cash plus a payable in kind PIK component. Base Rate-based term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 4.00 payable in cash plus a PIK component. The PIK component of the interest rate was subject to adjustment based on the amount of Aggregate Paydowns. Since Aggregate Paydowns were 20 million in the first quarter of 2023 and an additional 10 million in the third quarter of 2023, the PIK component was 4.50 for the period March 30, 2023 through June 30, 2023 and 3.75 for periods thereafter. The interest rate as of September 30, 2024, including the PIK component, was 14.18 . 
 If, as of the end of any calendar quarter, (i) the amount of unencumbered cash and cash equivalents of Altisource S. r.l. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis plus (ii) the undrawn commitment amount under the Revolver is, or is forecast as of the end of the immediately subsequent calendar quarter to be, less than 35 million, then up to 2.00 in interest otherwise payable in cash in the following quarter may be paid in kind at the Company s election. 
 The payment of all amounts owing by Altisource under the Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Guarantors and is secured by a pledge of all equity interests of certain subsidiaries of Altisource, as well as a lien on substantially all of the assets of Altisource S. r.l. and the Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement includes covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, to incur additional debt, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we are not permitted to repurchase shares except for limited circumstances. In the event we require additional liquidity, our ability to obtain it may be limited by the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the SSTL was 230.6 million.

Deer Park owns approximately 16 of Altisource s common stock as of September 30, 2024 and owns Altisource debt as a lender under the Amended Credit Agreement.

The Amended Revolver provides Altisource the ability to borrow a maximum amount of 15.0 million. Amounts that are repaid may be re-borrowed in accordance with the limitations set forth below. 
 The maturity date of the Amended Revolver coincides with the maturity date of the SSTL under the Amended Credit Agreement, as it may be extended. The outstanding balance on the Amended Revolver is due and payable on such maturity date. 
 Borrowings under the Amended Revolver bear interest of 10.00 per annum in cash and 3.00 per annum PIK and are payable quarterly on the last business day of each March, June, September and December. In connection with the Amended Revolver, Altisource is required to pay a usage fee equal to 0.75 million at the initial extension of credit pursuant to the Amended Revolver. 
 Altisource s obligations under the Amended Revolver are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company, which lien will be pari passu with liens securing the SSTL under the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 The Amended Revolver contains additional representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type, that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to use the proceeds of credit only for general corporate purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding debt under the Amended Revolver, and since amending the Revolver, the Company has not borrowed any amount under the Amended Revolver. 
 Revolving Loan Agreement 
 In connection with the Company s residential real estate renovation services business, on June 3, 2024 Altisource Solutions, Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A, entered into a revolving loan agreement with a related party, Altisource Asset Management Corporation AAMC (the Revolving Loan Agreement ). 
 Under the terms of the Revolving Loan Agreement, AAMC will make loans to Altisource from time to time, as may be requested by Altisource. The Revolving Loan Agreement provides Altisource the ability to borrow an initial aggregate amount of up to 1.0 million, with the potential for this to be increased up to 3.0 million at the option of AAMC. Amounts that are repaid may be re-borrowed in accordance with the limitations set forth below. 
 The maturity date of the Revolving Loan Agreement is June 3, 2025 and may be automatically extended for one year on each anniversary of the maturity date. During any extension period, AAMC may terminate the Revolving Loan Agreement upon 150 days prior written notice and the loan will mature upon such termination. The outstanding balance on the Revolving Loan Agreement is due and payable on such maturity date. 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Loan Agreement bear interest of 12.00 per annum in cash and are payable monthly in arrears on the first business day of each calendar month. Altisource will pay AAMC a monthly unused commitment fee in an amount equal to 0.25 per annum of the average amount of the unused available credit under the Revolving Loan Agreement. 
 Altisource s obligation under the Revolving Loan Agreement is secured by certain receivables related to the Company s residential real estate renovation services business. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 250 thousand outstanding debt under the Revolving Loan Agreement.

The improvement in cash used in operating activities was driven by an 18.4 million improvement in net loss adjusted for non-cash items included in the determination of net loss (PIK interest, stock based compensation, change in the fair value of warrant liability, bad debt expense, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, amortization of debt discount, amortization of debt issuance and amendment costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets). This was partially offset by a 4.4 million decrease in cash provided by working capital from the 1.4 million net payment of taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 4.0 million net collection of taxes receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a 2.0 million return of surety bonds in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating cash flows can be negatively impacted because of the nature of some of our services and the mix of services provided. Certain services are performed immediately following or shortly after the referral, but the collection of the receivable does not occur until a specific event occurs (e.g., the foreclosure is complete, the REO asset is sold, etc.). Furthermore, lower margin services generate lower income and cash flows from operations. Consequently, our cash flows from operations may be negatively impacted when comparing one period to another. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities were (0.6) million and 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made payments of 0.7 million and 0.5 million, respectively, to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations on the issuance of restricted share units and restricted shares. These payments were made to tax authorities, at the employees direction, to satisfy the employees tax obligations rather than issuing a portion of vested restricted share units and restricted shares to employees. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we distributed 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, to non-controlling interests. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received proceeds from the issuance of short-term debt of 0.3 million in connection with borrowings under the Revolving Loan Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 20.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs, received 18.4 million in proceeds from the sale of treasury stock, net of issuance costs and used 30.0 million of the proceeds for repayment of debt. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid 4.9 million to lenders or others on behalf of the lenders related to the debt amendment.

 Future Uses of Cash 
 Our significant future liquidity obligations primarily pertain to the maturity of the SSTL under the Amended Credit Agreement, interest expense under the Amended Credit Agreement (see Liquidity section above), and operating lease payments on certain of our premises and equipment. 
 Significant future uses of cash include the following: 
 Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total 2024 2025-2026 2027-2029 Senior secured term loans (1) 
 235,741 235,741 Revolving loan agreement (2) 
 250 250 Interest expense payments (3) 
 13,329 5,718 7,611 Lease payments 2,929 400 2,269 260 Total 252,249 6,118 245,871 260 
 ______________________________________ 
 (1) The outstanding balance of our SSTL as of September 30, 2024 is 230.6 million and is due on April 30, 2025. Since Aggregate Paydowns were equal to or greater than 30 million, the maturity date of the SSTL may be extended at the Company s option to April 30, 2026 (subject to a payment of a 2 payment-in-kind extension fee on or before April 30, 2025 and subject to the representations and warranties being true and correct as of such date and there being no default or event of default being in existence as of such date). The table herein reflects a maturity of April 2025. The increase in outstanding balance is from the PIK component of our interest expense and is assumed to be paid in kind through the April 2025 maturity date. 
 (2) The outstanding balance of our Revolving Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2024 is 250 thousand and is due on June 3, 2025, and may be automatically extended for one year on each anniversary of the maturity date. The table herein reflects a maturity of June 3, 2025. 
 (3) Estimated future interest payments based on the SOFR interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and the April 30, 2025 maturity date. Based on the April 30, 2025 maturity date, no interest expense has been included beyond April 30, 2025. 
 We anticipate funding future liquidity requirements with a combination of existing cash balances, cash anticipated to be generated by operating activities and, as needed, proceeds from the Amended Revolver. For further information, see Note 10 and Note 21 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of escrow and certain other account arrangements. 
 We hold customers assets in escrow and other accounts at various financial institutions pending completion of certain real estate and construction review activities. These amounts are held in escrow and other accounts for limited periods of time and are not included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amounts held in escrow and other accounts were 19.0 million and 21.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations from those identified in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and this Form 10-Q, other than those that occur in the normal course of business. See Note 21 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 We prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and judgments, however, are often subjective. Actual results may be negatively affected based on changing circumstances. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.

Table of Contents 

 Our critical accounting policies are described in the MD A section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Recently Adopted and Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including pronouncements that were adopted in the current period. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 Our financial market risk consists primarily of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the initial interest rate charged on the SSTL is SOFR (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), with a minimum floor of 1.00 , plus 5.00 paid in cash plus 5.00 PIK. Based on par paydowns of 30 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, the PIK component was reduced to 3.75 . 
 Based on the principal amount outstanding and SOFR as of September 30, 2024, a one percentage point increase in SOFR above the minimum floor would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 2.3 million. There would be a 2.3 million decrease in our annual interest expense if there was a one percentage point decrease in SOFR. 
 Currency Exchange Risk 
 We are exposed to currency risk from potential changes in currency values of our non-United States dollar denominated expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows. Our most significant currency exposure relates to the Indian rupee. Based on expenses incurred in Indian rupees for the third quarter of 2024, a one percentage point increase or decrease in value of the Indian rupee in relation to the United States dollar would increase or decrease our annual expenses by approximately 0.1 million. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, such officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 b) Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We record a liability for contingencies if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, including expected insurance coverage. For proceedings where the reasonable estimate of loss is a range, we record a best estimate of loss within the range. 
 Litigation 
 We are currently involved in legal actions in the course of our business, most of which seek monetary damages. Although the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that their outcome, both individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Periodically, we are subject to audits, examinations and investigations by governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority. We are currently responding to such inquiries from governmental authorities relating to certain aspects of our business. We believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with these inquiries. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 There were no purchases of shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. On May 16, 2023, our shareholders approved the renewal and amendment of the share repurchase program previously approved by the shareholders on May 15, 2018. Under the program, we are authorized to purchase up to 3.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market, subject to certain parameters, for a period of five years from the date of approval. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the repurchase program is 3.1 million shares of the Company s common stock. In addition to the share repurchase program, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, 33,610 common shares were withheld from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations that arose from the vesting of restricted shares. 
 On February 20, 2024, the Company issued a total of 232,580 Restricted share units RSUs as equity compensation under the Altisource 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan to the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Legal and Compliance Officer as unregistered securities in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 Director and Officer Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company , modified or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
