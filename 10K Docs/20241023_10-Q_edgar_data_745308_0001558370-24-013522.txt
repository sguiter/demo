Business Overview St. Joe is a real estate development, asset management and operating company with all of its real estate assets and operations in Northwest Florida. We intend to use existing assets for residential, hospitality and commercial ventures. We have significant residential and commercial land-use entitlements. We actively seek higher and better uses for our real estate assets through a range of development activities. As part of our core business strategy, we have created a meaningful portion of our business through JVs and limited partnerships over the past several years. We enter into these arrangements for the purposes of developing real estate and other business activities, which we believe allows us to complement our growth strategy, leverage industry expertise and diversify our business. We may also partner with or explore the sale of discrete assets when we and/or others can better deploy resources. We seek to enhance the value of our owned real estate assets by developing residential, commercial and hospitality projects to meet market demand. Approximately 87 of our real estate is located in Florida s Bay, Gulf, and Walton counties. Approximately 90 of our real estate land holdings are located within fifteen miles of the Gulf of Mexico. We believe our present capital structure, liquidity and land provide us with years of opportunities to increase recurring revenue and long-term value for our shareholders. We intend to focus on our core business activity of real estate development, asset management and operations. We continue to develop a broad range of asset types that we believe will provide acceptable rates of return, grow recurring revenues and support future business. Capital commitments will be funded with cash proceeds from completed projects, existing cash, owned-land, partner capital and financing arrangements. We do not anticipate immediate benefits from investments. Timing of projects may be subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control. We may also choose to operate rather than lease assets, lease rather than sell assets, or sell improved rather than unimproved land that may delay revenue and profits. Our real estate investment strategy focuses on projects that meet long-term risk-adjusted return criteria. Our practice is to only incur such expenditures when our analysis indicates that a project will generate a return equal to or greater than the threshold return over its life. Highlights for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 include: Hospitality revenue increased by 16.9 for the third quarter of 2024 to 55.4 million from 47.4 million and increased 34.2 for the first nine months of 2024 to 157.0 million from 117.0 million.

 Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 2.4 to 99.0 million from 101.4 million. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 4.4 to 21.2 million from 20.3 million. Net income attributable to the Company decreased by 13.4 to 16.8 million from 19.4 million during the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to timing of homesite closings and product mix of sales in different residential communities and a reduction in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by growth in hospitality and leasing revenue. Over 22,000 homesites are in various stages of planning or development. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,381 residential homesites under contract, which are expected to result in revenue of approximately 122.3 million. 
 Market Conditions Throughout the first nine months of 2024, we continued to generate positive financial results. While macroeconomic factors such as inflation, elevated interest rates, higher insurance costs, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, financial institution disruptions and geopolitical conflicts, among other things, continued to produce economic headwinds and impacted buyer sentiment, demand across our segments remains strong. We believe this is primarily due to the continued growth of Northwest Florida as a result of increased migration, which we attribute to the region s high quality of life, natural beauty and outstanding amenities. Despite the strong demand across our segments, we also continue to feel the impact from the aforementioned macroeconomic factors. In addition, inflation, higher insurance costs and elevated interest rates, have increased operating costs and loan rates, as compared to recent years. While elevated interest rates have negatively impacted buyers ability to obtain financing and the housing market generally, the impact has been offset by the net migration into our markets, limited housing supply relative to demand and the number of cash buyers. Market conditions have also not caused an increase in cancellation rates as homebuilders have continued to perform on their contractual obligations with us. Given our diverse portfolio of residential holdings, the mix of sales and pricing from different communities may impact revenue and margins period over period, as discussed in more detail below. Reportable Segments We conduct primarily all of our business in the following three reportable segments: (1) residential, (2) hospitality and (3) commercial. The following table sets forth the relative contribution of these reportable segments to our consolidated operating revenue: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Segment Operating Revenue Residential 19.2 35.0 27.3 42.0 Hospitality 57.0 47.3 53.5 39.2 Commercial 22.7 16.2 18.1 17.7 Other 1.1 1.5 1.1 1.1 Consolidated operating revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 For more information regarding our reportable segments see Note 17. Segment Information . Residential Segment Our residential segment typically plans and develops residential communities of various sizes across a wide range of price points and sells homesites to homebuilders or retail consumers. Our residential segment also evaluates opportunities to enter into JV agreements for specific communities such as Latitude Margaritaville Watersound.

Table of Contents 
 The residential segment generates revenue from sales of homesites, homes and other residential land and certain homesite residuals from homebuilder sales that provide us a percentage of the sale price of the completed home if the home price exceeds a negotiated threshold. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when a sale is closed and title and control have been transferred to the buyer. The residential segment also generates revenue from the sale of tap and impact fee credits, marketing fees and other fees on certain transactions. Certain homesite residuals and other revenue related to homebuilder homesite sales are recognized in revenue at the point in time of the closing of the sale. The residential segment incurs costs from direct costs (e.g., development and construction costs), selling costs and other indirect costs. Our residential segment includes the Watersound Origins, Watersound Origins West, Watersound Camp Creek, Breakfast Point East, Titus Park, Bayside at Ward Creek, Breakwater at Ward Creek, Salt Grass at Ward Creek, College Station, Park Place, Salt Creek at Mexico Beach, and WindMark Beach communities, which are large scale, multi-phase communities with current development activity, sales activity or future phases. Homesites in these communities are developed based on market demand and sold primarily to homebuilders and on a limited basis to retail customers. The East Lake Creek, East Lake Powell, Lake Powell, Teachee, West Bay Creek and West Laird communities have phases of homesites in preliminary planning or permitting. Homesites in these communities will be developed based on market demand and sold primarily to homebuilders and on a limited basis to retail customers. The SummerCamp Beach community has homesites available for sale and along with the RiverCamps and SouthWood communities, have additional lands for future development. The Latitude Margaritaville Watersound community is a planned 55+ active adult residential community in Bay County, Florida. The community is located near the Intracoastal Waterway with convenient access to the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport. The community is being developed through our unconsolidated Latitude Margaritaville Watersound JV with our partner Minto Communities USA, a homebuilder and community developer, and is estimated to include approximately 3,500 residential homes, which are being developed in smaller increments of discrete neighborhoods. As of September 30, 2024, the unconsolidated Latitude Margaritaville Watersound JV had 426 homes under contract, which are expected to result in a sales value to the JV of approximately 254.4 million at closing of the homes. See Note 4. Joint Ventures for additional information.

(g) Ward Creek is being developed as three separate distinct communities. 
 In addition to the communities listed above, we have a number of other residential project concepts in various stages of planning and evaluation. As of September 30, 2024, we had nineteen different homebuilders within our residential communities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,381 residential homesites under contract, which are expected to result in revenue of approximately 122.3 million, plus residuals, at closing of the homesites over the next several years. By comparison, as of September 30, 2023, we had 1,575 residential homesites under contract, with an expected revenue of approximately 135.5 million, plus residuals. The change in homesites under contract is due to homesite transactions since the end of the prior period and the amount of remaining homesites in current phases of the residential communities. The number of homesites under contract is subject to change based on homesite closings and new sales activity. Homesite prices vary significantly by community and often sell in concentrated transactions that may impact quarterly results. As of September 30, 2024, in addition to the 1,381 homesites under contract in other residential communities, our unconsolidated Latitude Margaritaville Watersound JV had 426 homes under contract, which together with the 1,381 homesites are expected to result in a sales value of approximately 376.7 million at closing of the homesites and homes.

 Total square feet are based on current estimates and are subject to change . Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience, available current market information and on various other assumptions that management believes are 

 53 

Table of Contents 
 reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on-going basis. Management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and our accounting estimates are subject to change. Critical accounting policies that we believe reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements are set forth in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in these policies during the first nine months of 2024, however we cannot assure you that these policies will not change in the future. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for recently issued or adopted accounting standards, including the date of adoption and effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Seasonality and Market Variability Our operations may be affected by seasonal fluctuations. The revenues and earnings from our business segments may vary significantly from period to period. Homebuilders tend to buy multiple homesites in sporadic transactions. In addition, homesite prices vary significantly by community, which further impacts period over period results. Therefore, there may be reporting periods in which we have no, or significantly less, revenue from residential or commercial real estate sales. We may also choose to operate rather than lease assets, lease rather than sell assets, or sell improved rather than unimproved land that may delay revenue and profits. Hospitality revenues are typically higher in the second and third quarters, and vary depending on the timing of holidays and school breaks. Commercial real estate sales tend to be non-recurring. Projects depend on uncertain demand. Extraordinary events such as hurricanes or public health emergencies may dramatically change demand and pricing for products and services.

 Residential Real Estate Revenue and Gross Profit . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, residential real estate revenue decreased 16.5 million, or 46.5 , to 19.0 million, as compared to 35.5 million during the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, residential real estate gross profit decreased 8.9 million to 7.5 million (or gross margin of 39.5 ), as compared to 16.4 million (or gross margin of 46.2 during the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 179 homesites, compared to 254 homesites during the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average base revenue, excluding homesite residuals, per homesite sold was approximately 86,000 and 103,000, respectively, due to the mix of sales from different communities. The revenue, gross profit and margin for each period was impacted by the difference in pricing among the communities, the difference in the cost of the homesite development and the volume of sales within each of the communities. The number of homesites sold varied each period due to the timing of homebuilder contractual closing obligations in our residential communities.

 Total leasing revenue increased 2.2 million, or 17.9 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to new multi-family and commercial property leases, as well as other new leases. Total leasing gross margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 54.5 , as compared to 52.0 during the same period in 2023. The increase in leasing gross margin was primarily due to new leases, as well as new assets being operational throughout the current period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had three commercial and forestry real estate sales of approximately 25 acres for 7.3 million resulting in a gross profit margin of approximately 56.2 .

Timber revenue decreased 0.3 million, or 30.0 , to 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.0 million during the same period in 2023.

Timber gross margin was 71.4 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 80.0 during the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to less tons of wood products sold and lower prices in the current period. Other operating expenses include salaries and benefits, property taxes, CDD assessments, professional fees, marketing, project administration and other administrative expenses. The increase of 0.8 million in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to new properties placed in service.

We believe the diversity of our commercial segment complements the growth of our residential and hospitality segments. Commercial and forestry real estate revenue can vary depending on the proximity to developed areas and the mix and characteristics of commercial and forestry real estate sold in each period, with varying compositions of retail, office, industrial, timber and other commercial uses.

Timber revenue decreased 1.1 million, or 27.5 , to 2.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.0 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in tons of wood products sold and prices in the current period. There were 186,000 tons of wood products sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 216,000 tons of wood products sold during the same period in 2023. The average price of wood products sold decreased to 14.21 per ton during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 16.62 per ton during the same period in 2023. Timber gross margin was 79.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 85.0 during the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to less tons of wood products sold and lower prices in the current period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 82.7 million, compared to 86.1 million as of December 31, 2023.

CDD bonds financed the construction of infrastructure improvements in some of our communities. The principal and interest payments on the bonds are paid by assessments on the properties benefited by the improvements financed by the bonds. We have recorded a liability for CDD debt that is associated with platted property, which is the point at which it becomes fixed and determinable. Additionally, we have recorded a liability for the balance of the CDD debt that is associated with unplatted property if it is probable and reasonably estimable that we will ultimately be responsible for repayment. We have recorded CDD related debt of 2.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Total outstanding CDD debt related to our land holdings was 10.1 million as of September 30, 2024, which was comprised of 8.3 million at the SouthWood community, 1.7 million at the existing Pier Park retail center and less than 0.1 million at the Wild Heron community.

Table of Contents 
 other financial guarantees of 46.7 million and 40.0 million, respectively, as well as standby letters of credit in the amount of 0.7 million and 0.2 million, respectively, which may potentially result in a liability to us if certain obligations are not met. In conducting our operations, we routinely hold customers assets in escrow pending completion of real estate transactions, and are responsible for the proper disposition of these balances for our customers. These amounts are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, consistent with GAAP and industry practice. The cash deposit accounts and offsetting liability balances for escrow deposits in connection with our title insurance agencies for real estate transactions were 9.2 million and 10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These escrow funds are not available for regular operations. Summary of Cash Flows A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 In millions Net cash provided by operating activities 78.2 92.3 Net cash used in investing activities (42.4) (81.5) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (34.4) 46.9 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 1.4 57.7 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of the period 90.8 45.3 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of the period 92.2 103.0 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows provided by operating activities include net income, adjustments for non-cash items, changes in operating assets and liabilities and expenditures related to assets ultimately planned to be sold, including developed and undeveloped land. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily include depreciation, depletion and amortization, equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures, net of distributions, deferred income tax and cost of real estate sold. Net cash provided by operations was 78.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 92.3 million during the same period in 2023. Net income was 54.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 62.0 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the changes in net income, cost of real estate sold, deferred revenue and accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by the changes in depreciation, depletion and amortization, equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures, net of distributions, deferred income tax, expenditures for and acquisition of real estate to be sold and other assets during the period. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities primarily include capital expenditures for operating property and property and equipment used in our operations, purchases of investments and capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by proceeds from insurance claims, maturities of investments, capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures and maturities of assets held by SPEs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 42.4 million, which included capital expenditures for operating property and equipment and capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of 1.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of assets of 0.1 million, proceeds from insurance claims of 0.2 million, capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of 0.2 million and maturities of assets held by SPEs of 0.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 81.5 million, which included capital expenditures for operating property and equipment, purchases of investments of U.S. Treasury Bills of 37.4 million and capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of 2.3 million, partially offset by maturities of investments of 

 75

 69.0 million, capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of 0.2 million and maturities of assets held by SPEs of 0.8 million. Capital expenditures for operating property and property and equipment were 41.9 million and 111.8 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were primarily for our commercial and hospitality segments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 34.4 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 46.9 million during the same period in 2023.

Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included capital contributions from non-controlling interest of 0.7 million and borrowings on debt of 118.3 million, partially offset by capital distributions to non-controlling interest of 2.2 million, dividends paid of 18.7 million, principal payments for debt of 50.1 million, principal payments for finance leases of 0.1 million and debt issuance costs of 1.0 million. Contractual Obligations There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business in our contractual obligations during the third quarter of 2024. Forward-Looking Statements This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These statements include, among other things, information about possible or assumed future results of the business and our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans, strategies, prospects and objectives. Such forward-looking statements can generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, believe, continue or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. We caution you that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and while we believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated as a result of various important factors, including: our ability to successfully implement our strategic objectives; new or increased competition across our business units; any decline in general economic conditions, particularly in our primary markets; interest rate fluctuations; inflation; financial institution disruptions; supply chain disruptions; geopolitical conflicts (such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Gaza Strip and the general unrest in the Middle East) and political uncertainty and the corresponding impact on the global economy; our ability to successfully execute or integrate new business endeavors and acquisitions; our ability to yield anticipated returns from our developments and projects; our ability to effectively manage our real estate assets, as well as the ability for us or our JV partners to effectively manage the day-to-day activities of our JV projects; our ability to complete construction and development projects within expected timeframes; the interest of prospective guests in our hotels, including the new hotels we have opened since the beginning of 2023; reductions in travel and other risks inherent to the hospitality industry; the illiquidity of all real estate assets; financial risks, including risks relating to currency fluctuations, credit risks, and fluctuations in the market value of our investment portfolio; any potential negative impact of our longer-term property development strategy, including losses and negative cash flows for an extended period of time if we continue with the self-development of granted entitlements; our dependence on homebuilders; mix of sales from different communities and the corresponding impact on sales period over period; the financial condition of our commercial tenants; regulatory and insurance risks associated with our senior living facilities; public health emergencies; any reduction in the supply of mortgage loans or tightening of credit markets; our dependence on strong migration and

Table of Contents 
 population expansion in our regions of development, particularly Northwest Florida; our ability to fully recover from natural disasters and severe weather conditions; the actual or perceived threat of climate change; the seasonality of our business; our ability to obtain adequate insurance for our properties or rising insurance costs; our dependence on certain third party providers; the inability of minority shareholders to influence corporate matters, due to concentrated ownership of largest shareholder; the impact of unfavorable legal proceedings or government investigations; the impact of complex and changing laws and regulations in the areas we operate; changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities, including with respect to Qualified Opportunity Zone program; new litigation; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly in our hospitality business; our ability to protect our information technology infrastructure and defend against cyber-attacks; increased media, political, and regulatory scrutiny negatively impacting our reputation; our ability to maintain adequate internal controls; risks associated with our financing arrangements, including our compliance with certain restrictions and limitations; our ability to pay our quarterly dividend; the potential volatility of our common stock; and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in Risk Factors beginning on page 7 of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and from time to time in our subsequent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to revise or publicly released any revision to any forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q unless required by law. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risks primarily from interest rate risk fluctuations. We have investments in short-term U.S. Treasury Bills that have fixed interest rates for which changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the investment, but not the earnings or cash flows. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of less than 0.1 million in the market value of these investments as of September 30, 2024. Any realized gain or loss resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity or if a decline in their value is determined to be related to credit loss. We have historically been exposed, and in the future may again be exposed, to credit risk associated with investments classified as available-for-sale securities Securities and these instruments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market s assessment of issuer credit quality, increases in delinquency and default rates, changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors. A downgrade of the U.S. government s credit rating may also decrease the value of Securities. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market instruments. Changes in interest rates related to these investments would not significantly impact our results of operations. We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable-rate debt and utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on certain loans. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate risk associated with some of our variable rate debt, with changes in the fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2024, we had variable-rate debt outstanding totaling 189.2 million, of which 40.9 million was swapped to a fixed interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate loans, excluding the swapped portion, based on SOFR was 7.1 . Based on the outstanding balance of these loans as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the applicable rate would result in an increase to our annual interest expense of 1.5 million. See Note 6. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements and Note 9. Debt, Net for additional information. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

In addition, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which include obligations to remove or limit the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain wastes or substances at various sites, including sites which have been previously sold.
