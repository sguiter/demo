In certain cases, the Company may or may not designate certain derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. The Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. Market Risks Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company has manufacturing locations primarily in Mexico and Poland, and sells its products globally. As a result, the Company s financial results could be significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rates. To help mitigate gross margin and cash flow fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain subsidiaries in Mexico and Poland, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar or the Euro, hedge a portion of their forecasted foreign currency costs denominated in the Mexican Peso and Polish Zloty. The Company may hedge portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure up to months. Interest Rate Risk The Company has borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facilities that are at variable rates of interest and expose it to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps exchanging floating for fixed-rate interest payments in order to reduce its interest rate volatility. Commodity Price Risk The principal raw material used in manufacturing aluminum wheels is aluminum alloys. While wheel prices under OEM customer contracts are adjusted for fluctuations in the cost of this material, the prices of its aftermarket wheels are generally fixed months in advance of the spring and winter sales seasons. Accordingly, the Company hedges a portion of its aftermarket aluminum purchases to offset the effect of fluctuating aluminum cost on its margins. In addition, the manufacture of aluminum wheels is energy-intensive, so the Company fixes a portion of its natural gas and electricity purchases with derivatives or contractual arrangements with energy suppliers. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company has derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. These derivatives are accounted for as either assets or liabilities and adjusted to fair value each period with the resulting gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income or loss OCI or OCL until the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Once the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings for foreign exchange and commodity derivatives, the gain or loss initially recorded in accumulated OCI or OCL is recognized in cost of sales, while gains or losses on interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense, net. Derivatives that have not been designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value each period and any gain or loss is recognized in other income (expense), net. The Company has also recorded a derivative liability related to an embedded feature within the redeemable preferred stock (refer to Note 10 Redeemable Shares and the term loan facility (refer to Note 8 Debt ).

Derivative Financial Instruments The Company has over-the-counter customized derivative instruments and are not exchange-traded. The fair value of these instruments is estimated using the income valuation approach, which projects future cash flows and discounts the future amounts to a present value using market-based expectations for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments. The discount rate used is the relevant benchmark rate (e.g., the secured overnight financing rate, SOFR plus an adjustment for counterparty risk. The fair value measurements of certain derivative liabilities rely primarily on Company-specific inputs, as observable inputs are not available.

Simultaneously with the execution of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to the First Amendment to Credit Agreement to, among other things (i) amend the financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement, (ii) amend the maturity date applicable to the revolving commitments to remove the springing maturity applicable, thereto and (iii) require that the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement be repaid in the event the Company holds cash in excess of a certain threshold. The revolving commitments will mature on . Prepayments Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid subject to a prepayment premium of of the loan principal plus the net present value of any lost interest in the first year, and and of the loan principal during second and third years.

 (iii) Liquidity of at least million (subject to adjustments up to million following any increase in the commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility) but only so long as loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility are outstanding. 

 Additionally, if the Company pays the preferred stock dividends in cash to the preferred shareholders, the Credit Agreements require it to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreements) to be less than : at the end of the period such payment is made. The Credit Agreements contain customary default provisions that include among other things: non-payment of principal or interest when due, failure to comply with obligations, covenants or other provisions in the Credit Agreements, any failure of representations and warranties, cross-default under other debt agreements for obligations in excess of million, insolvency, failure to pay judgments in excess of million within 60 days of the judicial award, failure to pay any material plan withdrawal obligations under ERISA, invalidity of the loan agreement, invalidity of any security interest in the loan collateral, change of control and failure to maintain the financial covenants. In the event a default occurs, all commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be terminated and the lenders would be entitled to declare the principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all borrowings outstanding to be due and payable. In addition, the Credit Agreements contain customary representations and warranties and other covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreements. Available Unused Commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and unused commitments of million, which has been reduced for outstanding letters of credit of million.

As of the Redemption Date, the Notes were no longer deemed outstanding and interest on the Notes ceased to accrue. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the redemption of the Notes. European Debt In connection with the acquisition of UNIWHEELS AG in 2017, the Company assumed million of outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2023, million of the assumed debt remained outstanding.

The redeemable preferred stock may be redeemed at the holder s election on or after or upon the occurrence of a redemption event, provided the Company has cash legally available to pay such redemption. If the Company is unable to redeem the shares of preferred stock in full, any shares of preferred stock not redeemed would continue to receive an annual dividend of on the stated value which would be payable quarterly. The Board of Directors would have to evaluate periodically the ability of the Company to make any redemption payments until the full redemption amount has been paid.

 thousand shares) are participating securities and have not been included in the diluted earnings per share because they would be anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In calculating basic and diluted earnings per share, a company with participating securities must allocate earnings to the participating securities with a corresponding reduction in the earnings attributable to common shares under the two-class method. Losses are only allocated to participating securities when the security holders have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company with common stockholders. Because the redeemable preferred shareholders do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company s losses with common stockholders, the full amount of the Company s losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were attributed to the common shares.

 Executive Overview 
 Overview of Superior 
 The principal business of Superior Industries International, Inc. (referred herein as the Company, Superior, or we , us , and our is the design and manufacture of aluminum wheels for sale to original equipment manufacturers OEMs in North America and Europe, and to the aftermarket in Europe. Our aluminum wheels are primarily sold to OEMs for factory installation on new light vehicles. We also sell aluminum wheels to the European aftermarket under the brands ATS, RIAL, ALUTEC and ANZIO. North America and Europe represent the primary markets for our products, but we have a diversified global customer base consisting of North American, European, and Asian OEMs. 
 Demand for our products is mainly driven by light vehicle production levels in North America and Europe and customer take rates on specific vehicle platforms that we serve and wheel SKUs that we produce. The majority of our customers wheel programs are awarded two to four years before actual production is expected to begin. Our purchase orders with OEMs are typically specific to a particular vehicle model. 
 On August 31, 2023, our then-owned subsidiary Superior Industries Production Germany GmbH SPG filed voluntary petitions for preliminary insolvency proceedings (i.e., equivalent to Chapter 11 under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). Effective August 31, 2023, we no longer control SPG and deconsolidated the subsidiary, therefore, it is no longer included in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 22 Loss on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. With the deconsolidation of SPG, we relocated our wheel production from Germany to Poland (the European Transformation ).

Industry Overview, Supply Chain Disruption, and the Ukraine Conflict 
 
 There is a broad range of factors which affect automotive industry sales and production volumes, including consumer demand and preferences, dealer inventory levels, labor relations issues, trade agreements, cost and availability of raw materials and components, energy prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, availability and cost of credit, changing consumer attitudes toward vehicle ownership, and other factors. Our sales are driven generally by overall automotive industry production volumes and, more specifically, by the volumes of the vehicles for which we supply wheels. In addition, larger diameter wheels and premium finishes command higher unit prices. Larger cars and light trucks, as well as premium vehicle platforms, such as luxury, sport utility and crossover vehicles, typically employ larger diameter wheels and premium finishes. 
 
 The automotive industry was affected by supply chain disruptions and cost inflation that emerged following the COVID-19 global pandemic, which led to operating challenges for the automotive supplier base. The supply chain disruptions included shortages of semiconductors. Cost inflation has moderated somewhat but remains higher than pre-pandemic levels and has resulted in an increase in the cost of raw materials, labor, and energy. In addition, higher interest rates have adversely affected, and will likely continue to affect, our earnings and cash flow from operations. 
 
 In early 2022, the Ukraine Conflict contributed to order volatility and intensified inflationary cost pressures, specifically the cost of energy. While the cost of energy moderated in 2023, it remains higher in Europe than prices prevailing prior to the pandemic and the Ukraine Conflict. 
 
 The prices under our OEM contracts are adjusted for changes in the cost of aluminum and certain other costs; however, our aftermarket contracts do not provide such pass through of aluminum or other costs. Future increases in raw material costs and OEM production volatility may cause our inventory levels to increase, negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flow from operations. 
 Automotive industry production volumes in the North American and Western and Central European regions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (as published in October 2024 by IHS for Light Vehicles, an automotive industry analyst), as compared to the corresponding period of 2023, are shown below:

 The IHS October 2024 forecast projects that production volumes in our primary markets are expected to decline 4.0 in 2024 (a decline of 6.6 in Western and Central Europe and a decline of 1.4 in North America) and are expected to be 12.7 below pre-pandemic levels. IHS forecasts production volumes of our key customers to decrease 0.9 (a decline of 6.0 in Western and Central Europe, partially offset by an increase of 1.9 in North America). 
 Sustainability 
 We published our 2023 Sustainability Report in December 2023. That report reflected the results of the materiality assessment we conducted in 2021 to identify the sustainability interests of our stakeholders and develop our sustainability strategy. Based on that input, we remain committed to reducing natural gas, electricity and water consumption and solid waste and air emissions at our facilities. All Superior manufacturing facilities have implemented Environmental Management Systems that are ISO14001 certified and are subject to annual audits by an independent third party. 
 We continue to explore opportunities to: 
 reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and 

offer low or zero carbon wheels to our customers. 

Furthermore, our research and development team continues to develop light weighting solutions, such as our patented Alulite technology, and aerodynamic solutions that will assist in reducing our customers carbon footprint. We also collaborate with our customers and suppliers regarding sustainability practices throughout their supply chains.

Net Sales 
 Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 321.8 million, compared to net sales of 323.1 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 0.4 . The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volumes of 3.6 million and a lower pricing and product mix of 1.9 million, which was partially offset by higher aluminum pass throughs to our OEM customers of 3.6 million. The volume decline is primarily attributable to the decline in the Western and Central Europe markets and to a lesser extent the deconsolidation of the financial results of the manufacturing facility in Germany, which was partially offset by an increase in North America volumes despite a decrease in industry production volumes. 
 Value Added Sales Adjusted for Foreign Exchange 
 Value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange was 170.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to value added sales of 176.0 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 3.4 . 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales was 293.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to cost of sales of 297.8 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1.6 . The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to lower conversion costs of 5.6 million and lower volumes of 1.8 million, which was partially offset by a higher product mix of 2.7 million. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses of 23.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased 7.0 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the debt refinancing, and restructuring and restructuring-related costs associated with the European Transformation. 
 Loss on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary 
 On August 31, 2023 (the Filing Date ), our then-owned subsidiary Superior Industries Production Germany GmbH SPG filed voluntary petitions for preliminary insolvency proceedings, seeking relief under the German Insolvency Code. Effective as of the 
 24 

Filing Date, we deconsolidated SPG from our condensed consolidated financial statements, recognizing a charge to operations of 79.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Net interest expense was 17.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net interest expense of 15.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 13.9 . The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to the upsizing of the borrowings under the amended and restated term loan and an increase in interest expense on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest related to the senior notes, which were redeemed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt for the third quarter of 2024 was 13.1 million related to the prepayment of our term loan facility in connection with the debt refinancing and redemption of the senior notes; refer to Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources within this Management s Discussion and Analysis for additional information. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income was 2.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to other income of 0.2 million for the same period in 2023. This was primarily due to foreign exchange gains of 3.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to foreign exchange gains of 0.6 million, which was partially offset by an increase in factoring fees of 1.1 million. 
 Income Tax (Provision) Benefit 
 The income tax provision for the third quarter of 2024 was 0.9 million on a pre-tax loss of 23.9 million, representing an effective income tax rate of (3.7 ). This differs from the statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances and the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. The income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2023 was 0.4 million on pre-tax loss of 86.7 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 0.4 . This differs from the statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances and the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was 24.8 million, or a 1.24 loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss of 86.3 million, or a 3.42 loss per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in the net loss is attributable to the aforementioned items.

North America 
 Net sales for our North America segment for the third quarter of 2024 increased 5.8 compared to the same period in 2023. The 11.4 million increase in net sales was primarily due to higher aluminum cost pass throughs to our OEM customers of 6.8 million, higher volumes of 2.8 million, and a higher pricing and product mix of 2.0 million. 
 North America segment income from operations for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 0.4 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher SG A expenses of 3.9 million primarily related to the debt refinancing, which was partially offset by lower conversion costs of 2.1 million, higher volumes of 0.8 million, and a higher pricing and product mix of 0.6 million. 
 25 

Europe 
 Net sales for our European segment for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 9.9 compared to the same period in 2023. The 12.7 million decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volumes of 6.4 million, a lower pricing and product mix of 3.9 million, and lower aluminum cost pass throughs to our OEM customers of 3.2 million. The decrease in volume was primarily attributable to the decline in the Western and Central European market and to a lesser extent the deconsolidation of the financial results of the manufacturing facility in Germany. 
 The European segment loss from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was 9.2 million as compared to the loss from operations of 85.5 million in the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the 79.6 million loss on deconsolidation of SPG, lower conversion costs of 7.7 million, which was partially offset by a lower pricing and product mix of 5.3 million, higher SG A expenses of 3.2 million related to the European Transformation, and lower volumes of 2.5 million.

Net Sales 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 were 957.0 million, compared to net sales of 1,076.6 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 11.1 . The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower aluminum pass throughs to our OEM customers of 64.3 million, lower volumes of 39.3 million, and a lower pricing and product mix of 16.8 million. The volume decline is primarily attributable to the deconsolidation of the financial results of the manufacturing facility in Germany, the decline in our primary markets, and the exit from an unprofitable contract with one of our customers during 2023. 
 Value Added Sales Adjusted for Foreign Exchange 
 Value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange was 522.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange of 578.9 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 9.7 . 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales was 875.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to cost of sales of 975.7 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 10.3 . The decrease in cost of sales was due to lower conversion costs of 81.1 million and lower volumes of 23.2 million, which was partially offset by a higher product mix of 4.2 million. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were 66.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 53.3 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 12.8 million. This increase was primarily due to restructuring and restructuring-related costs associated with the European Transformation and the debt refinancing. 
 27 

Loss on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary 
 On August 31, 2023 (the Filing Date ), our then-owned subsidiary Superior Industries Production Germany GmbH SPG filed voluntary petitions for preliminary insolvency proceedings, seeking relief under the German Insolvency Code. Effective as of the Filing Date, we deconsolidated SPG from our condensed consolidated financial statements, recognizing a charge to operations of 79.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Net interest expense was 49.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net interest expense of 47.1 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 5.3 . The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to the upsizing of the borrowings under the amended and restated term loan and an increase in interest expense on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest related to the senior notes, which were redeemed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt for the first nine months of 2024 was 13.1 million related to the prepayment of our term loan facility in connection with the debt refinancing and redemption of the senior notes; refer to Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources within this Management s Discussion and Analysis for additional information. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income was 2.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to other expense of 2.6 million for the same period in 2023. This was primarily due to higher foreign exchange gains of 4.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 and an unfavorable adjustment to a casualty loss recovery of 1.4 million in the same period in 2023. 
 Income Tax (Provision) Benefit 
 The income tax provision for the first nine months of 2024 was 23.9 million on a pre-tax loss of 44.7 million, representing an effective income tax rate of (53.6 ). The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances, the reversal of an uncertain tax position, the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, and a tax charge affecting deferred tax assets related to tax restructuring of 17.8 million. The income tax provision for the first nine months of 2023 was 8.7 million on a pre-tax loss of 81.7 million, representing an effective income tax rate of (10.7 ). This differs from the statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances, the reversal of an uncertain tax position, and the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Net loss for the first nine months of 2024 was 68.6 million, or a 3.50 loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss of 90.4 million, or 4.29 loss per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net loss was attributable to the aforementioned items.

North America 
 Net sales for our North American segment for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 1.9 compared to the same period in 2023. The 11.8 million decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower aluminum cost pass throughs to our OEM customers of 14.9 million and a lower pricing and product mix of 6.2 million, which was partially offset by higher volumes of 9.0 million. 
 North American segment income from operations for the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 22.3 million, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a lower pricing and product mix of 11.4 million, higher conversion costs of 7.6 million,

higher SG A expenses of 6.6 million primarily due to the debt refinancing, which was partially offset by higher volumes of 3.3 million. 
 Europe 
 Net sales for our European segment for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 23.4 compared to the same period in 2023. The 107.9 million decrease in net sales was due to lower aluminum cost pass throughs to our OEM customers of 49.4 million, lower volumes of 48.3 million, and a lower pricing and product mix of 10.6 million. The decline in volume was primarily attributable to the deconsolidation of the financial results of the manufacturing facility in Germany, the decline in the Western and Central European market, and the exit from an unprofitable contract with one of our customers during 2023. 
 The European segment loss from operations for the first nine months of 2024 was 69.7 million lower than the same period in 2023. The decrease in the loss from operations was primarily due to the 79.6 million loss on deconsolidation of SPG, lower conversion costs of 25.0 million, which was partially offset by lower volumes of 19.3 million, a lower pricing and product mix of 9.5 million, and higher SG A expenses of 6.2 million related to the European Transformation. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our working capital requirements, investing activities and preferred stock cash dividend payments have historically been funded by cash flow from operations. 
 
 Capital expenditures relate to improving production quality and efficiency and extending the useful lives of our existing equipment, and expenditures for new product offerings, as well as expanded capacity for existing products. During 2024, we expect that capital expenditures will be approximately between 30.0 million and 40.0 million.

488,061 

On December 15, 2022, we entered into a 400.0 million term loan facility (the 2022 Term Loan Facility pursuant to a credit agreement (the 2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement with Oaktree Fund Administration L.L.C., in its capacity as the administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as collateral agent, and other lenders party thereto. Concurrent with the execution of the 2022 Term Loan Facility, we entered into a 60.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as administrative agent, collateral agent and issuing bank, and other lenders and issuing banks thereunder. 
 
 On August 14, 2024, we amended and restated the 2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement in the form of an amended and restated credit agreement, by and among Oaktree Fund Administration L.L.C., in its capacity as the administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as a collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto (the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement and, together with the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreements ), pursuant to which we incurred a new 520.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or SSCF ). The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used to (i) refinance the 2022 Term Loan Facility, (ii) discharge our 6.000 Senior Notes due 2025, (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility matures on December 15, 2028 (with no springing maturity). 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 12.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the prepayment of the 2022 Term Loan Credit Agreement in connection with the debt refinancing. 
 
 29 

Simultaneously with the execution of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to the First Amendment to Credit Agreement to, among other things (i) amend the financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement, (ii) amend the maturity date applicable to the revolving commitments to remove the springing maturity applicable, thereto and (iii) require that the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement be repaid in the event we hold cash in excess of a certain threshold. The revolving commitments will mature on December 15, 2027. 
 
 Prepayments 
 Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid subject to a prepayment premium of 2.00 of the loan principal plus the net present value of any lost interest in the first year, and 2.00 and 1.00 of the loan principal during second and third years. After the third anniversary of the date of the amendment and restatement date, there is no prepayment premium. 
 
 The Credit Agreements include certain mandatory prepayment provisions, including, among others, a requirement (i) to prepay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, with any cash on hand in excess of 50 million at the end of each calendar month, (ii) to prepay amounts under the Term Loan Facility with any amount of Liquidity (defined as the sum of unrestricted cash and cash equivalent balances and amounts available to be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility), after giving effect to any prepayment required under clause (i) above, in excess of 80 million at the end of each calendar month, and (iii) to prepay the Term Loan Facility with 75 of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement) generated by us, subject to customary deductions. 
 
 The Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement contains a mandatory prepayment provision upon the event of default, which we have accounted for separately as a derivative liability. As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a derivative liability of 2.1 million in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Interest Rates 
 Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), with a floor of 2.50 per annum, or (ii) a base rate Term Base Rate ), with a floor of 2.50 per annum, equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest in effect as publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate, (2) the New York Federal Reserve Bank (the NYFRB rate plus 0.50 , and (3) SOFR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 , in each case, plus the applicable rate of 7.50 per annum for SOFR loans and 6.50 per annum for Term Base Rate loans. In the event of a payment default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, past due amounts shall be subject to an additional default interest rate of 2.00 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate in effect on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Facility was 12.6 . 
 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) SOFR plus 0.10 (or, with respect to any borrowings denominated in euros, the adjusted Euro Interbank Offered Rate, EURIBOR ), with a floor of 0.00 per annum or (ii) a base rate Revolving Loan Base Rate ), with a floor of 1.00 per annum, equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest in effect as publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate, (2) the NYFRB rate plus 0.50 and (3) SOFR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 , in each case, plus the applicable rate. The applicable rate is determined by reference to our Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) and ranges between 3.50 and 4.50 per annum for SOFR (4.5 per annum for the current fiscal quarter) and EURIBOR loans, and between 2.50 and 3.50 per annum for Revolving Base Rate loans (3.5 per annum for the current fiscal quarter). The commitment fee for the unused commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility varies between 0.50 and 0.625 per annum depending on our Secured Net Leverage Ratio (0.625 per annum for the current fiscal quarter). Commitment fees are included in interest expense. In the event of a payment default under the Revolving Credit Agreement, past due amounts shall be subject to an additional default interest rate of 2.00 . 
 
 Guarantees and Collateral Security 
 Our obligations under the Credit Agreements are unconditionally guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries (collectively, the SSCF Subsidiary Guarantors ), with customary exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in adverse tax consequences. The guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and the SSCF Subsidiary Guarantors assets, including but not limited to: (i) a perfected pledge of all of the capital stock issued by each of the SSCF Subsidiary Guarantors (subject to certain exceptions) and (ii) perfected security interests in and mortgages on substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material fee-owned real property of ours and the SSCF Subsidiary Guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and exclusions).

(iii) Liquidity of at least 37.5 million (subject to adjustments up to 50.0 million following any increase in the commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility) but only so long as loans under the Amended and Restated Term Loan Facility are outstanding. 

Additionally, if we pay the preferred stock dividends in cash to the preferred shareholders, the Credit Agreements require us to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreements) to be less than 1.10:1.00 at the end of the period such payment is made. 
 
 The Credit Agreements contain customary default provisions that include among other things: non-payment of principal or interest when due, failure to comply with obligations, covenants or other provisions in the Credit Agreements, any failure of representations and warranties, cross-default under other debt agreements for obligations in excess of 20.0 million, insolvency, failure to pay judgments in excess of 20.0 million within 60 days of the judicial award, failure to pay any material plan withdrawal obligations under ERISA, invalidity of the loan agreement, invalidity of any security interest in the loan collateral, change of control and failure to maintain the financial covenants. In the event a default occurs, all commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be terminated and the lenders would be entitled to declare the principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all borrowings outstanding to be due and payable. 
 
 In addition, the Credit Agreements contain customary representations and warranties and other covenants. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreements. 
 
 Available Unused Commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and unused commitments of 52.5 million, which have been reduced for outstanding letters of credit of 7.5 million. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 On June 15, 2017, we issued 250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.000 Senior Notes due June 15, 2025 (the Notes ). In connection with the closing of the Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement, we redeemed all of the Notes remaining outstanding at a redemption price of 100.000 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, August 26, 2024 (the Redemption Date ), in accordance with the Indenture, dated June 15, 2017 (the Indenture ), between us, certain subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch, as registrar and transfer agent and The Bank of New York Mellon acting through its London Branch, as trustee. As of the Redemption Date, the Notes were no longer deemed outstanding and interest on the Notes ceased to accrue. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 0.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the redemption of the Notes. 
 
 31 

European Debt 
 In connection with the acquisition of UNIWHEELS AG in 2017, we assumed 70.7 million of outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2023, 0.8 million of the assumed debt remained outstanding. The outstanding debt was repaid in full during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Redeemable Preferred Stock 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, preferred stock dividends of 3.4 million and 6.8 million were paid-in-kind, which increased the stated value of the preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the stated values of the preferred stock were 156.8 million and 150.0 million, and the corresponding carrying values were 276.5 million and 248.2 million. 
 The preferred shares will continue to accrue dividends at 9.0 on the stated value. The associated redemption premium on the increase in the stated value will be accreted from July 1, 2024 through September 14, 2025 using the interest method. The redemption value of the preferred stock will be the greater of (i) two times the stated value 156.8 million) plus any accrued unpaid dividends, currently 313.5 million as of September 30, 2024, or (ii) the product of the number of common shares into which the redeemable preferred stock could be converted (5.6 million shares currently) and the then current market price of the common stock. 
 The redeemable preferred stock may be redeemed at the holder s election on or after September 14, 2025 or upon the occurrence of a redemption event, provided we have cash legally available to pay such redemption. If we are unable to redeem the shares of preferred stock in full, any shares of preferred stock not redeemed would continue to receive an annual dividend of 9.0 on the stated value which would be payable quarterly. The Board of Directors would have to evaluate periodically our ability to make any redemption payments until the full redemption amount has been paid. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in the preferred shareholder rights, including conversion and redemption rights, from those described in Note 12 - Redeemable Preferred Stock in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Factoring Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than factoring of 97.5 million of our trade receivables. The collective limit under our factoring arrangements was 142.5 million as of September 30, 2024.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 7.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 20.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash used by operating activities was primarily due to lower earnings after taking into account the effect of the loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary in 2023, partially offset by changes in working capital. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 21.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 was 12.9 million lower than the same period in 2023 due to lower capital expenditures and the deconsolidation of subsidiary cash in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 146.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 was 122.1 million higher than the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in debt repayments of 452.3 million, an increase in financing costs paid of 9.0 million, a redemption premium paid on term loan repayment of 3.7 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from 
 32 

issuance of long-term debt of 337.3 million and a decrease in cash dividends paid as preferred stock dividends of 6.8 million were paid-in-kind during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Non-GAAP Finan cial Measures 
 In this Quarterly Report, we discuss three important measures that are not calculated according to U.S. GAAP: value added sales, value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange, and adjusted EBITDA. 
 Value added sales represents net sales less the value of aluminum and other costs, as well as outsourced service provider OSP costs that are included in net sales. Contractual arrangements with our customers allow us to pass on changes in aluminum and certain other costs. Value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange represents value added sales on a constant currency basis. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the current period amounts are translated using the prior year comparative period exchange rates, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. Value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange allows users of the financial statements to consider our net sales information both with and without the aluminum, other costs and OSP costs and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Management utilizes value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange as a key metric in measuring and evaluating the growth of the Company because it eliminates the volatility of the cost of aluminum and changes in foreign exchange rates. Management utilizes value added sales in calculating adjusted EBITDA margin to eliminate volatility of the cost of aluminum in evaluating year-over-year margin growth. 
 The following table reconciles our net sales, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to our value added sales and value added sales adjusted for foreign exchange:

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring charges and other closure costs and impairments of long-lived assets and investments, changes in fair value of the redeemable preferred stock embedded derivative, acquisition and integration, certain hiring and separation related costs, proxy contest fees, gains and losses associated with early debt extinguishment and accounts receivable factoring fees. We use adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is used in our internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe the adjusted EBITDA financial measure assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage our business, to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace and to establish operational goals. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to apply significant judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein, as well as financial information included in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, industry trends, terms of various past and present agreements and contracts, and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent through other sources. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Critical accounting estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described in the management s discussion and analysis in our 2023 Form 10-K (refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be 
 34 

disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 35 

PART II 
 OTHER INF ORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are party to various legal and environmental proceedings incidental to our business. Certain claims, suits and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are pending against us. Based on facts now known, except as provided below, we believe all such matters are adequately provided for, are covered by insurance, are without merit, and/or involve such amounts that would not materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
 In March 2022, the German Federal Cartel Office initiated an investigation related to European light alloy wheel manufacturers, including Superior Industries Europe AG (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company), on suspicion of conduct restricting competition. The Company is cooperating fully with the German Federal Cartel Office. In the event Superior Industries Europe AG is deemed to have violated the applicable statutes, the Company could be subject to a fine or civil proceedings. At this point, we are unable to predict the duration or the outcome of the investigation. 
 On August 31, 2023 (the Filing Date ), the Company s then-owned subsidiary Superior Industries Production Germany GmbH SPG filed voluntary petitions for preliminary insolvency proceedings (equivalent to Chapter 11 under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) in the Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, Germany Insolvency Court (the Insolvency Court seeking relief under the German Insolvency Code (the Insolvency Code ). SPG filed motions with the Insolvency Court seeking authorization to continue to operate its business as a debtor-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Insolvency Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Insolvency Code and orders of the Insolvency Court. On November 21, 2023, upon the request of the managing directors of SPG, the Insolvency Court ordered the withdrawal from the preliminary self-administrative insolvency proceedings and the continuation in preliminary ordinary proceedings (equivalent to Chapter 7 under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). On December 1, 2023, the Insolvency Court passed a resolution to terminate the preliminary phase and to open ordinary insolvency proceedings with respect to SPG. On October 1, 2024, the Company and the insolvency administrator entered into a final settlement agreement to settle certain losses incurred by SPG as a result of continuing production to ensure the Company s supply to its customers. 
 Refer also to Item 1A, Risk Factors We are from time to time subject to litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
