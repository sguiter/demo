 There were no securities transferred into or out of Level 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 The following is a description, including valuation methodology, of the financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 
 Cash Equivalents 
 Cash equivalents consisted of cash invested in short-term money market funds and debt securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. When quoted prices are available in an active market, cash equivalents are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.

 . Also in connection with the Knopp Amendment, the Company agreed to issue to Knopp additional common shares of the Company with an approximate value of within days of the first anniversary of execution of the Knopp Amendment (the 2025 Additional Consideration ). In addition, Knopp has the option to request a one-time cash true-up payment from the Company in December 2025, as defined in the agreement (the "2025 Knopp True-up"). See Note 10, "License, Acquisitions and Other Agreements," for further details. 
 Change in fair value of forward contract and derivative liabilities in other income, net 
 ) Fair value at September 30, 2024 
 
 The fair value of the forward contract and remaining derivative liability recognized in connection with the Knopp Amendment were determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and therefore represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation is based on a Monte Carlo simulation of Biohaven's share price, which requires judgement and assumption on the volatility of Biohaven's share price, discounted to present value using a risk-free rate plus Biohaven specific credit risk since payable in a variable number of shares for the 2025 Additional Consideration or potentially cash for the 2025 Knopp True-up. 
 Volatility (annual) 
 Discount rate 
 
 Our expectations of the volatility of Biohaven's share price at the reporting date could be materially different than our actual future volatility, and if so, would mean the estimated fair value could be significantly higher or lower than the fair value determined. The Company expects the fair value of the forward contract to be approximately on the first anniversary of the Knopp Amendment. An increase in the derivative liability related to the 2025 Knopp True-up between the reporting date and settlement date of the derivative would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.

 Clinical-Stage Milestones 
 Our clinical-stage milestones include the following: 

Glutamate Modulation Platform 
 The most advanced product candidate from our glutamate receptor antagonist platform is troriluzole (previously referred to as trigriluzole and BHV-4157), which is currently in two Phase 3 trials in OCD and, for which, we plan to submit a new drug application NDA in Spinocerebellar Ataxia SCA to the U.S. FDA and have submitted a marketing authorisation application ("MAA") in SCA Type 3 ("SCA3") to the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"). Troriluzole is also being evaluated by the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research ("GCAR") as part of Glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment - NCT03970447 ("GBM AGILE"), a revolutionary patient-centered, adaptive platform trial for registration that tests multiple therapies for patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma ("GBM"). Other product candidates include BHV-5500, which is an antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptor and its oral prodrug BHV-5000. 
 Troriluzole 
 Spinocerebellar Ataxia 
 SCAs are a group of ultra-rare, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders predominantly characterized by atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. The disease course of SCA is one of relentless progression over years and inevitably leads to clinical deterioration of motor function, gait imbalance with frequent falling, severe speech impairment, 

swallowing difficulties, and premature death. SCAs are thought to be pathogenetically related but disease course and brain region involvement are known to vary between the different genotypes. SCA affects approximately 15,000 people in the United States and 24,000 in Europe and the United Kingdom. SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is the most common genotype, and accounts for approximately 30 to 50 of SCAs worldwide. Currently, there are no approved symptomatic or neuroprotective treatments for SCA. 
 In May 2022, the Company announced top-line results from the Phase 3 clinical trial (Study BHV4157-206) evaluating the efficacy and safety of its investigational therapy, troriluzole, in patients with SCA. The primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 48 on the modified functional Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia ("f-SARA"), did not reach statistical significance in the overall SCA population as there was less than expected disease progression in the placebo arm over the course of the study. Preliminary post hoc analysis of efficacy measures by genotype suggested a treatment effect in patients with the SCA3 genotype (p=0.045, LSM difference from placebo). A risk reduction in falls was also observed in the SCA3 population, as well as across all SCA genotypes. Troriluzole was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. 
 Based on the findings of further analyses performed and the debilitating nature of SCA, in May 2023 we announced that we submitted a New Drug 

28 

Table of Contents 

 Application ("NDA") to the FDA for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA3. In July 2023, the FDA informed us that it would not review the recently submitted NDA application for troriluzole given that the study's primary endpoint was not met and thus, would not permit a substantive review. In followup to the regulatory decision on the NDA application, we held followup meetings with the FDA regarding the SCA data. 
 In October, 2023, the EMA informed us that our Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") for troriluzole (Dazluma) in the treatment of SCA3 has been validated and is now under review by EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"). In the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed a clarification meeting with the CHMP Rapporteurs. The MAA documents are now being updated with a broader indication to include all SCA genotypes, in light of the new positive BHV4157-206-RWE study data (discussed below). 
 In September 2024, we announced positive topline results from pivotal Study BHV4157-206-RWE (NCT06529146) demonstrating the efficacy of troriluzole on the mean change from baseline in the f-SARA after 3 years of treatment. The study achieved the primary endpoint and showed statistically significant improvements on the f-SARA at years 1 and 2 and 3 (see figure below). 
 
 Collectively, data across multiple analyses demonstrate a robust and clinically meaningful slowing of disease progression in SCA patients. These treatment benefits translate into a 50-70 slower rate of decline compared to untreated patients, representing 1.5-2.2 years delay in disease progression over the 3-year study period. Additionally, in a responder sensitivity analysis, disease progression when defined by a 2 point or greater worsening on the f-SARA at 3 years showed an odds ratio ("OR") of 4.1 (95 CI: 2.1, 8.1) for the untreated external control arm versus troriluzole treated subjects (p 
 
 Based upon the topline data from Study BHV4157-206-RWE, and previous safety and efficacy data from the troriluzole development program in SCA,

 we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2024. The troriluzole development program has generated the largest clinical trial dataset in SCA and now has follow-up in some patients treated with troriluzole for over 5 years. We previously received both Fast-Track and Orphan drug designation ("ODD") from the FDA, and ODD from the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), for troriluzole in SCA. An NDA with ODD is eligible for priority FDA review. We will be prepared to commercialize SCA in the US in 2025, if ultimately approved, based on potential priority review timelines. 
 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder 
 We commenced a Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in adults with OCD in December 2017. The Phase 2/3 study results were announced in June 2020. Troriluzole 200 mg administered once daily as adjunctive therapy in OCD patients with inadequate response to standard of care treatment showed consistent numerical improvement over placebo on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at all study timepoints (weeks 4 to 12) but did not meet the primary outcome measure at week 12. Troriluzole treated subjects (n = 111) had a mean Y-BOCS improvement of -3.4 points from baseline versus -2.9 for placebo-treated (n = 115) subjects [difference -0.5 and p-value = 0.451] at week 4, -5.1 points (n = 96) versus -3.6 for placebo-treated (n = 108) subjects [difference -1.5 and p-value = 0.041] at week 8, and -5.9 points (n = 99) versus -4.9 for placebo-treated (n = 102) subjects [difference -1.0 and p-value = 0.220] at week 12. Troriluzole s safety profile was generally consistent with past clinical trial experience with its active metabolite, riluzole. Treatment emergent adverse events TEAE s) were mostly reported to be mild in intensity. TEAEs that occurred in at least 5 of patients in the troriluzole group, and more frequently in the troriluzole group than in the placebo group, were headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, nausea and nasopharyngitis. 
 Given the strong signal in the Phase 2/3 proof of concept study and after receiving feedback from the FDA in an End of Phase 2 meeting, in December 2020 we initiated enrollment in a Phase 3 program. The Phase 3 program will have an estimated total enrollment of up to 700 participants in each trial with a primary endpoint of change from baseline on the Y-BOCS total score at week 4, 8 and 10. The two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that make-up our Phase 3 program for OCD are currently ongoing. 
 In January 2024, we announced plans to conduct a pre-planned interim analysis ("IA") to evaluate efficacy in the first of our two Phase 3 studies in OCD. The IA was planned to be conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee after approximately 70 of subjects in the primary analysis population reached the primary endpoint. The Data Monitoring Committee convened in the second quarter of 2024 to review the IA and informed the Company that the study may continue. As such, we continue enrolling patients in the first 

Phase 3 study in OCD and expect that this study will be fully enrolled in the first quarter of 2025. We expect to report topline data from the first Phase 3 study in OCD in the first half of 2025. 
 There is a similarly designed pre-planned IA for the second Phase 3 study in OCD, with topline results from this IA anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Glioblastoma 
 In December 2021, GCAR selected troriluzole for evaluation in GBM AGILE. GBM AGILE is a revolutionary patient-centered, adaptive platform trial for registration that tests multiple therapies for patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent GBM, the most fatal form of brain cancer. Troriluzole will be evaluated in all patient subgroups of the trial which include newly-diagnosed methylated MGMT, newly-diagnosed unmethylated MGMT, and recurrent GBM. Troriluzole was selected for inclusion in GBM AGILE based on compelling evidence showing deregulation of glutamate in GBM. The therapeutic potential of troriluzole in GBM and other oncology indications is supported by several recent clinical and translational research studies conducted with troriluzole and its active moiety. 
 In July 2022, the Company and GCAR announced that enrollment has commenced in GBM AGILE for the evaluation of troriluzole. The study is currently ongoing. 
 
 Myostatin Platform 
 Taldefgrobep Alfa (BHV-2000) 
 In February 2022, we announced a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa (also known as BMS-986089 and now referred to as BHV-2000), a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. Myostatin is a natural protein that limits skeletal muscle growth, an important process in healthy muscular development that can lead to improvements of lean mass and loss of adipose tissue by acting through the activin receptor type-2B ("ActRIIb"). In patients with neuromuscular diseases, active myostatin can critically limit the growth needed to achieve developmental and functional milestones. Myostatin inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle mass and strength in a range of pediatric and adult neuromuscular conditions. In addition, preclinical and early clinical data suggest that blocking myostatin and downstream signaling through its receptors on skeletal muscle may produce physical and metabolic changes that are important to individuals living with overweight and obesity, including reducing body fat and improving insulin sensitivity while increasing lean muscle mass. Taldefgrobep s novel mode of action inhibiting both myostatin directly and through the ActRIIb and its unique impact on body composition suggest it could be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-obesity medications.

 Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
 In July 2022, we commenced enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical trial of BHV-2000 assessing the efficacy and safety of taldefgrobep alfa in Spinal Muscular Atrophy ("SMA"). SMA is a rare, progressively debilitating motor neuron disease in which development and growth of muscle mass are compromised, resulting in progressive weakness and muscle atrophy, reduced motor function, impaired quality of life and often death. The Phase 3 placebo-controlled, double-blind trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of taldefgrobep as an adjunctive therapy for participants who are already taking a stable dose of nusinersen or risdiplam or have a history of treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma), compared to placebo. The study is neither restricted nor limited to patients based on ambulatory status or classification of SMA and is designed to randomize approximately 180 patients in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled global trial. Baseline characteristics of the population enrolled in the ongoing Phase 3 study in SMA were reported and confirmed to be well matched to the target clinical population. The 

primary endpoint of the study, the 32 Item Motor Function Measurement, is a reliable and validated endpoint for measuring clinically meaningful benefit in SMA. We expect to report topline data from our Phase 3 study in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In February 2023, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for taldefgrobep alfa for the treatment of SMA. In December 2022, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for taldefgrobep in the treatment of SMA. In July 2023, we received orphan drug designation from the European Commission for taldefgrobep alfa in the treatment of SMA. 
 In April 2024, we announced that the FDA granted "rare pediatric disease" designation for taldefgrobep alfa. The designation provides for the potential for taldefgrobep to receive a priority review voucher PRV if ultimately approved for the indication of SMA prior to September 30, 2026. The rare pediatric disease PRV program will begin to sunset in December of 2024 and will not apply for approvals after September 30, 2026. 

Metabolic Disorders 
 Obesity is a disease of excess and/or abnormal deposits of adipose tissue and a current global public health crisis. By 2030, it is expected that nearly one billion people will be living with obesity, including 50 of the adult and 25 of the adolescent US population. The primary driver of obesity-related morbidity and mortality is metabolically active visceral adipose tissue and associated deposits of adipose tissue in and around organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys, and muscle. 
 Preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated the potential for anti-myostatin therapies to produce physical and metabolic changes that are highly relevant to individuals living with overweight and obesity, including reducing total body fat and visceral adiposity, and improving insulin sensitivity and bone mineral density, while increasing lean muscle mass. 
 In October 2023, we announced preclinical data demonstrating the ability of taldefgrobep alfa to significantly reduce fat mass while increasing lean mass in an obese mouse model. In a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, untreated mice exhibited an increase in fat mass of 31 , while the mice treated with taldefgrobep alfa demonstrated increases in lean mass of 25 from baseline (p .0.001) and lost 11 of their baseline fat (p .0.001) compared to vehicle (placebo) treated mice. Insulin and leptin levels were consistently lower in mice treated with taldefgrobep alfa compared to the untreated mice. There was no difference in food intake over time across the taldefgrobep alfa and untreated mice, counter to what has been observed with incretin mimetics (e.g., semaglutide) which are consistently associated with a reduction in energy intake.

 In May 2024, we announced preclinical data from a diet induced obesity mouse model, which showed treatment with taldefgrobep alfa together with a glucagon-like peptide-1 ("GLP-1") agonist produced greater reductions in body weight and fat mass, and a larger increase in lean muscle mass, compared to treatment with GLP-1 alone (see figure below). 
 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of taldefgrobep in the management of metabolic disease in the fourth quarter of 2024 or early 2025. The study will evaluate the ability of taldefgrobep to maintain lean mass muscle as an adjunctive to standard of care GLP-1 therapy in adults living with overweight and obesity. We are evaluating and have not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including size and primary and secondary endpoints. 

Ion Channel Platform 
 
 Kv7 
 BHV-7000 
 In April 2022, we closed the acquisition from Knopp Biosciences LLC Knopp of Channel Biosciences, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Knopp owning the assets of Knopp s Kv7 channel targeting platform, pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated February 24, 2022 (the "Purchase Agreement"). The acquisition of the Kv7 channel targeting platform added the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061), the lead asset from the Kv7 platform is an activator of Kv7.2/Kv7.3, a key ion channel involved in neuronal signaling and in regulating the hyperexcitable state in epilepsy. 
 In the second quarter of 2022, our Clinical Trial Application for BHV-7000 was approved by Health Canada, and we subsequently began Phase 1 clinical development. First-in-human single ascending dose ("SAD") and multiple ascending dose ("MAD") studies have now been completed. BHV-7000 was well-tolerated at all dose levels in both studies with no SAEs and no dose-limiting toxicities. 
 In 2023, we initiated a Phase 1 open-label electroencephalogram ("EEG") study designed to evaluate the effects of BHV-7000 on changes from baseline in EEG spectral power after administration of single doses of BHV-7000 (10, 25, or 50 mg) to healthy adult volunteers. BHV-7000 was well-tolerated at all doses studied and EEG data showed dose-dependent increases in brain spectral power, with minimal power increase in the delta frequency band and the highest spectral power increases in the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. The minimal impact of BHV-7000 on slower frequencies (i.e., delta) is consistent with the low incidence of central nervous system ("CNS") adverse events, in particular somnolence, seen in the BHV-7000 Phase 1 SAD/MAD studies, and the study results confirm the CNS activity of BHV-7000 at projected therapeutic concentrations. 
 Based on the results from the EEG study and the safety profile in SAD/MAD trials, along with PK data from a new once-daily extended-release ER formulation, Biohaven plans on exploring three oral dose levels of once-daily BHV-7000 (25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg) in the Phase 2/3 clinical trials in epilepsy and mood disorders. This dosing approach with a Kv7 activator will allow for assessment of distinct target concentrations over a wide range, above and below EC50 drug concentrations efficacious in nonclinical models, not previously feasible with drugs in this class.

 Epilepsy 
 Epilepsy affects approximately 3.5 million Americans, or more than 1.2 of adults and 0.6 of children in the U.S., and more than 50 million patients worldwide, according to the World Health Organization WHO ). It is the fourth most common neurological disorder, and many patients struggle to achieve freedom from seizures, with more than one third of patients requiring two or more medications to manage their epilepsy. While the use of anti-seizure medications is often accompanied by dose-limiting side effects, our clinical candidate BHV-7000 is specifically designed to target subtypes of Kv7 potassium channels without engagement of GABAA receptors. The lack of GABAA-R activity potentially gives BHV-7000 a wide therapeutic window which we expect to result in an improved side effect profile, limiting the somnolence and fatigue often seen in patients receiving anti-seizure medications. We aim to bring this potassium channel modulator as a potential solution to patients with epilepsy who remain uncontrolled on their current regimens. 
 In January 2024, we completed our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to advance to Phase 3 trials and announced that more than 110 global clinical sites have been selected in the first of two focal epilepsy trials. Enrollment in our Phase 2/3 program commenced in the first quarter of 2024. The two pivotal studies evaluating the efficacy of BHV-7000 in refractory focal epilepsy are planned as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8- and 12-week trials with a primary endpoint of change from baseline in 28-day average seizure frequency in adults with focal epilepsy. One of the focal epilepsy studies will evaluate 25 mg and 50 mg doses of BHV-7000 and the second study will evaluate 50 mg and 75 mg doses of BHV-7000 (see figure below). 
 
 In addition to the focal epilepsy program, we initiated a Phase 2/3 study of BHV-7000 in idiopathic generalized epilepsy ("IGE") in the second quarter of 2024. The pivotal study evaluating the efficacy of BHV-7000 with IGE is planned

 as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week time-to-event trial with a primary endpoint of time to second generalized seizure in adults and adolescents with IGE (see figure below). 
 
 Mood Disorders 
 Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US are living with neuropsychiatric illnesses that are, in turn, associated with inadequate treatment, poor quality of life, disability, and considerable direct and indirect costs. There is significant unmet need for novel and effective therapeutic options that are not limited by long latency periods to clinical effects, low response rates, and significant risks and side effects. Increasing evidence from animal models and clinical trials now suggests that Kv7.2/7.3 targeting drugs offer the potential to treat a spectrum of these neuropsychiatric diseases including, but not limited to, mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder ("MDD") and bipolar disorder. 
 Major Depressive Disorder 
 We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial with BHV-7000 for the treatment of MDD in the second quarter of 2024. The study is a 6 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 300 subjects, with a primary endpoint of measurement on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ("MADRS"). See figure below for trial design.

 Bipolar disorder 
 We also initiated a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with BHV-7000 for the treatment of bipolar disorder in the second quarter of 2024. The study is a 3 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 256 subjects, with a primary endpoint of measurement on the Young Mania Rating Scale ("YMRS"). See figure below for trial design. 
 
 KCNQ2 Developmental Epileptic Encephalopathy 
 We are currently exploring BHV-7000 as a potential treatment for KCNQ2 developmental epileptic encephalopathy ("KCNQ2-DEE"), a rare pediatric epileptic encephalopathy first described in 2012 resulting from dominant-negative mutations in the KCNQ2 gene. BHV-7000 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA for the treatment of KCNQ2-DEE. 
 Neuropathic Pain 
 We are currently evaluating the activity of BHV-7000 and other compounds from our proprietary series of selective Kv7.2/7.3 activators in multiple preclinical models of neuropathic pain. 
 Migraine 
 We are currently exploring BHV-7000 as a potential treatment for migraine. Kv7.2/7.3 openers have shown significant activity in cortical spreading depression models of migraine. 

TRPM3 Ion Channel Antagonists 
 In January 2022, we entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement with Katholieke Universiteit Leuven ("KU Leuven") to develop and commercialize TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders (the "KU Leuven Agreement"). The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, we receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, henceforth known as BHV-2100. 

BHV-2100 
 BHV-2100 is an orally-bioavailable small molecule antagonist of TRPM3. TRPM3 is expressed in the relevant human tissue types for pain and migraine, and both preclinical models and human genetics implicate TRPM3 in pain and migraine. 
 In May 2024, we reported positive pharmacokinetic and safety data from the completed Phase 1 study with BHV-2100. The results demonstrated rapid absorption with therapeutic concentrations achieved by 20 minutes. The favorable tolerability profile at single doses up to 500 mg exceeds the anticipated therapeutic dose and is well above the EC90 concentration. Based on these findings, we have initiated a Phase 2 study of BHV-2100 in the acute treatment of migraine and a proof-of-concept study in pain in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Migraine 
 In September 2024, we announced that we have initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating BH-2100 in the acute treatment of migraine. The study is a 45-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 575 subjects, with primary endpoints of freedom from pain at two hours post-dose and freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours post-dose. See figure below for trial design.

Neuropathic Pain 
 BHV-2100 is also being developed as a potential non-opioid treatment for neuropathic pain. We are evaluating the ability of BHV-2100 to reduce pain behaviors across several preclinical models of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy induced neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and nerve injury. The Company initiated a proof of concept study for neuropathic pain in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The study is a Phase-1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active reference controlled, crossover trial to assess the anti-nociceptive and anti-hyperalgesic effects of single oral doses of BHV-2100 (25 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg) vs. placebo, in a cohort of approximately 24 healthy male volunteer participants, utilizing a laser-evoked potential experimental pain paradigm. 
 Additional research on TRPM3-mediated disorders 
 Under the KU Leuven Agreement, Biohaven is supporting further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders. In addition to BHV-2100, we are optimizing other lead compounds for TRPM3-mediated disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems. 
 
 Inflammation and Immunology Platform 
 
 TYK2/JAK1 
 Agreement with Hangzhou Highlightll Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 
 In March 2023, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide (excluding People s Republic of China and its territories and possessions) license agreement with Hangzhou Highlightll Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. ("Highlightll"), pursuant to which we obtained the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize Highlightll s brain penetrant dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor program (the "Highlightll Agreement"). 

BHV-8000 
 Dysregulation of the immune system has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and autoimmune encephalitis. Over-active immune cells and microglia driving chronic neuroinflammation resulting in release of cytokines with activation of leukocytes that are thought to contribute to neuronal injury, death, gliosis, and demyelination. The TYK2 and JAK1 signal transduction pathways mediate highly complementary immune and inflammatory signaling events. Targeted, small-molecule therapies that inhibit TYK2 or JAK kinases have separately demonstrated robust efficacy in autoimmune, dermatologic and gastrointestinal disorders. TYK2 is a validated immune target as evidenced by a recent peripheral program that gained FDA approval, and there are multiple additional peripheral non-CNS programs in clinical development. Brain penetrant inhibitors of TYK2/JAK1 have the potential to bring this validated immune target to brain disorders. 
 There are currently no brain penetrant, selective, dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors approved for brain disorders. In May 2023, we began dosing with BHV-8000 (previously TLL-041), in a Phase 1 study in normal healthy volunteers. In May 2024, we reported positive results from the Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose study with BHV-8000 in healthy subjects, including evidence of target engagement along with a safe and well tolerated profile. The Phase 1 study also confirmed cerebrospinal fluid ("CSF") exposures of BHV-8000 and evidence of biomarker target engagement within the CNS. We also announced the successful completion of two FDA meetings with favorable feedback enabling registrational programs for Parkinson's disease and for the prevention of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities ("ARIA"), a novel indication. 
 We anticipate beginning Phase 2/3 clinical trials with BHV-8000 in the first half of 2025 targeting

 neuroinflammatory conditions, potentially including Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities ("ARIA") in Alzheimer s disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. We are evaluating and have not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including size and primary and secondary endpoints. 
 
 MoDE Degraders 
 Bispecific Molecular Degraders of Extracellular Proteins 
 Molecular Degraders of Extracellular Proteins MoDEs are bispecific molecules that target pathologic circulating proteins and direct them to the liver for degradation by the endolysosomal pathway. Our MoDE platform is being explored for use in a wide range of therapeutic areas, including indications in immune-mediated diseases, cancer and other diseases. We are planning for MoDEs to be administered as intravenous or subcutaneous formulations. We expect to initiate a total of 4 Investigational New Drug Applications or the foreign equivalent ("IND") for the degrader program in 2024. 
 BHV-1300 
 BHV-1300 is an IgG degrader which we are initially developing for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 

("RA"). RA is a chronic autoimmune disease estimated to affect 1 to 2 of the global population. RA primarily affects the joints, causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function. 
 We evaluated the effect of single and multiple doses of BHV-1300 in cynomolgus monkeys. In September 2023, we reported data from confirmatory studies that showed a 75-80 reduction of IgG levels two days after a single dose and over 90 of IgG lowering after three doses. 

Maximal lowering across FcRn inhibitors is 60-80 within approximately 7 to 21 days after initiation of single or multiple doses, respectively, in cynomolgus. In contrast, a single dose of BHV-1300 lowers IgG by approximately 75 to 80 after approximately 2 days, and after three rapid doses to greater than 90 lowering. The length of significant exposure to BHV-1300 is approximately one day within the dosage interval compared to continuous exposure required of the FcRn inhibitors. Mechanism related liabilities of FcRn inhibitors seen in animals and man, including hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia, are not expected and do not occur with BHV-1300 in cynomolgus. See figures below comparing the speed and depth of lowering to FcRn inhibitors. 
 
 In January 2024, we reported preclinical pharmacodynamic single dose data with BHV-1300 which demonstrated the Biohaven IgG degrader technology allows for co-administration with Fc-containing biologics. The PK of Humira was unaltered

 after being dosed 12 hours after BHV-1300 administration (see figure below). 
 
 Adapted from BLA 761154, IND 116471, Study no. r-fkb327-01 
 The Phase 1 study examining BHV-1300 was initiated in the first quarter of 2024 and remains ongoing. In May 2024, we reported preliminary results from our Phase 1 study of BHV-1300. These results in healthy subjects reported that BHV-1300 rapidly and selectively lowers IgG in a dose-dependent manner in the first 4 cohorts completed to date (see figure below). Preliminary IgG lowering data is consistent with modeling, with dose- and time-dependent IgG lowering observed even in initial low-dose cohorts. Some subjects experienced IgG reductions as low as 50 to 70 of baseline. BHV-1300 demonstrated reduction of IgG without significantly impacting LFTs, albumin, LDL cholesterol or other serum labs. BHV-1300 has been safe and well tolerated to date, with no serious or severe adverse events. Most AEs were mild, deemed unrelated to study drug and resolved spontaneously. As expected from the selectivity of the molecule for IgG, when compared to placebo, there were no meaningful reductions in average IgA, IgM or IgE levels during the week after dosing. No adverse trends have been observed in vital signs or ECGs. Modeling suggests additional cohorts in the Phase 1 study will achieve greater than 70 lowering of IgG utilizing doses compatible with subcutaneous administration. 

The Phase 1 study has also compared intravenous and subcutaneous administration of BHV-1300. Subcutaneous administration of BHV-1300 demonstrated an average of approximately 44 higher than expected exposure compared to the dose-equivalent intravenous formulation without injection site reactions. This new human data confirms the feasibility of the Company's plan for convenient dosing of BHV-1300 with a patient self-administered subcutaneous auto-injector. The Company expects to provide an update from our SAD/MAD study by the end of 2024. 
 BHV-1310 
 BHV-1310 is a next generation bispecific IgG degrader with the same specificity as BHV-1300 for IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 which is initially being developed for the treatment of rare disorders including conditions like generalized myasthenia gravis ("gMG") and potentially other acute or chronic conditions, or chronic conditions with acute exacerbations or flares. 
 MG is a neuromuscular disorder that is estimated to affect approximately 36,000 to 60,000 people in the United States. Patients with gMG develop antibodies that attack critical signaling receptor proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, inhibiting communication between nerves and muscle and resulting in weakness of the skeletal muscles. 

38 

Table of Contents 

 In January 2024, we demonstrated optimization of degrader technology with BHV-1310 which allows for deeper reductions in IgG after single dose (see figure below). The deep and rapid reductions observed suggest that BHV-1310 could have potential application in acute settings. We expect to initiate Phase 1 studies of BHV-1310 in the fourth quarter of 2024. We are evaluating and have not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including size and primary and secondary endpoints. 
 
 BHV-1400 
 BHV-1400 is a selective MoDE which is being developed to target Gd-IgA1 for the treatment of IgA Nephropathy. Specific removal of pathogenic Gd-IgA1 and associated circulating immune complexes with preservation of normal IgA potentially permits disease remission without incurring an infection risk. We shared preliminary data demonstrating the chimeric antibody-ASGPR ligand conjugate specifically mediated endocytosis of Gd-IgA1, as opposed to normal IgA1 and IgA2, in an endocytosis assay with ASGPR-expressing cell lines, and that MoDE degraders successfully internalize and degrade these immune-complexes. We expect to initiate Phase 1 studies of BHV-1400 in the fourth quarter of 2024. We are evaluating and have not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including size and primary and secondary endpoints. 
 BHV-1600 
 BHV-1600 is a selective MoDE designed to remove circulating agonistic antibodies of all isotypes and subclasses directed against myocardial beta-1 adrenergic receptor (" -1 AR") through hepatic ASGPR binding and hepatocellular degradation. This molecule was created using a peptide that mimics the antigenic epitope common to most patients with autoantibodies directed to -1 AR. This peptide mimics the native sequence such that circulating antibodies are efficiently trapped and subsequently removed by hepatic endocytosis through the ASGPR receptor. 
 We are developing BHV-1600 for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition where the cardiac muscle contracts less effectively, the chambers of the heart are enlarged and thinning of cardiac walls results. This can lead to cardiac valvular incompetency, arrhythmias, thrombosis, and 

heart failure. We expect to initiate Phase 1 studies of BHV-1600 in the fourth quarter of 2024. We are evaluating and have not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including size and primary and secondary endpoints. 
 Additional Degraders 
 We are currently developing additional MoDE degraders which will advance to INDs in 2025. These include potential treatments for Type 1 diabetes with our degrader targeting anti-insulin and anti-proinsulin autoantibodies, kidney disease with our degrader targeting phospholipase A2 receptor ("PLA2R") antibodies for idiopathic membranous nephropathy, an IgG4 specific degrader to target IgG4-mediated rare diseases, and gene therapy administration optimization with our degrader to target neutralizing antibodies to Adeno-Associated Virus Serotype 9 ("AAV9"). 
 
 Oncology Platform 
 
 CD-38 
 BHV-1100 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1a/1b trial in multiple myeloma patients using its antibody recruiting molecule BHV-1100 in combination with autologous cytokine induced memory-like natural killer cells and immune globulin to target and kill multiple myeloma cells expressing the cell surface protein CD38. BHV-1100 is the lead clinical asset from Biohaven s Antibody Recruiting Molecule ("ARM ") Platform developed from a strategic alliance with PeptiDream Inc. ("PeptiDream") (TYO: 4587). This open-label single center Phase 1a/1b study will assess the safety and tolerability as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who have tested positive for minimal residual disease

 MRD+ in first or second remission prior to autologous stem cell transplant ASCT ). We plan to enroll 30 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. The primary outcome measures are dose limiting toxicities following combination product administration (time frame: 100 days post-combination product administration) and incidence and severity of side effects related to the combination product (time frame: 90 to 100 days post-combination product administration). 
 
 Antibody Drug Conjugates 
 BHV-1510 
 In January 2024, we acquired BHV-1510 through our acquisition of Pyramid Biosciences, Inc. ("Pyramid"). BHV-1510 is a next-generation Trophoblast Cell Surface Antigen 2 ("TROP-2") directed ADC employing an optimized next-generation construct with novel linker-payload and enzymatic, site-specific conjugation, targeting TROP2-expressing carcinomas. Carcinoma refers to a malignant neoplasm of epithelial origin. Carcinomas account for 80 to 90 percent of all cancer cases and several examples have been successfully treated with ADCs. Abundant TROP-2 expression has been described for many carcinoma subtypes. 
 In preclinical TROP-2 expressing tumor models, BHV-1510 has shown improved antitumor activity versus other TROP-2 directed ADCs, in addition to improved plasma stability, more potent in vitro cytotoxicity, superior bystander effect, and greater immunogenic cell death with the novel TopoIx payload. Improved and differentiated safety has been seen in cynomolgus monkey GLP toxicology studies, suggesting a wide therapeutic index. BHV-1510 has similar favorable characteristics to our proprietary MATE conjugation technology, which should allow highly stable site-specific conjugation, resulting in a favorable PK, toxicity and manufacturability profile. 
 The IND for BHV-1510 was approved by the FDA in January 2024. The First-in Human, Phase 1/2 trial evaluating BHV-1510 in patients with advanced solid tumors commenced in the second quarter of 2024. This trial consists of two parts; Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 dose expansion, in patients with advanced incurable cancer that have progressed on or are intolerant to standard therapy. The trial will also evaluate BHV-1510 in combination with the anti-PD1 cemiplimab. The primary objective of Phase 1 is safety, to identify a recommended dose for expansion ("RDE") or maximum tolerated dose. Phase 1 dose escalation will be implemented based on a Bayesian optimal interval design, with the lowest dose initiated as a single patient cohort. Patients are expected to be dosed in escalating cohorts, with dosing regimens administered intravenously every two or three weeks. The Phase 2 dose expansion part of the study will consist of non-randomized efficacy finding expansion cohorts, defined by specific tumor types that will be treated at the RDE to estimate the anti-tumor activity of BHV-1510. Up to approximately 220 subjects are planned to be evaluated. 

Preclinically, BHV-1510 has shown enhanced cellular cytotoxicity, bystander killing, and immunogenic cell death resulting in improved efficacy as monotherapy, and synergistic efficacy in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy. In IND-enabling studies, BHV-1510 also showed a broader therapeutic margin relative to more advanced Trop-2 ADCs, including a lack of lung toxicity, that may translate to an improved clinical efficacy and safety profile. In May 2024, we announced that we entered into a clinical supply agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Regeneron") under which we will sponsor and fund the planned combination clinical trial and Regeneron will provide Libtayo . Libtayo is a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein-1 ("PD-1"). 
 BHV-1500 
 BHV-1500 is a next-generation CD30-directed ADC employing a Biohaven proprietary site-specific conjugation (MATE reagent), targeting CD30-expressing tumors such as Hodgkin's and other lymphoma and the MMAE payload. Hodgkin's disease and other CD30-expressing lymphoma are characterized by the uncontrolled growth of malignant lymphocytes or lymphoblasts. Adcetris has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. 
 In preclinical CD30 expressing murine tumor models, BHV-1500 has shown improved antitumor activity versus Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), and substantially improved safety, plasma stability and pharmacokinetics in monkeys. We expect to submit an IND for BHV-1500 in 2025. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Amendment to Knopp Purchase Agreement 
 In May 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement with Knopp (the Knopp Amendment ). Under the Knopp Amendment, the parties thereto agreed to replace the scaled high single digit to low teens royalty payment obligations with a flat royalty payment in the mid-single digits for BHV-7000 and the pipeline programs. The parties also agreed to reduce the success-based payments payable under the Purchase Agreement by removing all commercial sales-based milestones, which were up to 562.5 million, and reducing the developmental and regulatory milestones, which were up to 575 million, to up to 210 million based on regulatory approvals in the United States and EMEA for BHV-7000 25 million of which has already been paid) and up to an additional 60 million based on regulatory approval in the United States for the other Kv7 pipeline programs. We retain the ability to pay these contingent milestone payments in cash or in Biohaven Shares at our election, subject to the same increases if we elect to pay in Biohaven Shares. 
 In consideration of the revisions to the success-based payment and royalty payment obligations, we agreed to issue to Knopp 1,872,874 Biohaven Shares,

 valued at approximately 75 million, through a private placement within 60 days of the date of execution of the Knopp Amendment (the 2024 Additional Consideration and additional Biohaven Shares with an approximate value of 75 million within 60 days of the first anniversary of execution of the Knopp Amendment (the 2025 Additional Consideration ). We also gave Knopp the option to request a one-time cash true-up payment from us in December 2024 in the event that Knopp continues to hold the Biohaven Shares representing the 2024 Additional Consideration and the value of such shares has declined, and a one-time cash true-up payment from us in December 2025 in the event that Knopp continues to hold the Biohaven Shares representing the 2025 Additional Consideration and the value of such shares has declined, in each case, subject to certain conditions. In May 2024, we issued the 2024 Additional Consideration at an approximate value of 66.0 million. 
 As further consideration for the revisions to the success-based payment and royalty payment obligations in the Knopp Amendment, we issued to Knopp a warrant (the Warrant to purchase 294,195 Biohaven Shares at a purchase price per share of 67.98, subject to certain specified development milestones and the Company achieving a specified market capitalization. 
 For further discussion of the Knopp Amendment, refer to Note 4, "Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities", Note 6, "Shareholders' Equity, " and Note 10, " License, Acquisitions and Other Agreements" to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or additional license agreements with third parties, then we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development ("R D") expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include: 
 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations ("CROs") or contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ), as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services; 

manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches; 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; 
 costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; 
 development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval of the product candidate; 
 rent and operating expenses incurred for leased lab facilities and equipment; and 
 payments made in cash, equity securities or other forms of consideration under third-party licensing or other agreements prior to regulatory approval of the product candidate. 
 We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using estimates from our clinical personnel and information provided to us by our service providers. 
 Our external direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product candidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs, and central laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses by program also include fees and certain development milestones incurred under license agreements. We do not allocate employee costs, or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to oversee the research and development as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. 
 Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will remain significant over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, conduct late-stage clinical trials, and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional expenses related to milestones payable to third parties with whom we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to our product candidates.

 The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of: 
 the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities; 
 establishment of an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies; 
 successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials; 
 the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 
 establishment of commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 
 development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial launch; 
 acquisition, maintenance, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 
 significant and changing government regulation; 
 initiation of commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 
 maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative ("G A") expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and travel expenses for our executive, finance, business, corporate development and other administrative functions; and non-cash share-based compensation expense. General and administrative expenses also include facilities and other related expenses, including rent, depreciation, maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; and for public relations, audit, tax and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection of our intellectual property. 
 We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses, including payroll and related expenses, will remain significant in the future as we continue to support our research and development activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our product 

candidates, if successfully developed and approved. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with general operations, including costs related to accounting and legal services, director and officer insurance premiums, facilities and other corporate infrastructure, and office-related costs, such as information technology costs, as well as ongoing additional costs associated with operating as an independent, publicly traded company. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net primarily consists of changes in the fair value of our forward contract and derivative liabilities and net investment income. 
 The fair value of the forward contracts and derivative liabilities recognized in connection with the Knopp Amendment are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation of the Company's stock price over the respective duration and terms of each instrument being valued. Refer to Note 4, "Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities" to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for detail on valuation inputs and methodology. The fair value of these liabilities are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in other income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Net investment income is comprised of interest income and net accretion and amortization on investments in addition to realized gains and losses. Refer to Note 3, "Marketable Securities," to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for further detail on our investments. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The income tax expense in the condensed consolidated financial statements was calculated on a separate return method and presented as if the Company s operations were separate taxpayers in the respective jurisdictions up to and including the Separation. Cash tax payments, income taxes receivable and deferred taxes, net of valuation allowance, are reflective of our actual tax balances prior and subsequent to the Separation. 
 As a company incorporated in the BVI, we are principally subject to taxation in the BVI. Under the current laws of the BVI, the Company and all dividends, interest, rents, royalties, compensation and other amounts paid by the Company to persons who are not resident in the BVI and any capital gains realized with respect to any shares, debt obligations, or other securities of the Company by persons who are not resident in the BVI are exempt from all provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance in the BVI. 
 We have historically outsourced all of the research and clinical development for our programs under a

Table of Contents 

 master services agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("BPI"). As a result of providing services under this agreement, BPI was profitable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. A similar arrangement is also in place for our subsidiary, Biohaven Biosciences Ireland Limited ("BBIL") also operates under a similar arrangement. Both Companies are subject to taxation in the US and Ireland, respectively. As such, in each reporting period, the tax provision includes the effects of the results of operations of BPI and BBIL. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, comprised primarily of research and development tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards, based on management s assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 Our income tax provisions primarily represent Federal and state taxes related to the profitable operations of our subsidiaries in the United States and Ireland.

 R D expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were 157.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 95.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 62.1 million was due to additional and advancing clinical trials, including late Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 studies, and preclinical research programs in 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Non-cash share-based compensation expense was 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.0 million as compared to the same period in 2023. Non-cash share-based compensation expense was higher in 2024 primarily due to our annual equity incentive awards granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 5.5 million was partly due to increased non-cash share-based compensation expense, which was 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.7 million as compared to the same period in 2023. Non-cash share-based compensation expense was higher in 2024 primarily due to our annual equity incentive awards granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. 

Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net was a net income of 17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to non-cash 12.1 million related to the changes in the fair value of our forward contract and derivative liabilities recorded in connection with the Knopp Amendment as well as increased investment income. See Note 4, "Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities" and Note 10, "License, Acquisitions and Other Agreements " to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for discussion of the forward contract and derivative liabilities recorded in connection with the Knopp Amendment. 
 Benefit for Income Taxes 
 We recorded an income tax benefit of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit for income taxes of 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to our adoption of the guidance contained in a Notice of Proposed Rule Making issued during the third quarter of 2023 by the United States Internal Revenue Service ("the Notice"). See further discussion of the Notice in Note 12, "Income Taxes" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q.

 R D expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were 628.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 238.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 389.9 million was largely due to non-cash expense of 171.9 million paid to Knopp for a milestone and royalty buyback related to the BHV-7000 and broader Kv7 platform that was recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024 (the buyback reduced our potential future milestone payments by 867.5 million, and replaced the scaled high single digit to low teens royalty payment obligations with a flat royalty payment in the mid-single digits for the Kv7 programs). See further discussion of the Knopp Amendment included in Note 10, "License, Acquisitions and Other Agreements" to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. The increase in expense was also related to advancing our 6 clinical platforms including 5 phase 3 starts for BHV-7000, follow-on Kv7 assets, preclinical research programs, and increases in direct program spend for additional and advancing multiple clinical development programs in 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The 25.7 million increase in expense for BHV-1510 was primarily due to the Pyramid Acquisition, which resulted in 10.9 million (non-cash) of expense recorded to R D during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 1.5 million milestone payment which became due during the first quarter of 2024, and a 5.7 million non-cash milestone payment which became due during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Non-cash share-based compensation expense was 35.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 28.6 million as compared to the same period in 2023. Non-cash share-based compensation expense was higher in the 2024 primarily due to our annual equity incentive awards granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 G A expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were 66.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 43.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 22.9 million was primarily due to increased non-cash share-based compensation expense. Non-cash share-based compensation expense was 23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 17.7 million as compared to the same period in 2023. Non-cash share-based compensation expense was higher in 2024 primarily due to our annual equity incentive awards being granted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net was 36.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to non-cash 21.2 million related to the changes in the fair value of our forward contract and derivative liabilities recorded in 

connection with the Knopp Amendment as well as increased investment income. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of 6.8 million in other income recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 related to the Transition Services Agreement entered into with the Former Parent. See Note 4, "Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities" and Note 10, "License, Acquisitions and Other Agreements " to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for discussion of the forward contract and derivative liabilities recorded in connection with the Knopp Amendment. 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 We recorded an income tax provision of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily attributable higher income in the US. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials and seek regulatory approval and pursue commercialization of any approved product candidate. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition, we may incur expenses in connection with the in-license or acquisition of additional product candidates 
 Historically, we have funded our operations primarily with the cash contribution received from the Former Parent at the Separation and proceeds from the sale of our common shares. We have incurred recurring losses since our inception and expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 84.4 million and marketable securities of 294.4 million, which excludes approximately 269.9 million of net proceeds from an October 2, 2024 underwritten public offering (see 2024 Public Offerings). Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in marketable securities and money market funds with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. We continuously assess our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, and future investments or acquisitions.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 411.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 216.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 194.9 million increase in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in R D spending to advance our 6 clinical platforms including 5 phase 3 starts for BHV-7000, follow-on Kv7 assets, preclinical research programs, and increases in direct program spend for additional and advancing multiple clinical development programs in 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 157.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 133.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 291.0 million increase in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in purchases of marketable securities with cash in excess of immediate requirements, partially offset by an increase in maturities of marketable securities (see Note 3, "Marketable Securities," to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details), as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 404.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 33.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 438.2 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended 

September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common shares from our April 2024 public equity offering and at-the-market sales of common shares in connection with our Equity Distribution Agreement both in 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 2024 Public Offerings 
 On April 22, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering of 6,451,220 of its common shares, which included the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of 41.00 per share. The net proceeds raised in the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses of the offering payable by us, were approximately 247.8 million. We intend to use the net proceeds received from the offering for general corporate purposes. 
 On October 2, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering of 6,052,631 of our common shares, which included the exercise in full of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a price of 47.50 per share. The net proceeds raised in the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses of the offering payable by us, were approximately 269.9 million. We intend to use the net proceeds received from the offering for general corporate purposes. 
 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 In October 2023, we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 150.0 million from time to time through or to the sales agent, acting as our agent or principal (the "Equity Distribution Agreement"). Sales of our common shares, if any, will be made in sales deemed to be at-the-market offerings . The sales agent is not required to sell any specific amount of securities but will act as our sales agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between the sales agent and us. We currently plan to use the net proceeds from any at-the-market offerings of our common shares for general corporate purposes. 
 In August 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Equity Distribution Agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 450.0 million from time to time through or to the sales agent, acting as its agent or principal. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have sold and issued 4,248,588 common shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement, as amended, for total net proceeds of approximately 146.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, additional common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 300.0 million remain available to be issued.

 Knopp Amendment 
 In May 2024, we entered into the Knopp Amendment which reduced our potential future milestone payments by 867.5 million, and replaced the scaled high single digit to low teens royalty payment obligations with a flat royalty payment in the mid-single digits for our Kv7 programs. As consideration, we agreed to issue to Knopp the 2024 Additional Consideration and 2025 Additional Consideration, both non-cash common share payments, as well as agreed to one-time cash-true ups for both the 2024 Additional Consideration and 2025 Additional Consideration. See Recent Developments elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the Knopp Amendment. 
 On May 30, we issued 1,872,874 common shares valued at 66.0 million to Knopp to settle the forward contract liability related to the 2024 Additional Consideration and recognized a non-cash gain of 9.2 million on settlement. We expect to issue the common shares representing the 2025 Additional Consideration on or before June 30, 2025, in accordance with the Knopp Amendment. 
 In the event that Knopp continues to hold the shares of the Company's common shares representing the 2025 Additional Consideration on December 1, 2025 and the Market Price declines relative to the respective Reference Price, both as defined in the agreement, we would be responsible for a cash payment equal to the difference.

 As further consideration under the Knopp Amendment, we issued to Knopp a warrant to purchase 294,195 of the Company's common shares with a purchase price of 67.98, subject to certain specified development milestones and the Company achieving a specified market capitalization. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the vesting conditions have not been met and the warrant is still outstanding. 
 
 Funding Requirements 
 We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance and expand preclinical activities, clinical trials and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Our costs will also increase as we: 
 continue to advance and expand the development of our discovery programs and clinical-stage assets; 
 continue to initiate and progress other supporting studies required for regulatory approval of our product candidates, including long-term safety studies, drug-drug interaction studies, preclinical toxicology and carcinogenicity studies; 

initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional indications for our current product candidates and any future product candidates that we may pursue; 
 continue to build our portfolio of product candidates through the acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 
 continue to develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 
 pursue regulatory approvals for our current and future product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 
 establish and support our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval; and 
 hire additional clinical, medical, commercial, and development personnel. 
 We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, will be sufficient to fund operating and financial commitments and other cash requirements for more than one year. We expect we will need to raise additional capital until we are profitable. If no additional capital is raised through either public or private equity financings, debt financings, strategic relationships, alliances and licensing agreements, or a combination thereof, we may delay, limit or reduce discretionary spending in areas related to research and development activities and other general and administrative expenses in order to fund our operating costs and working capital needs. 
 We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize or whether we commercialize jointly or on our own. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

48 

Table of Contents 

 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 
 the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth; 
 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 
 the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; 
 the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any; and 
 other capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and other general corporate activities. 
 Until such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Except as discussed in Note 11, "Commitments and Contingencies" to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1, Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as included in our audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 We have prepared our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 

("GAAP"). Our preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Excluding the discussion below, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies as reported in our annual consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Valuation of Forward Contract and Derivative Liabilities 
 We have accounted for certain consideration agreed to in connection with the Knopp Amendment as forward contracts and derivative liabilities. The fair value of these liabilities have been determined based on Monte Carlo simulations of Biohaven's share price, which requires judgment and assumptions on the volatility of our share price, discounted to present value using a risk-free rate plus Biohaven specific credit risk as they are payable in either cash or a variable number of shares. 
 Our expectations of the volatility of Biohaven's share price at the reporting date could be materially different than our actual future volatility, and if so, would mean the estimated fair value could be significantly higher or lower than the fair value determined. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations, if applicable, is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing at the beginning of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 Our operations include activities in countries outside the U.S. As a result, our financial results are impacted by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets where we operate. Our monetary exposures on our balance sheet are currently immaterial to our financial position as of September 30, 2024. 

49 

Table of Contents 

 We do not engage in any hedging activities against changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities of highly rated financial institutions and investment-grade debt instruments. We seek to diversify our investments and limit the amount of investment concentrations for individual institutions, maturities and investment types. Most of our interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate. Based on the type of securities we hold, we do not believe a change in interest rates would have a material impact on our financial statements. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1.00 , the fair value of our investment portfolio would (decrease) increase by approximately (0.5) million and 0.5 million, respectively. 
 We do not engage in any hedging activities against changes in interest rates. 
 Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term debt securities. The Company maintains a portion of its cash deposits in government insured institutions in excess of government insured limits. The Company deposits its cash in financial institutions that it believes have high credit quality and has not experienced any losses on such accounts. The Company's cash management policy permits investments in U.S. federal government and federal agency securities, corporate bonds or commercial paper, supranational and sovereign obligations, certain qualifying money market mutual funds, certain repurchase agreements, and places restrictions on credit ratings, maturities, and concentration by type and issuer. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding its cash in excess of government insured limits and in the event of default by corporations and governments in which it holds investments in cash equivalents and short-term debt securities, to the extent recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 We have not experienced any credit losses or recorded any allowance for credit losses related to our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term debt securities. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 

summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Pyramid Agreement 
 In January 2024, we acquired Pyramid Biosciences, Inc. ("Pyramid"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated January 7, 2024 (the "Pyramid Agreement"). In consideration for the Pyramid acquisition we made an upfront payment of 255,794 of our common shares. As of September 30, 2024, 253,838 of these common shares have been issued by the Company, including 428 common shares that were issued in the third quarter of 2024. We also agreed to make additional success-based payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones, which we may elect to pay in cash or our common shares. In January 2024, a payment became due to Pyramid related to achievement of a developmental milestone under the Pyramid Agreement, which we elected to pay in 98,129 of our common shares. As of September 30, 2024, 97,387 of these common shares have been issued by the Company, including 154 common shares that were issued in the third quarter of 2024.

See Item 5, Other Information for additional information related to the Knopp Amendment. 
 
 In connection with the Knopp Amendment, we issued to Knopp 1,872,874 of our common shares, valued at approximately 75.0 million as of the effective date, through a private placement within 60 days of the date of execution of the Knopp Amendment (the 2024 Additional Consideration ). We also agreed to issue additional shares of our common shares, valued at approximately 75.0 million, within 60 days of the first anniversary of execution of the Knopp Amendment (the 2025 Additional Consideration ). In addition, we issued to Knopp a warrant (the "Warrant") to purchase 294,195 of our common shares at a purchase price per share of 67.98, subject to certain specified development milestones and achieving a specified market capitalization. 
 
 The foregoing issuance and sale of our common shares in connection with the execution of the Knopp Amendment and the Warrant have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act or any state securities laws.
