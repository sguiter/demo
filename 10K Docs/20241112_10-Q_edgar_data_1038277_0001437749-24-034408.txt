The Company and DOE are currently working on an extension to this contract for future irradiation and supply of Cobalt. The DOE may end the contract if it determines termination is necessary for the national defense, security or environmental safety of the United States. 
 
 Sales of our most predominant Theranostics Products are dependent upon a few key suppliers. An interruption in production by any of these individual suppliers could have an immediate negative impact upon Theranostics Products sales until material could be purchased from alternate suppliers including obtaining regulatory approval to use material from alternative suppliers if necessary. The Company has identified additional suppliers in 2024, with anticipated regulatory approvals for those suppliers in 2025 and continue to search for additional means to produce and procure certain critical isotopes. 
 
 The Nuclear Medicine Reference and Calibration Standard products sold by the Company are dependent upon certain radioisotopes that are supplied to the Company through agreements with several suppliers. A loss of any of these suppliers could adversely affect operating results by causing a delay in production or a possible loss of sales. In nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there was a global shortage of Cobalt- 57 isotopes, a key isotope for this business segment that resulted in significant lost sales. The Company has added additional suppliers in 2024 and continue to search for additional means to produce and procure certain critical isotopes, including through our Chinese Joint Venture. In the third quarter of 2024 our main supply of Cobalt- 57 was restored. We have seen a sharp decrease in cancellations of orders, and we have been able to process through our backlogged orders. We expect increased revenue due to this backlog catch-up throughout the remainder of 2024 and potentially into the first quarter of 2025 as our global isotope supply chain has normalized. 

Contingencies 
 
 Because all the Company s business segments involve the handling or use of radioactive material, the Company is required to have an operating license from the NRC and specially trained staff to handle these materials. The Company has amended this operating license numerous times to increase the amount of material permitted within the Company s facility. Although this license does not currently restrict the volume of business operations performed or projected to be performed in the upcoming year, additional processing capabilities and license amendments could be implemented that would permit the processing of other reactor-produced radioisotopes by the Company. The financial assurance required by the NRC to support this license has been provided for with a surety bond held with North American Specialty Insurance Company which is supported by a restricted money market account held with Merrill Lynch. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company funded an additional to this restricted money market account. At September 30, 2024 , the balance of this account was . 
 
 On February 8, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our assets related to the Fluorine Products segment and the Planned Uranium De-Conversion Facility, including the Lea County land, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million, subject to conditions. The Company expects to close the agreement within 12 to 24 months of signing. Closing is contingent on various conditions being met, including approvals and agreements by the NRC and other third parties. The Company has not recorded the value of this property as an asset and will not do so until such time that material changes to or sufficient progress on the project has been made to meet the Company s obligations under the agreements for permanent transfer of the title.

The Company s revenue consists primarily of distribution of theranostics including sodium iodide I- 131 drug product, calibration and reference standards manufactured for use in the nuclear medicine industry, and cobalt source manufacturing. With the exception of certain unique products, the Company s normal operating cycle is considered to be one year. Due to the time required to produce some cobalt products, the Company s operating cycle for those products is considered to be two to three years. Accordingly, preliminary payments received on cobalt contracts where shipment has not taken place have been recorded as unearned revenue on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets and classified under current or long-term liabilities, depending upon estimated ship dates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company reported current unearned revenue of . For the period ended December 31, 2023 , the Company reported current unearned revenue of . These unearned revenues will be recognized as revenue in the periods during which the cobalt shipments take place.

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 
 International Isotopes Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including RadQual, LLC, TI Services, LLC, RadVent, LLC, and Radnostix, LLC) (collectively, the "Company", "we", "our", or "us") manufacture a full range of nuclear medicine calibration and reference standards, manufacture a range of cobalt products, and distribute sodium iodide I-131 as a generic drug. We own 100 interest of RadQual, LLC (RadQual), a global supplier of molecular imaging quality control and calibration devices. As TI Services, LLC is a 50/50 joint venture between the Company and RadQual, TI Services, LLC is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 
 Our business consists of the following five business segments: 
 
 Theranostics Products. Our Theranostics Products segment (formerly called Radiochemical Products) includes production and distribution of our FDA approved generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and carcinoma of the thyroid. This segment also includes distribution of certain other theranostic APIs, radiochemical products, and contract manufacturing of radiopharmaceutical products for our customers. Additionally, this segment includes the Theranostics Products segment of our Radnostix China Joint Venture. 
 
 Cobalt Products. Our Cobalt Products segment includes the production of bulk cobalt (cobalt-60), fabrication of cobalt capsules for radiation therapy and various industrial applications, and recycling of expended cobalt sources. We are the only company in the U.S. that can provide all these unique services. There has been a significant increase in regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in recent years that has created a significant barrier to new entrants into this market. The Company has a contract in place with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the production of high specific activity cobalt in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) in Idaho. This agreement will be in effect until October 2024. 
 
 Nuclear Medicine Standards . Our Nuclear Medicine Standards segment consists of the manufacture of sources and standards, including those associated with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. These sources are used for indication of patient positioning for SPECT imaging, SPECT camera operational testing, and calibration of dose measurement equipment. Revenue from nuclear medicine products includes consolidated sales from TI Services, LLC (TI Services), a 50/50 joint venture that we formed with RadQual in December 2010 to distribute our products, as well as sales from RadQual. Our nuclear medicine standards products include a host of specially designed items used in the nuclear medicine industry. In addition to the manufacture of these products, we have developed a complete line of specialty packaging for the safe transport and handling of these products as well as manufacturing of industrial calibration reference sources made by the Company, distribution of 3 rd Party industrial calibration reference sources, and the sale of bulk radioisotopes. 
 
 On August 6, 2024, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Phantech LLC to form PhanQual. PhanQual will leverage INIS s and Phantech s technologies, facilities, experience, and global network to design, manufacture, and distribute sealed sources, including adapting Phantech's patented and cutting-edge fillable calibration source technology, into sealed source calibration devices to better serve the R D and theranostics community. Additionally, RadQual will globally distribute Phantech s entire portfolio of fillable sources through RadQual s global network of distributors. PhanQual s revenues and operations will operate through RadQual and will be included in our Nuclear Medicine Standards segment. The Company has already begun commercial sales of PhanQual products.

Medical Devices . A new reportable business segment starting in 2024. While we have not yet commercialized any medical devices, we have invested in this segment throughout 2023 and 2024 and anticipate additional investments for the remainder of 2024 with commercialization of products starting later in 2024. In June 2023, we acquired several medical devices with related assets and intellectual property rights from AMICI, Inc. We have been working on start-up of manufacturing of the Swirler and Tru-Fit Mouthpiece assets under the branding of RadVent. Additionally, we also have investments in a joint venture arrangement for the startup of our EasyFill Automated Iodine Capsule System. We also plan to commercialize 3 rd party medical devices and accessories related to the radiopharmaceutical and theranostics spaces and provide engineering, installation, and preventative maintenance and services related to those medical devices. 
 
 Fluorine Products. We established the Fluorine Products segment in 2004 in conjunction with the development and operation of the proposed depleted uranium de-conversion facility in Lea County, New Mexico. Near the end of 2013, due to changes in the nuclear industry, we placed further engineering work for this project on hold. On February 8, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our assets related to the Fluorine Products segment and the Planned Uranium De-Conversion Facility, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 12.5 million, subject to conditions. We expect to close the agreement within 12 to 24 months of signing. Closing is contingent on various conditions being met, including approvals and agreements by the NRC and other third parties.

The decrease is due to a global shortage of Cobalt-57 isotope during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which began in January of 2024. Due to this shortage of raw material and our inability to deliver products, we experienced extraordinary rates of cancellations of orders throughout FY2024, causing a loss of revenue of more than 300,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024 our supply of Cobalt-57 was restored, we have seen a sharp decrease in cancellations as we have been able to process backlogged orders. We expect an increase in revenue as we catch up on backlogged orders throughout the remainder of 2024 and into the first quarter of 2025 as our global isotope supply chain has been normalized. 
 
 Cost of sales for our nuclear medicine standards segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 435,048, as compared to 470,130 for the same period in 2023.

Gross profit for our nuclear medicine standards segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 491,354 compared to 584,550 for the same period in 2023. This is a decrease in gross profit of 93,196, or approximately 16 . 
 
 Operating expense for this segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 451,835, from 509,834 for the same period in 2023. This is a decrease of 57,999, or approximately 11 , and is the result of the decreased sales activity in the segment. Net income for this segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 39,519, compared to a net income of 74,716 for the same period in 2023. This is a decrease in net income of 35,197 and is the result of decreased revenue. 
 
 Medical Device Products . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had no revenue for our Medical Device Products segment. 
 
 Operating expense for this segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 167,451 with no operating expenses in the same period in 2023. Expenses include costs for labor, professional services, and research and development related to the startup of this new business segment as no commercial activities have begun. 
 
 Fluorine Products . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had no revenue for our fluorine products segment. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 26,095 of expenses related to maintenance of plans, designs, and other assets for a proposed de-conversion facility, as compared to 27,870 for the same three-month period in 2023. 
 
 On February 8, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our assets related to the Fluorine Products segment and the Planned Uranium De-Conversion Facility. We expect to close the agreement within 12 to 24 months of signing. Closing is contingent on various conditions being met, including approvals and agreements by the NRC and other third parties. Upon closing of this agreement, the costs of maintenance for the assets in this segment would not continue. With no assets nor operating activities, this business segment would be phased out.

Operating expense increased approximately 8 to 6,599,765 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 6,100,809 for the same period in 2023. This increase of 498,956 is due to a 20 increase in General, Administrative, and Consulting Expenses and a 20 increase in Research and Development costs which was offset by a 3 decrease in Salaries and Contract Labor Expenses. The increase in General, Administrative, and Consulting Expenses is primarily the result of increased professional expenses for building out Medical Device segments and waste disposal expenses that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. We had one-time professional expenses of approximately 200,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to legal consulting and root cause audits for NRC enforcement and settlement for a violation that occurred in 2022, and we had 230,000 of waste disposal expenses. The increase in Research and Development cost is due to increased expenses related to product development during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Research and Development cost includes approximately 150,000 of legal fees related to one-time licensing and intellectual property expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in Salaries and Contract Labor Expenses is primarily due to decreased officer compensation.

Other income was 176,094 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 123,803 for the same period in 2023. This is an increase of 52,291, or approximately 42 , was due to an increase in miscellaneous income partially offset by 63,000 of other expense for NRC fines. We have taken extensive internal actions to mitigate the risk of any similar violations and penalties occurring again. These matters have been finalized with the NRC. 
 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 244,695, compared to 247,542 for the same period in 2023. This is a decrease of 2,847, or approximately 1 . Interest expense includes dividends accrued on our Series C Preferred Stock. As discussed below, we issued Series C Preferred Stock in February 2017 and May 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we accrued dividends payable of 151,008 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which have been recorded as interest expense. See Note 7 Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for additional information about our indebtedness and the associated interest expense. 
 
 On September 25, 2024, with the approval of a majority of holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, the mandatory redemption date of the Series C Preferred was extended for an additional two years to February 28, 2027. 
 
 Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 237,245 compared to net loss of 759,961 for the same period in 2023. This is a decrease in net loss of 522,716, or approximately 69 improvement, that is largely the result of increased revenue in our Theranostics Products and Cobalt Products segments and increased gross profit percentages partially offset by the decrease in revenue in our Nuclear Medicine Standards Products segment coupled with continued investment in the start-up of our Medical Device Products segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Theranostics Products . Revenue from the sale of theranostics products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,257,410, compared to 5,033,337 for the same period in 2023. This is an increase of 1,224,073, or approximately 24 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is the result of continued growth in sales of our generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product. We expect this sales growth to continue for our Theranostics products going forward, primarily from the sale of our generic sodium iodide I-131 drug product and new sales of theranostic API product. 
 
 Gross profit of theranostics products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,498,675, compared to 3,269,100 for the same period in 2023, an increase of 38 . Gross profit percentages were approximately 72 and 65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of sales for theranostics products decreased to 1,758,735 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,764,237 for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of increased utilization and decreased pricing for our raw material isotope. Operating expense for this segment decreased to 1,024,555 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,097,120 for the same period in 2023. This decrease in operating expense of 72,565, or approximately 7 was primarily due to decreased labor costs. This segment reported net income of 3,474,120 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 2,171,980 for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income of 1,302,140 or 60 is the result of increases in revenue, increased gross profit percentage, and decreased expenses.

Cobalt Products . Revenue from the sale of cobalt products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,641,012, compared to 935,544 for the same period in 2023. This represents an increase of 705,468, or approximately 75 . The increase was primarily due to the timing of cobalt sealed source manufacturing sales and available of cobalt-60 raw material. Large value sales of high activity cobalt sources occur at various times throughout the year. Frequently the timing of these sales can have a significant impact on period comparisons. 
 
 Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 901,546, as compared to 456,280, for the same period in 2023. Gross profit for cobalt products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 739,466 compared to 479,264 for the same period in 2023. This is an increase of 260,202 or approximately 54 and is attributable to increased revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating expense in this segment increased to 758,272 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 361,156 for the same period in 2023. This is an increase of 397,116, or approximately 110 . This increase in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of increased waste disposal costs including a 230,000 waste disposal expense that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our net loss for cobalt products was 18,806 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net income of 118,108 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income of 136,914, or approximately 116 , was attributable to a 230,000 waste disposal expense partially offset by increased revenue and gross profit. 

Nuclear Medicine Standards . Revenue from nuclear medicine products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,099,713, compared to 3,151,375 for the same period in 2023. This represents a decrease in revenue of 1,051,662, or approximately 33 . The decrease is due to a global shortage of Cobalt-57 isotope during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 beginning in January 2024. Due to this shortage of raw material and inability to deliver products, we experienced extraordinary rates of cancellations of orders throughout FY2024, causing an overall loss of revenue of more than 300,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024 our main supply of Cobalt-57 was restored. We have seen a sharp decrease in cancellations of orders, and we have been able to process through our backlogged orders. We expect increased revenue due to this backlog catch-up throughout the remainder of 2024 and potentially into the first quarter of 2025 as our global isotope supply chain has normalized. 
 
 Cost of sales for our nuclear medicine standards segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,004,804, as compared to 1,484,422 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales in the period-to-period comparison of 479,618, or 32 , was due to decreased revenue during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Gross profit for our nuclear medicine standards segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,094,909 compared to 1,666,953 for the same period in 2023 This is a decrease in gross profit of 572,044, or approximately 34 . 
 
 Operating expense for this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 1,423,652, from 1,453,724 for the same period in 2023. This is a decrease of 30,072, or approximately 2 . Net loss for this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 328,743, compared to a net income of 213,229 for the same period in 2023. This is a decrease in net income of 541,972, or approximately 254 and is the result of decreased revenue. 
 
 Medical Device Products . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had no revenue for our Medical Device Products segment as no commercial activities have begun. 
 
 Operating expense for this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 279,801 with no operating expenses in the same period in 2023. Expenses include costs for labor, professional services, and research and development related to the startup of this new business segment. 
 
 Fluorine Products . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had no operating revenue for our fluorine products segment.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received other income of 50,000 for payments related to the DUF6 Asset Sale. As compared to 7,920 of other income for the same nine-month period in 2023. 
 
 On February 8, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our assets related to the Fluorine Products segment and the Planned Uranium De-Conversion Facility. We expect to close the agreement within 12 to 24 months of signing. Closing is contingent on various conditions being met, including approvals and agreements by the NRC and other third parties. Upon closing of this agreement, the costs of maintenance for the assets in this segment would not continue. With no assets nor operating activities, this business segment would be phased out.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2,372,983 as compared to 2,688,141 at December 31, 2023. This is a decrease of 315,158 or approximately 12 .

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was a result of a one-time receipt of a tax refund receivable in 2023. 
 
 This decrease in cash and cash equivalents at period end is mainly due to a 484,000 transfer from cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash to fund an increase to our decommissioning funding plan. Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased by 218,867 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Our inventory consists of work in process material for our Theranostics Products, Cobalt Products, Nuclear Medicine Products, and Medical Device Products segments. The decrease in revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mostly due to decreased inventory of Cobalt-57 raw material and Cobalt-57 finished goods due to the global shortage of Cobalt-57. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 231,307 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and cash used in investing activities was 550,629 for the same period in 2023. The cash used in both periods was for the purchase of equipment offset by sales of equipment.

 In February 2024, we paid our annual dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock. Dividends payable totaled 243,780 at that time. Some holders of the Series C Preferred Stock elected to settle their dividend payments with shares of the Company s common stock in lieu of cash. The Company issued 1,808,400 shares of common stock in lieu of a dividend payment of 90,420. The remaining 153,360 of dividend payable was settled with cash. 
 
 On September 25, 2024, with the approval of a majority of holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, the mandatory redemption date of the Series C Preferred was extended for an additional two years to February 28, 2027. 
 
 Total increase in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 218,867 compared to a cash increase of 550,681 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 We expect that cash from operations, cash raised via equity financing, and our current cash balance will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months. Our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including commercial relationships, technological developments, market factors, available credit, and preferred stock shareholders. There is no assurance that additional capital and financing will be available on acceptable terms to the Company or at all.
