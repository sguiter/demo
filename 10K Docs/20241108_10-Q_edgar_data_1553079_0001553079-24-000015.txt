 million rentable square feet of office space, million rentable square feet of retail space and residential units. Our office portfolio included properties (including long-term ground leasehold interests). of these office properties are located in midtown Manhattan and encompass approximately million rentable square feet of office space and million rentable square feet of retail space, including the Empire State Building. The remaining office property is located in Stamford, Connecticut, with immediate access to mass transportation. Additionally, we have entitled land adjacent to the Stamford office property that can support the development of either office or residential per local zoning. Our multifamily portfolio included residential units in New York City. 
 We were organized as a Delaware limited partnership on November 28, 2011, and commenced operations upon completion of the initial public offering of ESRT s Class A common stock and related formation transactions on October 7, 2013 (the "IPO"). ESRT's Class A common stock, par value per share, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ESRT." ESRT, as the sole general partner in our Company, has responsibility and discretion in the management and control of our Company, and our limited partners, in such capacity, have no authority to transact business for, or participate in the management activities, of our Company.

We funded the buyer for these costs and we have no further obligations or contingencies related to this property. 
 
 In April 2024, we worked with the First Stamford Place mortgage lender to structure a consensual foreclosure. On May 22, 2024, a receiver was appointed and we ended our management of the property. In connection with this, we removed the related assets and liabilities from our condensed consolidated balance sheet and recognized a gain in the condensed consolidated statements of operations of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We also recorded a contract asset of million that represents the amount of obligation we expect to be released upon the final resolution of the foreclosure process on First Stamford Place. The gain recognized subsequent to the initial derecognition of the related assets and liabilities of First Stamford Place represents the additional obligation we expect to be released arising from the accrued interest expense associated with the First Stamford Place mortgage, net of certain closing costs. The related debt of million and accrued interest of million are included in debt associated with property under receivership and accrued interest associated with property under receivership, respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had goodwill of million. Goodwill was allocated million to the Observatory reportable segment and million to the real estate reportable segment. 
 We performed our annual goodwill testing in October 2023, where we bypassed the optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment and proceeded directly to a quantitative assessment of the Observatory reportable segment and engaged a third-party valuation consulting firm to perform the valuation process. The quantitative analysis used a combination of the discounted cash flow method (a form of the income approach) utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs and the guideline company method (a form of the market approach). Significant assumptions under the former included revenue and cost projections, weighted average cost of capital, long-term growth rate and income tax considerations while the latter included guideline company enterprise values, revenue multiples, EBITDA multiples and control premium rates. Our methodology to review goodwill impairment, which included a significant amount of judgment and estimates, provided a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment had occurred. The quantitative analysis performed concluded the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. We also perform quarterly qualitative assessments and have not identified any events which would indicate, on a more likely than not basis, that the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was impaired. Many of the factors employed in determining whether or not goodwill is impaired are outside of our control, and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods. We will continue to assess the impairment of the Observatory reporting unit goodwill going forward.

 Unsecured Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities 
 On March 8, 2024, through our Operating Partnership, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto, that amends and restates the amended and restated credit agreement, dated August 29, 2017 which governs our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan facility (collectively, the BofA Credit Facilities ). The BofA Credit Facilities are comprised of a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and a million term loan facility (the BofA Term Loan Facility ). We may request that the BofA Credit Facilities be increased through one or more increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or one or more increases in the BofA Term Loan Facility or the addition of new pari passu term loan tranches, for a maximum aggregate principal amount under the second amended and restated credit agreement not to exceed billion. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 8, 2029, inclusive of extension periods and replaced the existing revolving credit facility that was due to mature in March 2025. The BofA Term Loan Facility matures on March 8, 2029, inclusive of extension periods and replaced the existing term loan facility that was due to mature in March 2025. Initial interest rates on the BofA Credit Facilities, which may change based on our leverage levels, are SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment of basis points ("adjusted SOFR") plus basis points for any drawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and adjusted SOFR plus basis points for the BofA Term Loan Facility. In addition, the BofA Credit Facilities have a sustainability-linked pricing mechanism that reduces the borrowing spread if certain benchmarks are achieved each year. As of September 30, 2024 , we had million borrowings drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility and million under the BofA Term Loan Facility. 
 On March 13, 2024, through our Operating Partnership, we entered into a third amendment to our credit agreement dated March 19, 2020 with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which governs a senior unsecured term loan facility (the Wells Term Loan Facility ). The Wells Term Loan Facility is in the original principal amount of million and matures on December 31, 2026. The third amendment provides for, among other things, certain conforming changes to the BofA Credit Facilities agreement, including increases to the capitalization rate for certain of our properties. No other changes were made to the amount of the commitments, the maturity date of the outstanding loans or the covenants. We may request the Wells Term Loan Facility be increased through one or more increases or the addition of new pari passu term loan tranches, for a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed million. As of September 30, 2024 , our borrowings amounted to million under the Wells Term Loan Facility.

million principal amount of notes, consisting of (a) million aggregate principal amount of Series I Green Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 17, 2029, (b) million aggregate principal amount of Series J Green Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 17, 2031 and (c) million aggregate principal amount of Series K Green Guaranteed Senior Notes due June 17, 2034. The sale of the Series I-K notes closed on June 17, 2024. The issue price for the notes was of the aggregate principal amount thereof. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we may prepay all or a portion of the notes upon notice to the holders at a price equal to of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 
 The terms of our senior unsecured notes, including the Series I-K notes, include customary covenants, including limitations on liens, investment, distributions, debt, fundamental changes, and transactions with affiliates and require certain customary financial reports. The terms also require compliance with financial ratios including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, and a maximum unsecured leverage ratio. The agreements also contain customary events of default (subject in certain cases to specified cure periods), including but not limited to non-payment, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or other insolvency events, judgments, ERISA events, the occurrence of certain change of control transactions and loss of REIT qualification. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants.

As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our derivative instruments amounted to million which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets, and million which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. These interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and hedge the variability in future cash flows associated with our existing variable-rate term loan facilities. Interest rate caps not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, our cash flow hedges are deemed highly effective and a net unrealized loss of ) million and ) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a net unrealized gain of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, relating to both active and terminated hedges of interest rate risk, are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the debt. We estimate that million net gain of the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into interest expense within the next 12 months.

 years. Certain leases have termination options for a fee and/or renewal options. The leases provide for base monthly rentals and reimbursements for real estate taxes, escalations linked to the consumer price index or common area maintenance known as operating expense escalation. Operating expense reimbursements are reflected in our September 30, 2024 and 2023 condensed consolidated statements of operations as rental revenue. 
 Rental revenue includes fixed and variable payments. Fixed payments primarily relate to base rent and variable payments primarily relate to tenant expense reimbursements for certain property operating costs.

ground lease assets and are reflected in right-of-use assets of million and lease liabilities of million in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. 
 The ground leases are due to expire between the years 2050 and 2077, inclusive of extension options, and have no variable payments or residual value guarantees. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we determined our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the date of adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), in determining the present value of lease payments. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate used to calculate the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was . Rent expense for lease payments related to our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases. The weighted average remaining lease term as of September 30, 2024 was years.

 former investors (the "Claimants") in Empire State Building Associates L.L.C. ESBA ), which, prior to the IPO, owned the fee title to the Empire State Building, filed an arbitration with the American Arbitration Association against Peter L. Malkin, Anthony E. Malkin, Thomas N. Keltner, Jr., and our subsidiary ESRT MH Holdings LLC, the former supervisor of ESBA, (the "Respondent s "). The statement of claim (also filed later in federal court in New York for the expressed purpose of tolling the statute of limitations) alleged breach of fiduciary duty and related claims in connection with the IPO and formation transactions and sought monetary damages and declaratory relief. Claimants had opted out of a prior class action bringing similar claims that were settled with court approval. Respondents filed an answer and counterclaims. In March 2015, the federal court action was stayed on consent of all parties pending the arbitration. Arbitration hearings started in May 2016 and concluded in August 2018. On August 26, 2020, the arbitration panel issued an award that denied all Claimants claims with one exception, on which it awarded the Claimants approximately million, inclusive of of interest through October 2, 2020. This amount was recorded as an IPO litigation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.

million, inclusive of interest. The Respondents believe those rulings are incorrect and have appealed them. In addition, certain of the Claimants in the federal court action brought to toll the statute of limitations and sought to pursue claims in that case against the Respondents. Respondents believe that any such claims are meritless. The magistrate judge assigned to the action has issued a Report and Recommendation rejecting the Claimants claims; the district judge will decide whether to adopt the Report and Recommendation. 
 Pursuant to indemnification agreements which were made with our directors, executive officers and chairman emeritus as part of our formation transactions, Anthony E. Malkin, Peter L. Malkin and Thomas N. Keltner, Jr. have defense and indemnity rights from us with respect to this arbitration. 
 Unfunded Capital Expenditures 
 At September 30, 2024, we estimate that we will incur approximately million of capital expenditures (including tenant improvements and leasing commissions) on our properties pursuant to existing lease agreements. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with operating cash flow, cash on hand and other borrowings. Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs. We expect that these financing requirements will be met in a similar fashion. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that subject us to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, tenant and other receivables and deferred rent receivables. At September 30, 2024, we held on deposit at various major financial institutions cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 We are required to accrue costs that we are legally obligated to incur on retirement of our properties which result from acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation of such properties. Retirement includes sale, abandonment or disposal of a property. Under that standard, a conditional asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within a company s control and a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation must be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Environmental site assessments and investigations have identified asbestos or asbestos-containing building materials in certain of our properties. As of September 30, 2024, management has no plans to remove or alter these properties in a manner that would trigger federal and other applicable regulations for asbestos removal, and accordingly, the obligations to remove the asbestos or asbestos-containing building materials from these properties have indeterminable settlement dates. As such, we are unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of the associated conditional asset retirement obligation. However ongoing asbestos abatement, maintenance programs and other required documentation are carried out as required and related costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Other Environmental Matters 
 Under various federal, state and/or local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation or remediation, natural resource damages, or third-party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several. Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property or adjacent properties for commercial, industrial or other purposes. Such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities when we arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, regardless of whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination on our properties may adversely affect our ability to attract and/or retain tenants, and our ability to develop or sell or borrow against those properties. In addition to potential liability for cleanup costs, private plaintiffs may bring claims for personal injury, property damage or for similar reasons. Environmental laws also

The other non-controlling interest in the OP is diversified among various limited partners, some of whom include Company directors, senior management and employees. ESRT has classes of common stock as a means to give its OP Unit holders voting rights in the public company that correspond to their economic interest in the combined entity. A one-time option was created at our formation transactions for any pre-IPO OP Unit holder to exchange one OP Unit out of every 50 OP Units they owned for one ESRT Class B share, and such ESRT Class B share carries votes per share. 
 Stock and Publicly Traded Operating Partnership Unit Repurchase Program 
 ESRT's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of ESRT Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2025. Under the program, ESRT may purchase ESRT Class A common stock and we may purchase our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by ESRT and us at our discretion and will be subject to stock price, availability, trading volume, general market conditions, and applicable securities laws. The authorization does not obligate ESRT or us to acquire any particular amount of securities, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at ESRT's and our discretion without prior notice. As of September 30, 2024, we had million remaining of the authorized repurchase amount. There were repurchases of equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Private Perpetual Preferred Units 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were Series 2019 Preferred Units ("Series 2019 Preferred Units") and Series 2014 Private Perpetual Preferred Units ("Series 2014 Preferred Units") outstanding. The Series 2019 Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of per unit and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of per unit payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The Series 2014 Preferred Units which have a liquidation preference of per unit and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential annual cash distributions of per unit payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. Both series are not redeemable at the option of the holders and are redeemable at our option only in the case of specific defined events.

million shares of ESRT common stock was authorized for issuance under awards granted pursuant to the 2024 Plan, and as of September 30, 2024 , million shares of common stock remain available for future issuance. 
 Long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") units are a special class of partnership interests. Each LTIP unit awarded will be deemed equivalent to an award of share of ESRT stock under the Plans, reducing the availability for other equity awards on a -for-one basis. The vesting period for LTIP units, if any, will be determined at the time of issuance. Under the terms of the LTIP units, we will revalue for tax purposes its assets upon the occurrence of certain specified events, and any increase in valuation from the time of one such event to the next such event will be allocated first to the holders of LTIP units to equalize the capital accounts of such holders with the capital accounts of unitholders. Subject to any agreed upon exceptions, once vested and having achieved parity with unitholders, LTIP units are convertible into Series PR operating partnership units on a -for-one basis. 
 LTIP units subject to time-based vesting, whether vested or not, receive the same per unit distributions as operating partnership units, which equal per share dividends (both regular and special) on our common stock. Market and performance-based LTIPs receive of such distributions currently, unless and until such LTIP units are earned based on performance, at which time they will receive the accrued and unpaid and will commence receiving of such distributions thereafter. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we did t make any grants of LTIP units to employees or non-employee directors that are subject to performance-based vesting or time-based vesting. 
 Share-based compensation for time-based equity awards is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the shorter of (i) the stated vesting period, which is generally three , four or , or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible, which may occur upon grant. An employee is retirement eligible when the employee attains the (i) age of for awards granted in 2020 and after and age of for awards granted before 2020 and (ii) the date on which the employee has first completed the requisite years of continuous service with us or our affiliates. Share-based compensation for market-based equity awards and performance-based equity awards is measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over three or . Additionally, for the performance-based equity awards, we assess, at each reporting period, whether it is probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. We recognize expense respective to the number of awards we expect to vest at the conclusion of the measurement period. Changes in estimate are accounted for in the period of change through a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Any forfeitures of share-based compensation awards are recognized as they occur. 
 For the market-based LTIP units, the fair value of the awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model and discounted for the restriction period during which the LTIP units cannot be redeemed or transferred and the uncertainty regarding if, and when, the book capital account of the LTIP units will equal that of the common units. Our stock price, along with the prices of the comparative indexes, is assumed to follow the Geometric Brownian Motion Process. Geometric Brownian Motion is a common assumption when modeling in financial markets, as it allows the modeled quantity (in this case the stock price) to vary randomly from its current value and take any value greater than zero. The volatilities of the returns on our stock price and the comparative indexes were estimated based on implied volatilities and historical volatilities using an appropriate look-back period. The expected growth rate of the stock prices over the performance period is determined with consideration of the risk-free rate as of the grant date. For LTIP unit awards that are time or performance based, the fair value of the awards was 
 23 

million. The weighted average per unit or share fair value was for grants issued for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value per unit or share granted in 2024 was estimated on the respective dates of grant using the following assumptions: an expected life from to years, a dividend rate of , a risk-free interest rate from to , and an expected price volatility from to . No other stock options, dividend equivalents, or stock appreciation rights were issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Vested ) ) ) ) Granted Forfeited or unearned ) ) ) Unvested balance at September 30, 2024 
 The time-based LTIPs and ESRT restricted stock awards are treated for accounting purposes as immediately vested upon the later of (i) the date the grantee attains the age of or , as applicable, and (ii) the date on which grantee has first completed the requisite years of continuous service with our Company or its affiliates. For award agreements that qualify, we recognize noncash compensation expense on the grant date for the time-based awards and ratably over the vesting period for the market-based and performance-based awards, and accordingly, we recognized million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense was million at September 30, 2024, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 For the remainder of the LTIP unit and ESRT restricted stock awards, we recognized noncash compensation expense ratably over the vesting period, and accordingly, we recognized noncash compensation expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense was million at September 30, 2024, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 Earnings Per Unit 
 Earnings per unit is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common unitholders by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the respective period. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, whether paid or unpaid, are accounted for as participating securities. Share-based payment awards are included in the calculation of diluted income using the treasury stock method if dilutive.

Real Estate Segment 
 Rental Revenue 
 The increase in rental revenue was primarily attributable to higher occupancy and higher operating and real estate tax expense escalations driving a 7.7 million increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions made during the comparative period, which reduced rental revenue by 6.0 million. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 The increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher utilities costs and higher payroll costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher audit related costs and recognition of non-cash stock-based compensation expense of awards granted to executives that are nearing retirement eligibility during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Income 
 The increase in interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects larger cash balances compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the new senior unsecured notes issuance in April 2024. 
 Gain on Disposition of Property 
 The gain on disposition activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the additional obligation we expect to be released arising from the accrued interest expense associated with the First Stamford Place mortgage, net of certain closing costs. 
 Observatory Segment 
 Observatory Revenue 
 Observatory revenues were higher driven by increased ticket prices during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023

 Real Estate Segment 
 Rental Revenue 
 The increase in rental revenue was primarily attributable to higher occupancy and higher operating and real estate tax expense escalations driving a 23.0 million increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions made during the comparative period, which reduced rental revenue by 9.7 million. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 The increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to higher utilities and cleaning costs, higher payroll costs and higher repair and maintenance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher audit related costs and recognition of non-cash stock-based compensation expense of awards granted to executives that are nearing retirement eligibility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Income 
 The increase in interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects higher interest rates and larger cash balances compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the new senior unsecured notes issuance in April 2024. 
 Gain on Disposition of Property 
 The gain on disposition activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to the disposition of First Stamford Place in Stamford, Connecticut in May 2024. The gain on disposition activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the disposition of 500 Mamaroneck Avenue in Harrison, New York in April 2023 and 69-97 and 103-107 Main Street in Westport, Connecticut in February 2023. 
 33 

Observatory Segment 
 Observatory Revenue 
 Observatory revenues were higher driven by increased visitation and ticket prices during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, including lease-up costs, fund our redevelopment and repositioning programs, acquire properties, make distributions to our securityholders and fulfill other general business needs. Based on the historical experience of our management and our business strategy, in the foreseeable future we anticipate we will generate positive cash flows from operations. In order for ESRT to qualify as a REIT, ESRT is required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to distribute to its stockholders, on an annual basis, at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We expect to make quarterly distributions, as required, to our securityholders. 
 While we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may be required to comply with new laws or regulations that cause us to incur unanticipated capital expenditures for our properties, thereby increasing our liquidity needs. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities, debt issuances and unused borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, operating expenses, working capital, debt service, and capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt issuances, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility. The availability of these borrowings is subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable loan agreements. We expect to meet our long-term capital requirements, including acquisitions, redevelopments and capital expenditures through our cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our unsecured revolving credit facility, mortgage financings, debt issuances, common and/or preferred equity issuances and asset sales. Our properties require periodic investments of capital for individual lease related tenant improvement allowances, general capital improvements and costs associated with capital expenditures. Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. ESRT's charter does not restrict the amount of leverage that we may use. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 421.9 million available in cash and cash equivalents, and 500.0 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.3 billion of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.27 and a weighted average maturity of 5.3 years. 
 Portfolio Transaction Activity 
 On February 1, 2023, we closed on the sale of 69-97 and 103-107 Main Street in Westport, Connecticut at a gross asset valuation of 40.0 million. 
 On April 5, 2023, we closed on the sale of 500 Mamaroneck Avenue in Harrison, New York at a gross asset valuation of 53.0 million. 
 On September 14, 2023, we closed on the acquisition of a Williamsburg retail property located on the corner of North 6 th Street and Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, for a purchase price of 26.4 million. 
 On March 28, 2024, we executed a buyout of the 10 non-controlling interest in two of our multifamily properties located at 561 10 th Avenue and 345 East 94 th Street in Manhattan for 14.2 million in cash and the assumption of 18.0 million of in-place debt and now own 100 of the ownership interests in these assets. 
 On September 25, 2024, we closed on the acquisition of a portfolio of retail properties on North 6 th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for a purchase price of 143.0 million. Subsequent to quarter-end, in October 2024, we closed on the acquisition of additional retail properties on North 6 th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for approximately 52.0 million. 
 In September 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional retail asset on North 6 th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for approximately 30.0 million. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to close in mid-2025.

Unsecured Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facilities 
 In March 2024, we closed on the BofA Credit Facilities, a 715 million, five-year unsecured credit agreement which consists of the 620.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and the 95.0 million BofA Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 8, 2029, inclusive of two six-month extension periods and replaced the existing revolving credit facility that was due to mature in March 2025. The BofA Term Loan Facility matures on March 8, 2029, inclusive of two twelve-month extension periods and replaced the existing term loan facility that was due to mature in March 2025. Initial interest rates on the BofA Credit Facilities, which may change based on our leverage levels, are adjusted SOFR plus 130 basis points for any drawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and adjusted SOFR plus 150 basis points for the BofA Term Loan Facility. In addition, the BofA Credit Facilities have a sustainability-linked pricing mechanism that reduces the borrowing spread if certain benchmarks are achieved each year. See "Financial Statements - Note 5 Debt" for a summary of our unsecured revolving credit and term loan facilities. 
 Financial Covenants 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the following financial covenants: 
 Financial Covenant Required September 30, 2024 In Compliance Maximum total leverage 1.50x 2.9x Yes Minimum unencumbered interest coverage > 1.75x 4.7x Yes Maximum unsecured leverage 

 Leverage Policies 
 We expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by ESRT's Board of Directors. Although ESRT's Board of Directors has not adopted a policy that limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we anticipate that ESRT's Board of Directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or floating rate. ESRT's charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur nor do they restrict the form in which our indebtedness will be taken (including, but not limited to, recourse or non-recourse debt and cross-collateralized debt). Our overall leverage will depend on our mix of investments and the cost of leverage. ESRT's Board of Directors may from time to time modify our leverage policies in light of the then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general market conditions for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of ESRT's common stock and our traded OP units, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors.

 36 

Capital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. We intend to fund capital improvements through a combination of operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Distribution Policy 
 We intend to distribute our net taxable income to our securityholders in a manner intended to satisfy REIT distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income tax liability. 
 Before we pay any distribution, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and obligations to make payments of principal and interest, if any. However, under some circumstances, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur debt or liquidate assets at rates or times that we regard as unfavorable or make a taxable distribution of our shares in order to satisfy REIT distribution requirements. 
 Distribution to Equity Holders 
 Distributions and dividends amounting to 31.8 million and 30.8 million have been made to equity holders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Stock and Publicly Traded Operating Partnership Unit Repurchase Program 
 ESRT's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500.0 million of ESRT Class A common stock and our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2025. Under the program, ESRT may purchase ESRT Class A common stock and we may purchase our Series ES, Series 250 and Series 60 operating partnership units in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by ESRT and us at our discretion and will be subject to stock price, availability, trading volume, general market conditions, and applicable securities laws. The authorization does not obligate ESRT or us to acquire any particular amount of securities, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at ESRT's and our discretion without prior notice. As of September 30, 2024, we had 500.0 million remaining of the authorized repurchase amount. There were no repurchases of equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See "Financial Statements - Note 10. Capital." 
 Cash Flows 
 Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net cash . Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 469.9 million and 421.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase was primarily the result of the following changes in cash flows: 
 
 Operating activities . Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 14.8 million to 210.9 million primarily due to an increase in revenue including decreases in rent concessions and increase in lease termination fees. These increases are partially offset by decreases in working capital, particularly a reduction in security deposits as more tenants replaced cash deposits with letters of credit in the current period, as well as the derecognition of First Stamford Place in May 2024. 
 Investing activities . Net cash used in investing activities increased by 279.1 million to 318.5 million primarily due to the 143.4 million acquisition of a portfolio of retail properties on North 6 th Street in Williamsburg in September 2024, compared to the 26.9 million acquisition of retail properties on North 6 th Street in Williamsburg in September 2023. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 there were no proceeds from dispositions of properties compared to 88.9 million of proceeds on dispositions received in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (see "Financial Statements - Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions"). Net cash used in investing activities also increased due to a 42.5 million increase in capital expenditures and redevelopment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing activities . Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 221.0 million to 170.6 million primarily due to proceeds from a private placement of senior unsecured notes in the current period. See "Financial Statements - Note 5. Debt." 
 Net Operating Income 
 Net operating income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by: (i) the cost of funds of the property owner, (ii) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (iii) acquisition expenses, loss on 
 37 

early extinguishment of debt, impairment charges and loss from derivative financial instruments, or (iv) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from NOI because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our office or retail properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly-timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful to investors because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness. 
 NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly titled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of our net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NOI:

 Funds from Operations ("FFO") 
 We present below a discussion of FFO. We compute FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-off of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments, gains or losses 
 38 

from debt restructurings and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), less distributions to non-controlling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that we believe, when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors in understanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. In addition, we believe FFO is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate has generally appreciated over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income, when trying to understand an equity REIT s operating performance. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results of operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of performance is limited. There can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, as the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of FFO may vary from one company to another. 
 Modified Funds From Operations ("Modified FFO") 
 Modified FFO adds back an adjustment for any above or below-market ground lease amortization to traditionally defined FFO. We believe this a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance due to the non-cash accounting treatment under GAAP, which stems from the third quarter 2014 acquisition of two option properties following our formation transactions as they carry significantly below market ground leases, the amortization of which is material to our overall results. We present Modified FFO because we believe it is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it adds back the non-cash amortization of below-market ground leases. There can be no assurance that Modified FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Modified FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Modified FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. 
 Core Funds From Operations 
 Core FFO adds back to Modified FFO the following items: Interest expense associated with property in receivership and loss on early extinguishment of debt. The Company believes Core FFO is an important supplemental measure of its operating performance because it excludes non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that Core FFO presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Core FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of our net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to FFO, Modified FFO and Core FFO:

 Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations 
 Leasing 
 Due to the relatively small number of leases that are signed in any particular quarter, one or more larger leases may have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on average rent, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs for that period. As a result, we believe it is more appropriate when analyzing trends in average rent and tenant improvement and leasing commission costs to review activity over multiple quarters or years. Tenant improvement costs include expenditures for general improvements occurring concurrently with, but that are not directly related to, the cost of installing a new tenant. Leasing commission costs are similarly subject to significant fluctuations depending upon the length of leases being signed and the mix of tenants from quarter to quarter. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately 0.6 million rentable square feet of space in our portfolio available to lease (excluding leases signed but not yet commenced) representing 7.0 of the net rentable square footage of the properties in our commercial portfolio. In addition, leases representing 2.6 and 6.3 of net rentable square footage of the properties in our commercial portfolio will expire in 2024 and in 2025, respectively. These leases are expected to represent approximately 2.3 and 6.9 , respectively, of our annualized rent for such periods. Our revenues and results of operations can be impacted by expiring leases that are not renewed or re-leased or that are renewed or re-leased at base rental rates equal to, above or below the current average base rental rates. Further, our revenues and results of operations can also be affected by downtime after space is vacated and the costs we incur to re-lease available space, including payment of leasing commissions, redevelopments and build-to-suit remodeling that may not be borne by the tenant. 
 Observatory Operations 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Observatory hosted 1,860,000 visitors, compared to 1,852,000 visitors for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.4 . Observatory revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 98.1 million, a 5 increase from 93.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Observatory revenue increase was driven by higher visitation levels and ticket prices in 2024. 
 Observatory revenues and admissions are dependent upon the following: (i) the number of tourists (domestic and international) who come to New York City and visit the Observatory, as well as any related tourism trends; (ii) the prices per admission that can be charged; (iii) seasonal trends affecting the number of visitors to the Observatory; (iv) competition, in particular from other new and existing observatories; and (v) weather trends. 
 Outlook 
 Year to date in 2024, ESRT has benefited from solid leasing activity and Observatory performance. 
 We believe the global economy, including the real estate sector, currently navigates an environment of uncertainty around inflation, higher interest rates, reduced availability of commercial real estate loans, questions on the direction of capital markets, risk of recession and 
 40 

geopolitical unrest. In particular, there have been concerns about the softening of the office real estate market in particular, amidst refinancing challenges of existing low interest rate loans and associated reduced new loan availability and increased costs of loans and related increased expectations of equity returns, coupled with the gradual pace of return-to-office and its impact on the physical utilization of space and asset valuations. Additionally, the risk of a global economic recession could impact the number of visitors to the Empire State Building Observatory, as well as our pricing power. 
 Despite this global economic backdrop, we believe that ESRT is in a good competitive position with diversified drivers of income across office, retail, multifamily and the Empire State Building Observatory. ESRT s New York City-focused portfolio is modernized, amenitized, well-located and energy efficient, with indoor environmental quality, competitive rental rates and strong leased percentages. We believe our business is further fortified by the continued performance of our Observatory attraction. 
 In addition to our diversified portfolio, our business is supported by a well-positioned balance sheet, modest leverage and good access to liquidity as set forth herein. The absence of unaddressed near term debt maturities provides an added degree of security in a rising rate environment. This provides us optionality to execute on capital recycling, acquisitions, and buybacks. As we navigate these uncertain times, we remain prepared for various challenges and situations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily on our unsecured revolving credit facility and debt refinancings. In order to mitigate our interest rate risk, we may borrow at fixed rates or may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps on floating rate financial instruments. We are not subject to foreign currency risk and we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have interest rate SOFR swap and cap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 680.4 million and which mature between October 1, 2024 and November 1, 2033. The "variable to fixed" interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective with fair values in an asset position of 5.7 million and are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and the fair value of our derivative instruments in a liability position amounted to 2.1 million that is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on the 2.3 billion of fixed-rate indebtedness outstanding was 4.27 per annum, with maturities at various dates through March 17, 2035. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our outstanding debt was approximately 2.2 billion, which was approximately 117.7 million less than the book value as of such date. Interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and ESRT's Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, ESRT's Chief Executive Officer and ESRT's Chief Financial Officer concluded, as of that time, that our disclosure controls were not effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of September 30, 2024 because of a material weakness identified in the design of certain information technology ("IT") general controls ("ITGCs"). 
 A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously reported in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, our Form 10-Q/A for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, and our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, we identified a material weakness in the design of ITGCs related to IT systems and applications relevant to preparation of our financial statements. In particular, the Company's ITGCs included: (i) controls to approve and monitor changes within information systems and related applications, but the monitoring controls were not designed to ensure a complete population of changes were subject to the control procedures across all relevant IT components and (ii) the controls to approve and monitor user access to information systems and related applications, but the monitoring controls were not designed to review the appropriateness of permissions granted to approved users. As a result, business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the ineffective ITGCs, or that rely on data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs, were also deemed ineffective. 
 42 

Despite the finding of the material weakness, management has concluded that our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included herein fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented. 
 Remediation of the Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company is in the process of implementing changes associated with the design, implementation and monitoring of ITGCs in the areas of logical access and change management for IT applications that support the Company s financial statement preparation and reporting processes to ensure that internal controls are designed and operating effectively. Our remediation plans are expected to include: 
 Enhancing the current change monitoring control to use an appropriate system source to help ensure a complete population of changes are reviewed to detect if any changes were made outside the Company s established change control process across all relevant IT components. 
 Adding controls to manage the appropriate assignment and maintenance of permission configurations within access groups and the users they are assigned to. 
 Increasing the frequency of periodic re-evaluation of user access privileges. 
 Training relevant personnel on the design and operation of our ITGCs over financial reporting. 
 We believe that these actions, collectively, will remediate the material weakness identified. However, we will not be able to conclude that we have completely remediated the material weakness until the applicable controls are fully implemented and have operated for a sufficient period of time and management concludes, through formal testing, that the remediated controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures, and controls and will make any further changes management deems appropriate. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the continuing remediation of the material weaknesses noted above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that were identified in connection with the evaluation referenced above that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
