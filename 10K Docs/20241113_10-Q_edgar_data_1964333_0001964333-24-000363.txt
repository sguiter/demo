 The Company is required to conduct an impairment evaluation on AFS securities to determine whether the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery. If these situations apply, the guidance requires the Company to reduce the security's amortized cost basis down to its fair value through earnings. The Company also evaluates the unrealized losses on AFS securities to determine if a security's decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis is due to credit factors. The evaluation is based upon factors such as the creditworthiness of the underlying borrowers, performance of the underlying collateral, if applicable, and the level of credit support in the security structure. Management also evaluates other factors and circumstances that may be indicative of a decline in the fair value of the security due to a credit factor. 
 This includes, but is not limited to, an evaluation of the type of security, length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, and near-term prospects of the issuer. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of the expected cash flows of the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost, an allowance for credit losses ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis under the current expected credit loss CECL standard, and declines due to non-credit factors are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ), net of taxes. If a credit loss is recognized in earnings, subsequent improvements to the expectation of collectability will be recognized through the ACL. If the fair value of the security increases above its amortized cost, the unrealized gain will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Prior to implementation of the CECL standard, unrealized losses caused by a credit event would require the direct write-down of the AFS security through the other-than-temporary impairment approach. 
 The Company did t record an ACL on the AFS securities as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023. The Company considers the unrealized losses on the AFS securities to be related to fluctuations in market conditions, primarily interest rates, and not reflective of deterioration in credit. The Company had securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024. The Company has evaluated AFS securities in an unrealized loss position for credit-related impairment at September 30, 2024, and concluded no impairment existed based on a combination of factors, which included: (1) the securities are of high credit quality, (2) unrealized losses are primarily the result of market volatility and increases in market interest rates, (3) the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer(s) to settle the securities at a price less than the par value of each investment, (4) issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and (5) the Company does not intend to sell any of the investments and the accounting standard of more likely than not has not been met for the Company to be required to sell any of the investments before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As such, there was ACL on AFS securities at September 30, 2024. 
 Securities of U.S. Treasury and Federal Agencies and Federal Agency Mortgage (Residential and Commercial) Backed Securities 
 At September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with U.S. Treasuries and Government Agency securities, Residential Mortgage Backed Agency securities, and Commercial Mortgage Backed Agency securities were generally driven by changes in interest rates and not due to credit losses given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 Note 2 Securities (continued) 

 State and Municipal securities were primarily caused by changes in interest rates and not the credit quality of the securities. These securities are investment grade and were generally underwritten in accordance with our own investment standards prior to the decision to purchase, without relying on a bond insurer s guarantee in making the investment decision. These securities will continue to be monitored as part of our ongoing impairment analysis but are expected to perform, even if the rating agencies reduce the credit rating of the bond insurers. As a result, we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the unrealized losses for these securities do not require an ACL at September 30, 2024. 
 Residential Commercial Mortgage Backed Non-Agency Securities 
 At September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with Residential Mortgage Backed Non-Agency securities and Commercial Mortgage Backed Non-Agency securities were generally driven by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and projected collateral losses. We assess for credit impairment by estimating the present value of expected cash flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash flows include default rates, loss severities, and/or prepayment rates. Based on our assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit enhancement level of the securities, we expect to recover the entire amortized cost of these securities. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the unrealized losses for these securities do not require an ACL at September 30, 2024. 
 Asset-Backed Securities 
 At September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with Asset-Backed securities were generally driven by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and projected collateral losses. We assess for credit impairment by estimating the present value of expected cash flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash flows include default rates, loss severities, and/or prepayment rates. Based on our assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit enhancement level of the securities, we expect to recover the entire amortized cost of these securities. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the unrealized losses for these securities do not require an ACL at September 30, 2024. 
 Other Securities 
 At September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with securities were primarily driven by interest rates and not the credit quality of the securities. These investments were underwritten in accordance with our own investment standards prior to the decision to purchase, without relying on a bond insurer s guarantee in making the investment decision. Based on our assessment of the expected credit losses, we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the unrealized losses for these securities do not require an ACL at September 30, 2024. 
 Restricted stock, at cost 
 The Company s investment in Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB stock totaled million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. FHLB stock is generally viewed as a long-term investment and as a restricted investment security, which is carried at cost, because there is no market for the stock other than the FHLB or member institutions. Therefore, when evaluating FHLB stock for impairment, its value is based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The Company does not consider this investment to be impaired at September 30, 2024, and no impairment has been recognized. FHLB stock is included in a separate line item, Restricted stock, at cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not part of the Company s AFS securities portfolio. The Company s Restricted stock line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets also includes an investment in Community Bankers Bank, totaling thousand at September 30, 2024, and thousand at December 31, 2023, which is carried at cost and is not impaired at September 30, 2024.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, current economic information, and other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans by credit risk. The Company internally grades all commercial loans at the time of origination. In addition, the Company performs an annual review on the top twenty-five non-homogenous commercial loan relationships as measured by total Company exposure to each borrower. The Company uses the following definitions for credit risk classifications: 
 Pass : These include satisfactory loans that have acceptable levels of risk. 
 Special Mention : Loans classified as special mention have a potential credit weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
 Substandard : Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by sound net worth, payment capacity of the borrower, or of the collateral pledged. If weaknesses go uncorrected, there is potential for partial loss of principal and/or interest. 
 Doubtful : Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and unlikely. 
 Loss : Loans classified as a loss are considered to be uncollectible and cannot be justified to continue as viable assets. While there may be the possibility of some recovery in the future, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these loans at the present time.

 Loan Modifications 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on a modified retrospective basis. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the troubled debt restructuring TDR accounting model and requires that the Company evaluate, based on the accounting for loan modifications, whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and the modification results in a more-than-insignificant direct change in the contractual cash flows and represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. This change required all loan modifications to be accounted for under the general loan modification guidance in ASC 310-20, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, and subjects entities to new disclosure requirements on loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 
 The Company may modify loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, interest rate reduction, or an other-than-insignificant payment delay. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged off against the ACL. The Company may also provide multiple types of modifications on

 Commitments to extend credit and commercial letters of credit both include exposure to some credit loss in the event of non-performance of the customer. The Company s credit policies and procedures for credit commitments and financial guarantees are the same as those for extensions of credit that are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Many of these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and many of them will expire without being drawn upon; accordingly, they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the Company.

 2019 Stock Incentive Plan 
 In 2019, the Company s Stock Incentive Plan 2019 SIP was approved by the Bank s Board of Directors. The 2019 SIP provides for the issuance of share-based awards to directors and employees of the Company. The 2019 SIP authorized units to be issued, and the Company s practice is using authorized unissued shares to satisfy these share-based awards. Each unit represents a contingent right to receive common share or an equivalent amount of cash, or a combination of the two, at the discretion of the Company. Currently, we have a sufficient number of authorized unissued shares to satisfy all outstanding equity awards. 
 Under the 2019 SIP, the Company has issued restricted stock unit RSU awards that are both time-based and performance-based. Each RSU award will indicate the number of shares, the conditions (e.g., service, performance, and/or a combination), and the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the award at grant date. 
 2023 Stock Incentive Plan 
 In 2023, a new stock incentive plan 2023 SIP was approved by the Company s Board of Directors and shareholders. Upon the 2023 SIP s shareholder approval date of March 30, 2023, no further share-based awards will be issued under the 2019 SIP. The 2023 SIP provides for the issuance of share-based awards to directors and employees of the Company. The 2023 SIP authorized the issuance of shares, subject to an annual increase in available shares. 
 A total of and shares were issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 For time-based RSUs, the fair value was determined by using the closing stock price on the date prior to the grant date. These RSUs vest over three to . 
 The Board, from time to time, approves performance-based RSU awards that may be earned between a three to performance period. Whether or not units are earned at the end of the performance period will be determined based on the achievement of performance and/or market targets (e.g., market capitalization target) over the performance period. If the conditions are achieved, the grant recipient will receive of the units granted as these awards do not provide for a multiplier effect. The performance/market targets are determined by the Board of Directors. 
 
 The fair value for performance-based RSU awards was determined by using a Monte Carlo simulation analysis to estimate the achievement of the market capitalization target determined by the Board of Directors. The Monte Carlo simulation analysis required the following inputs: (1) expected term, (2) expected volatility, (3) risk-free rate, and (4) dividend yield. The expected term was based on the stated performance period. Management used the expected volatility from a peer group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve over the performance period. The dividend yield assumption was based on historical and anticipated dividend payouts.

Whole shares are sold to participants in the 2023 ESPP at of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of each semi-annual offering period. The first semi-annual offering period began on September 1, 2023, and the current semi-annual offering period began on September 1, 2024.

As part of the Merger, a significant portion of SAR awards accelerated their vesting and thus did not require any future service component. Management used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to fair value these accelerated SAR awards and included this value as part of the purchase price consideration discussed in Note 16 - Business Combination . 
 The Company also used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to fair value the non-accelerated SAR awards that were not fully vested.

A portion of these Merger-related costs is captured in Other Operating Non-Interest Expense as further description in Note 13 - Other Operating Expense and an additional million of such Merger-related costs is captured in Salaries and Wages, Pensions and Other Employee Benefits, Occupancy, and Equipment rentals, depreciation and maintenance. These costs captured in those line items represent change-in-control payments, acceleration of benefit due to the change-in-control, software breakage, and other lease breakage fees. The fair value of the common shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Summit was determined in the basis of the closing price of the Company s common shares on the date of completion of the Merger. 
 
 We accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Summit were recorded at their respective fair values on the date of completion of the Merger. The fair values of assets and liabilities are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information relative to the acquisition date fair values becomes available. We recognized preliminary goodwill of million in connection with the acquisition, which is not amortized for financial reporting purposes, but is subject to annual impairment testing. The goodwill arising from the transaction is t deductible for tax purposes and consisted largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the operations of the companies. 
 
 The core deposit intangible represents the value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in this transaction and will be amortized over an estimated weighted average life of years using an accelerated method which approximates the estimated run-off of the acquired deposits. The fair value of intangible assets related to core deposits was million on the date of acquisition. 
 
 The fair value of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration was million on the date of the acquisition. The gross contractual amounts receivable relating to the purchased financial assets with credit deterioration was million. The Company estimates, on the date of the acquisition, that million of the contractual cash flows specific to the purchased financial assets with credit deterioration will not be collected.

 Overview 
 Burke Herbert Financial Services Corp. was organized as a Virginia corporation on September 14, 2022, to serve as the holding company for the Bank. Burke Herbert commenced operations as a bank holding company on October 1, 2022, following a reorganization transaction in which it became the Bank s holding company. This transaction was treated as an internal reorganization as all shareholders of the Bank became shareholders of Burke Herbert. In September 2023, Burke 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Herbert elected financial holding company status. As a financial holding company, Burke Herbert is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. Burke Herbert has no material operations and owns 100 of the Bank. The Bank is a Virginia chartered commercial bank that commenced operations in 1852. The Bank is supervised and regulated by the FDIC and the Virginia BFI. 
 The Bank s primary market area includes northern Virginia and West Virginia, and it has over 75 branches and commercial loan offices across Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. The Company s branch locations accept business and consumer deposits from a diverse customer base. The Company s deposit products include checking, savings, and term certificate accounts. The Company s loan portfolio includes commercial and consumer loans, a substantial portion of which are secured by real estate. 
 
 The Bank derives a significant portion of its income from interest received on loans and investments. The Bank s primary source of funding is deposits, both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing. In order to maximize the Bank s net interest income, or the difference between the income on interest-earning assets and the expense of interest-bearing liabilities, the Bank must not only manage the volume of these balance sheet items, but also the yields earned on interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. To account for credit risk inherent in all loans, the Bank maintains an ACL to absorb expected credit losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. The Bank establishes and maintains this ACL by charging a provision for credit losses against operating earnings. In order to maintain its operations and branch locations, the Bank incurs various operating expenses which are further described within the Results of Operations later in this section. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total consolidated assets of 7.9 billion, gross loans of 5.6 billion, total deposits of 6.6 billion, and total shareholders equity of 738.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 857 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Merger with Summit Financial Group, Inc. 
 Effective on the Closing Date, Burke Herbert completed the M erger with Summit, pursuant to the August 24, 2023 Merger Agreement. 
 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, (i) Summit merged with and into Burke Herbert through the Merger, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, SCB merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank. 
 
 In the Merger, holders of Summit common stock outstanding at the effective time of the Merger received 0.5043 shares of Burke Herbert common stock for each share of Summit common stock they owned, subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. The total aggregate consideration payable in the Merger was approximately 7,405,772 shares of Burke Herbert Common Stock. Additionally, each share of the Summit Series 2021 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding was converted into the right to receive a share of the new Burke Herbert Series 2021 Preferred Stock. Summit results of operations are included from the Closing Date forward. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and conform to general practices within the industry in which we operate. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions, and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements. 
 Our most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the other disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, we have identified business combination and goodwill, the 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 determination of the allowance for credit losses, and income taxes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 
 Business Combination and Goodwill 
 For acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles, and the liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. The difference between consideration and the net fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items, including projected cash flows, repayment rates, default rates and losses assuming default, discount rates, and realizable collateral values. The allowance for credit losses for PCD loans is recognized within acquisition accounting. The allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition. Fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities. The purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results, which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations. The carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. 
 The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. In addition, we engage third party specialists to assist in the development of fair values. Preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period. Management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and often involves a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued. Examples of such items include loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets, and certain other assets and liabilities. 
 Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets, including goodwill and liabilities, which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses represents our estimate of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and projections including reasonable and supportable forecasts, reversion, and post-reversion forecasts. It is a valuation account that is deducted from the financial assets amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. Financial assets are charged-off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a financial asset is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. 
 The Company s loan portfolio is the largest financial asset that is in scope of this critical accounting estimate. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate, because it is based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and prepayment experience as related to credit contractual terms. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses; adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, and delinquency levels, as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. The model methodology used for funded credits, along with taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding on unfunded commitments and whether such commitments are irrevocable or not by the Company, is how the Company determines the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments. These evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more frequently, if deemed necessary. 
 The Company is using an internally developed model that produces an estimate of the allowance for credit losses as the lifetime expected credit losses of the loan portfolio. This model uses a remaining useful life or WARM method within defined-contractual terms by federal call codes. The model forecasts net charge-off rates by call codes using ordinary least 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 squares OLS regression models that use macroeconomic variables to forecast the Company s and peer banks net charge-off rates. These models are used to produce reasonable and supportable forecasts of net charge-off rates. The macroeconomic variables utilized by the Company include variables that meet defined criteria in forecasting credit losses for our loan portfolio. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, housing and commercial real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, equity market conditions or interest rates, as well as other variables that are portfolio-specific, such as those pertaining to commercial real estate or to residential loan portfolios. The Company sources the macroeconomic variables and the macroeconomic variable forecasts that it uses in its ACL model from the Standard Poor s Global Market Intelligence and from CoStar Group. 
 
 The Company currently has set an initial reasonable and supportable period of two years with a subsequent straight-line loss-rate reversion for the following four quarters before then utilizing historical average loss rates in remaining periods of the modeled contractual terms. Based on management s analysis, adjustments may be applied for additional factors impacting the risk of loss in the loan portfolio beyond information used to calculate reasonable and supportable, reversion and post-reversion period forecasts on collectively evaluated loans. As the reasonable and supportable and reversion period forecasts reflect the use of the macroeconomic variable loss drivers, management may consider that an additional or reduced reserve is warranted through qualitative risk factors based on current and expected conditions, including those that utilize supplemental information relative to the macroeconomic variable loss drivers. Qualitative adjustments considered by management include the following: (i) management s assessment of macroeconomic forecasts used in the model and how those forecasts align with management s overall evaluation of current expected credit conditions; (ii) organization specific risks such as credit concentrations, collateral specific risks, nature and size of the portfolio, and external factors that may ultimately impact credit quality; and (iii) underwriting and delinquency trends. The qualitative factors applied at September 30, 2024, and the importance and levels of the qualitative factors applied, may change in future periods depending on the level of changes to items such as the uncertainty of economic conditions and management s assessment of the level of credit risk within the loan portfolio as a result of such changes, compared to the amount of ACL calculated by the model. Management reviews supplemental data sources including historical net charge-off rates and data measuring other specific credit outcomes from its systems of record in supporting qualitative factors. However, qualitative factor evaluations are inherently imprecise and require significant management judgement. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company s income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated taxes due. The calculation of each component of the Company s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination. As part of the Company s evaluation and implementation of business strategies, consideration is given to the regulations and tax laws that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any tax positions under evaluation. Management closely monitors tax developments on both the federal and state level in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments, as necessary. 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. In evaluating the Company s ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company must consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and the results of recent operations. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. See Note 8 Income Taxes, in Notes to the December 31, 2023, Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for additional information. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and also present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition and results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance). These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar names used by other companies. For more information, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their corresponding GAAP financial measures, see the respective sections where the measures are presented.

 Current Economic Environment in the Financial Services Industry 
 Commercial Real Estate Sector Concentration 
 The commercial real estate CRE sector has been impacted significantly by rising interest rates and higher vacancies, increasing the prospect of default that borrowers may face due to the record amount of upcoming maturities. In addition, the office market continues to struggle with fewer employees in the office after the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank continues to monitor its commercial real estate portfolio by reviewing various credit risk and concentration reports. The Bank s exposure to commercial real estate at September 30, 2024, was 2.5 billion, or 45.4 , of its gross loan portfolio, not including owner-occupied commercial real estate and acquisition, construction development. Commercial real estate as a percent of total assets at September 30, 2024, was 32.1 , not including owner-occupied commercial real estate and acquisition, construction development. Including owner-occupied commercial real estate and acquisition, construction development, total exposure was at 3.6 billion, or 64.8 , of our total gross loans and 45.9 of total assets at September 30, 2024. 
 Loan balances by portfolio segment amortized cost (in thousands) and by percentage of our total gross loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 Amortized Cost Percentage Commercial real estate 2,526,945 45.4 Owner-occupied commercial real estate 637,175 11.4 Acquisition, construction development 447,449 8.0 Commercial industrial 562,653 10.1 Single family residential (1-4 units) 1,197,245 21.5 Consumer non-real estate and other 202,570 3.6 Total gross loans 5,574,037 100.0 
 Monitoring of the CRE concentration is performed at both the loan level and at the portfolio level. The Credit Risk Management team provides management and the Board of Directors with periodic reports on the credit portfolio, which include the CRE portfolio (including owner-occupied CRE and acquisition, construction development loans). These reports provide an assessment of asset quality and risk rating migration and monitor concentrations against the board approved concentration limits (including sub-limits). The tables below present the Bank s commercial real estate, owner-occupied commercial real estate, and acquisition, construction development portfolios by collateral type and geographic location as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).

 CRE loans are monitored through various processes that include payment monitoring, financial reporting, and covenant compliance monitoring, and annual reviews for larger relationships. Furthermore, construction loans are monitored throughout the life of the project and the construction loan administration function is centralized within the Credit Risk Management team. Monitoring the market conditions is also an important component of prudent CRE risk management. Quarterly construction progress reviews are also completed on all acquisition, construction development loans. For each loan, management reviews the adequacy of the construction budget, adequacy of the interest reserve, pace of construction, and review of any loan covenants. 
 The Bank believes its underwriting and monitoring standards for commercial real estate loans are sufficient to evaluate its loan portfolio and keep it from incurring significant losses. The largest concentration of the Bank s commercial real estate loans are in Virginia (approximately 46.1 ), and the Bank does not have significant exposure to any economic areas of the country that are underperforming the national economy. Additionally, the Bank s overall exposure to the Office Building / Condo collateral type is 17.2 of total commercial real estate loans, including owner-occupied commercial real estate and acquisition, construction development. The Bank believes that the combined loan portfolio is well-diversified, generally seasoned, manageable, and will outperform the industry in terms of performance through the economic cycle; however, our underwriting, review, and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans. For further discussion see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 2023 Banking Failures and Ensuing Banking Industry Liquidity Concerns 
 In response to the bank failures that occurred during March and May 2023 and the attendant stress on economic agents, including various financial markets, the Company took multiple proactive measures to mitigate any potential financial and operational impacts. Such measures included, but were not limited to: 
 dissemination of internal communication to inform the Board and employees of current events and the Company s condition and desired market response; 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 testing of available liquidity sources; 
 real-time analysis of our deposit composition and deposit concentrations; 
 assessment of our investment securities portfolio; and 
 stress testing of liquidity and capital metrics based on observed financial conditions with particular emphasis on the causes of such risk events. 
 For further discussion see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors . The measures were taken following meetings convened by a subcommittee provided for in our Asset/Liability policy more fully described in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 
 The Company s key inputs and certain assumptions of the stress testing included, but were not limited to, uninsured deposits, deposit composition and deposit flows, borrowings and borrowing capacity, interest rate movements and sensitivity, unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio, loan balances and loan demand, credit risks, and current allowances for credit losses. Results of the stress tests indicated capital levels that remained above the well capitalized regulatory ratios and liquidity metrics remained within internal policy guidelines. For additional information related to capital, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 8 Regulatory Capital Matters . The Company intends to continue conducting such stress tests on a periodic basis. 
 Liquidity Management 
 Liquidity is the ability of the Company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining the Company s ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of its customers, whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs. Without proper liquidity management, the Company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would, therefore, not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves. 
 The Company assesses the need for liquidity in a variety of scenarios. Those scenarios may include projected growth, credit deterioration, deposit decay, interest rate changes, and a variety of other economic scenarios that can impact the liquidity position of the Company. These analyses are performed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with the Company s Asset/Liability meetings, and findings are reported to the Asset/Liability Committee (the ALCO and to the Board. From time to time, management may change the frequency of such testing or update certain inputs as a result of abnormal market conditions. 
 Findings, as a result of the Company s prudent liquidity modeling, may result in the change of certain products offered to customers or adjust the way the Company manages its balance sheet. Such changes could include adjusting interest rates offered on certain deposit products, changes to interest rates charged in lending activities, or the suspension of certain products and activities altogether. Times of significant economic stress may cause the mix of funding to shift and increase the likelihood of changes to certain products in order to manage the Company s overall liquidity and capital position. 
 The asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through unencumbered securities available-for-sale, loan principal and interest payments, maturities and prepayments of investment securities, and, to a lesser extent, sales of investment securities available-for-sale. Other short-term investments available to the Company that could act as potential sources of liquidity are federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and maturing interest-bearing deposits with other banks. 
 The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts and through FHLB and other borrowings. Brokered deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other short-term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and basically represent the Company s incremental borrowing capacity. These sources of liquidity are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short-term liquidity needs. 
 In addition to the Company s financial performance and condition, liquidity may be impacted by the Company s structure as a financial holding company that is a separate legal entity from the Bank. The Company requires cash for various operating needs that could include payment of dividends to its shareholders, the servicing of debt, and the payment of general corporate expenses. The primary source of liquidity for the Company is dividends paid by the Bank. Applicable

Table of Contents 

 federal and state statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. In addition to the formal statutes and regulations, regulatory authorities also consider the adequacy of the Bank s total capital in relation to its assets, deposits, and other such items. Any future dividends must be set forth in the Company s capital plans before any dividends can be paid. 
 Management believes that the current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet the Company s requirements and plans for continued growth. See Note 6 - Borrowed Funds and Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations. 
 Capital 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Applicable Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 CET 1 ), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios, along with a capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in new minimum capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and counter-cyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a counter-cyclical capital buffer that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank. 
 Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action , the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 Additionally, federal banking laws require regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not satisfy minimum capital requirements. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is well capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized , or critically undercapitalized , as such terms are defined under federal banking agency regulations. Depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements will face constraints on payment of dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of shortfall. A depository institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market, may be subject to asset growth limitations, and may be required to submit capital restoration plans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank complied with all regulatory capital standards and qualifies as well capitalized . Note 8 - Regulatory Capital Matters in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional discussion and analysis regarding the Company and the Bank s regulatory capital requirements. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher-than-normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation. 
 Management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of the Company s ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. Management attempts to maintain a balanced position between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities over an economic cycle in order to minimize the impact of interest rate

 fluctuations on net interest income. However, this goal can be difficult to completely achieve in times of rapidly changing interest rates and is one of many factors considered in determining the Company s interest rate positioning. 
 Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance 
 We face a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our financial performance from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current business and economic conditions, political and regulatory environment, and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this Report as well as with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Form 10-K. 
 Our success will depend upon, among other things, the following factors that we manage or control: 
 Effectively managing capital and liquidity, including: 
 Continuing to maintain and, over time, grow our deposit base as a low-cost stable funding source, 
 Prudent liquidity and capital management to meet evolving regulatory capital, capital planning, stress testing, and liquidity standards, and 
 Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets, 
 Our ability to manage any material costs related to the execution of our strategic priorities, including increased employees, infrastructure, compliance, and other costs in a profitable manner over the long term, 
 Management of credit risk and interest rate risk in our portfolio, 
 Our ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment, 
 The impact of legal and regulatory-related contingencies, 
 The appropriateness of critical accounting estimates and related contingencies, 
 Our ability to manage operational risks related to new products and services, changes in processes and procedures, or the implementation of new technology, 
 The ability to make investments to promote compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements that will increase as the Company grows and will result in increased administrative expenses that we did not previously incur, which costs may materially increase our general and administrative expenses, and 
 The ability to execute our strategic objectives, including successfully integrating Summit s operations, people, and technology with ours, and continuing to efficiently satisfy the obligations associated with being a public company, all of which will require significant resources and management attention and may divert management s attention from our business operations. 
 Our financial performance is also substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following: 
 Economic conditions, including the length and extent of the economic impacts of events affecting the financial services market generally as well as pandemics and political instability and conflicts, and any actions taken to mitigate and manage such impacts, 
 The effect of climate change on our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers, 
 The actions by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates and inflation, 
 The level of, and direction, timing, and magnitude of movement in interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve,

 Results of Operations 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 
 General 
 Net income applicable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 15.5 million compared to net income applicable to common shares of 17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.1 million decrease in net income applicable to common shares was primarily the result of merger related expenses and one-time CECL Day 2 provision for non-PCD assets acquired in the Merger for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income increased by 83.6 million to 155.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 71.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The main driver for this increase was the impact of the Merger. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded credit provision expense of 23.4 million compared to a provision of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a one-time CECL Day 2 provision for non-PCD assets acquired in the Merger, which

 resulted in a higher credit provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended, September 30, 2023. 
 Non-interest income increased by 11.2 million, or 85.7 , to 24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the Merger. In addition, the Company liquidated the majority of the acquired securities portfolio that resulted in a gain on sale of securities of 0.6 million. 
 Non-interest expense increased by 72.3 million, or 112.7 , to 136.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 64.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to effect of the Merger and also included higher legal fees, consulting fees, audit fees, investment banking fees, software contract terminations, change-in-control salary and benefit payments, funding a charitable donation (as part of the Merger Agreement), and other expenses related to the Merger. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 27.5 million of expenses related to the Merger with Summit. 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest income is the principal component of the Company s income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin, stated as a percentage, is the yield obtained by dividing the difference between interest income generated on earning assets and the interest expense paid on all funding sources by average earning assets. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can impact net interest income and net interest margin. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin and seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk through our asset and liability policies. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. 
 Net interest income totaled 155.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 71.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest earning assets, higher rates, and higher accretion income, as a result of the Merger. Accretion income associated with acquired loans and borrowings totaled 28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Amortization expense associated with fair value marks for time deposits, subordinated debt, and trust preferred securities totaled 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The tax-adjusted net interest margin was 3.78 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in tax-adjusted net interest margin was primarily driven by the effect of the Merger and the acquisition of additional, higher-yielding interest-earning assets. 
 The yield for the taxable loan portfolio was 7.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of the effect of the Merger which resulted in the acquisition of additional, higher-yielding loans. 
 The tax-adjusted yield on the total investment securities portfolio was 3.81 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.42 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partly due to higher yields in our investment portfolio in addition to the Merger, which resulted in the acquisition of additional securities with higher tax-adjusted yields. 
 The yield on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.86 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.70 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of the Merger which resulted in the assumption of additional interest-bearing deposits with higher interest rates and to a lesser extent by higher market interest rates. 
 The yield on our short-term borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 4.42 , compared to 4.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to decreases in the Federal Funds Rate and other short-term market rates. The yield on our subordinated debt acquired in the Merger was 10.21 . 
 The following table sets forth the major components of net interest income and the related yields and rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, for comparison (dollars in thousands).

 Taxable-equivalent net interest margin, as presented above, is calculated by dividing fully-taxable equivalent FTE net interest income by total average earning assets. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes to provide a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Management believes FTE net interest income is a standard practice in the banking industry, and when net interest income is adjusted on an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. FTE net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on certain financial interest-earning assets, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. As a non-GAAP measure, FTE net interest income should not be considered as a substitute for the nearest comparable GAAP measure, net interest income. Net interest income shown elsewhere in this presentation is GAAP net interest income. The following table reconciles GAAP net interest income to FTE net interest income (in thousands).

 Yield/Rate and Volume Analysis 
 The following table sets forth the dollar difference in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the noted periods and the amount of such change attributable to changes in average balances (volume) or changes in average interest rates. Interest income and interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, are annualized using an actual days over calendar year method. The volume variances are equal to the increase or decrease in average balance multiplied by current period rates, and rate variances are equal to the increase or decrease in rate times prior period average balances. Variances attributable to both rate and volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in average balance and are allocated to the volume variance. See table below (in thousands).

 Interest Income 
 Total interest income was 253.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 108.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 133.1 . The increase in interest income was due to the effect of the Merger and the acquisition of additional interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased by 139.0 million and interest income on securities increased 4.6 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Total interest expense was 98.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 37.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was a result of the Merger and the assumption of additional interest-bearing liabilities. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds increased by 56.0 million and 0.3 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 
 General 
 Net income applicable to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 27.4 million, compared to net income applicable to common shares of 4.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 23.3 million increase was primarily due to results that reflect combined income after the Merger completion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net interest income increased by 50.3 million to 73.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The main driver for this increase was the impact of the Merger. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded credit provision expense of 0.1 million compared to a provision of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized less credit loss expense on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures which led to a decrease in credit provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-interest income increased by 6.3 million, or 147.5 , to 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the Merger. All categories of non-interest income increased as a result of the combined operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Non-interest expense increased by 28.4 million, or 126.7 , to 50.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 22.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to effect of the Merger and also included higher legal fees, consulting fees, audit fees, investment banking fees, software contract terminations, and other expenses related to the Merger. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 3.1 million of expenses related to the Merger with Summit. 
 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 
 Net interest income is the principal component of the Company s income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest margin, stated as a percentage, is the yield obtained by dividing the difference between interest income generated on earning assets and the interest expense paid on all funding sources by average earning assets. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can impact net interest income and net interest margin. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin and seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk through our asset and liability policies. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. 
 Net interest income totaled 73.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest earning assets, higher rates, and higher accretion income, as a result of the Merger. Accretion income associated with acquired loans and borrowings totaled 15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Amortization expense associated with fair value marks for time deposits, subordinated debt, and trust preferred securities totaled 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The tax-adjusted net interest margin was 4.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in tax-adjusted net interest margin was primarily driven by the effect of the Merger and the acquisition of additional, higher-yielding interest-earning assets. 
 The yield for the taxable loan portfolio was 7.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of the effect of the Merger, which resulted in the acquisition of additional, higher-yielding loans.

Table of Contents 

 The tax-adjusted yield on the total investment securities portfolio was 3.91 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partly due to higher yields in our investment portfolio in addition to the Merger, which resulted in the acquisition of additional securities with higher tax-adjusted yields. 
 The yield on interest-bearing deposits increased to 3.02 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.09 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of the Merger, which resulted in the assumption of additional interest-bearing deposits with higher interest rates, and to a lesser extent, by higher market interest rates compared to the prior year quarter. 
 The yield on our short-term borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 4.06 , compared to 4.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to decreases in the Federal Funds Rate and other short-term market rates. The yield on our subordinated debt assumed in the Merger was 10.16 . 
 The following table sets forth the major components of net interest income and the related yields and rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, for comparison (dollars in thousands).

 Taxable-equivalent net interest margin, as presented above, is calculated by dividing FTE net interest income by total average earning assets. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes to provide a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Management believes FTE net interest income is a standard practice in the banking industry, and when net interest income is adjusted on an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. FTE net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit on certain financial interest-earning assets, whose interest is tax-exempt, to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. As a non-GAAP measure, FTE net interest income should not be considered as a substitute for the nearest comparable GAAP measure, net interest income. Net interest income shown elsewhere in this presentation is GAAP net interest income. The following table reconciles GAAP net interest income to FTE net interest income (in thousands).

 Yield/Rate and Volume Analysis 
 The following table sets forth the dollar difference in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the noted periods and the amount of such change attributable to changes in average balances (volume) or changes in average interest rates. Interest income and interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, are annualized using an actual days over calendar year method. Volume variances are equal to the increase or decrease in average balance multiplied by current period rates, and rate variances are equal to the increase or decrease in rate times prior period average balances. Variances attributable to both rate and volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in average balance and are allocated to the volume variance. See table below (in thousands).

 Provision for (Recapture of) Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreased provision expense is a function of the Merger closing last quarter and the Day 2 non-PCD provision expense captured for the acquired portfolio, resulting in a lower credit loss expense on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 4 - Allowance for Credit Losses in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 Due mostly to the Merger, assets increased by 4.25 billion to 7.86 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.62 billion as of December 31, 2023. Loans, net of ACL, increased by 3.44 billion from 2.06 billion as of December 31, 2023, to 5.51 billion as of September 30, 2024. Deposits increased by 3.60 billion and amounted to 6.60 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.00 billion at December 31, 2023. Short-term borrowings increased by 48.2 million to 320.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 272.0 million at December 31, 2023. Subordinated debt and

 subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts, which were assumed in the Merger, totaled 110.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to zero at December 31, 2023. 
 Investment Securities 
 Our investment policy is established and reviewed annually by the Board. We are permitted under federal law to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Government obligations, securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities, time deposits of federally insured institutions, certain bankers acceptances, and federal funds. Our securities are all classified as AFS. 
 Our investments provide a source of liquidity because we can pledge them to support borrowed funds or can liquidate them to generate cash proceeds. Our investment portfolio is also a resource in managing interest rate risk because the maturity and interest rate characteristics of this asset class can be modified to match changes in the loan and deposit portfolios. The majority of our AFS investment portfolio is comprised of obligations of states and municipalities and residential mortgage-backed securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses on our holdings decreased 36.3 million from December 31, 2023. 
 The Company determined that the declines in market value were due to increases in interest rates and market movements and not due to credit factors. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the unrealized losses for the AFS securities do not require an ACL at September 30, 2024, or at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company has sufficient access to liquidity such that management does not believe it would be necessary to sell any of its investment securities at a loss to offset any unexpected deposit outflows. Management believes the structure of the Bank s investment portfolio is appropriately aligned with the rest of the balance sheet to protect against significant and unexpected charges against earnings and capital.

 Lending Activities 
 Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate loans, but we offer a variety of products to meet the credit needs of our borrowers. The risks associated with lending activities differ among loan classes and are subject to the impact of changes in interest rates, market conditions of collateral securing the loans, and general economic conditions. Any of these factors may adversely impact a borrower s ability to repay loans and also impact the associated collateral. Additional discussion on the classes of loans the Company makes and related risks is included in Note 3 Loans in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Asset Quality 
 The Company maintains policies and procedures to promote sound underwriting and mitigate credit risk. The Chief Credit Officer is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of the Company s lending-related transactions. 
 A loan is placed on non-accrual status when (i) the Company is advised by the borrower that scheduled principal or interest payments cannot be met, (ii) when management s best judgment indicates that payment in full of principal and interest can no longer be expected, or (iii) when any such loan or obligation becomes delinquent for 90 days, unless it is both well-secured and in the process of collection. 
 The Company s asset quality remained stable through the third quarter of 2024, but the nonaccrual loan balance increased 32.1 million from December 31, 2023. As a result of the Merger, the nonaccrual loan balance increased due to the acquired loan portfolio. The Company s non-performing assets, which includes non-performing loans consisting of non-accrual loans, loans that are more than 90 days past due and still accruing, and other real estate owned as of September 30, 2024, totaled 38.4 million.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Refer to the discussion in Note 1. Nature of Business Activities and Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for management s approach to estimating the ACL. 
 The Company maintains the ACL at a level deemed adequate by management for expected credit losses. On January 1, 2023, the Company implemented CECL and increased the ACL, previously the allowance for loan losses, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the ACL for credit losses of 4.4 million, which included a cumulative-effect adjustment to the ACL for off-balance sheet exposures of 274.8 thousand. The Company s ACL is calculated quarterly with any adjustment recorded to the provision for credit losses in the consolidated Statement of Income. Management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL utilizing a defined methodology to determine if it properly addresses the current and expected risks in the loan portfolio, which considers the performance of borrowers and specific evaluation of individually evaluated loans, including historical loss experiences, trends in delinquencies, non-performing loans and other risk assets, and qualitative factors. Risk factors are continuously reviewed and adjusted, as needed, by management when conditions support a change. Management believes its approach properly addresses relevant accounting and bank regulatory guidance for loans both collectively and individually evaluated. 
 The Company recorded a provision expense of 0.1 million and a provision expense of 0.2 million on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and a provision expense of 19.5 million and a provision expense of 1.0 million on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in provision expense for the nine months ended was due to the Merger and the requirement to record a provision expense for loans classified as non-PCD. The Company also recorded a 23.9 million provision directly to the allowance for credit losses as required for acquired PCD loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This allowance for acquired PCD loans did not result in an additional provision expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gross charged-off loans were 305.0 thousand and 13.0 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 947.0 thousand and 134.0 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Gross recoveries totaled 20.0 thousand and 5.0 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 38.0 thousand and 48.0 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The ACL as a percentage of gross loans, net of unearned income, was 1.22 and 1.26 as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset/liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments at fair value as either other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s use of derivative financial instruments is described more fully in Note 9 Derivatives in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company enters into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees which would impact the Company s liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and/or use these commitments. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of credit extension commitments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. With the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 Funding Activities 
 The Company s funding activities are monitored and governed through the Company s asset/liability management process. Deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investing activities; however, the Company will use borrowings to meet liquidity needs and for temporary funding. The Company has available secured lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, such as the Borrower-In-Custody program, the FHLB of Atlanta, and unsecured federal funds

 lines of credit from correspondent banking relationships. The Company also utilizes brokered time deposits. For more discussion of brokered time deposits, see the Deposits heading below this section. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has available unused borrowing capacity of 2.4 billion through its available lines of credit with the FHLB of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve Borrower-In-Custody Program line, and unsecured federal fund lines of credit from correspondent banking relationships. Advances on credit lines are secured by both securities and loans.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending, investment, and deposit-taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure, and on at least a quarterly basis, in conjunction with the Company s Asset/Liability meetings, reports its findings to the ALCO and to the Board. From time to time, management may change the frequency of such testing or update certain inputs as a result of abnormal market conditions. Our profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates; a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. We monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income using several tools. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , Recent Events in the Financial Services Industry. 
 
 Our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital, while configuring our asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. We rely primarily on our asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk. 
 In addition, the Company s Asset/Liability policy provides for a subcommittee of the ALCO, comprised of executive and senior management that, upon the determination that abnormal market risks are occurring or may be forthcoming, will convene with the responsibility of making all decisions related to mitigation of potential negative impacts to the Company. This subcommittee acts as a clearinghouse for information on Company earnings, credit risk, lending and deposit activities, and liquidity management necessary for internal communications, including to the Board, and external communications. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and fair value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricing and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay home mortgage loans at any time, depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve, where interest rates increase or decrease in a non-parallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and SOFR (basis risk). 
 The rates on some interest-bearing financial instruments may adjust promptly with changes in market rates, while others adjust only periodically or are fixed for a predefined term. Such instances can cause a mismatch between the sensitivity and behavior of financial assets and liabilities. Interest rate fluctuations and economic factors, coupled with repricing mismatches and embedded options inherent in these financial assets and liabilities, may impact the Company s interest expense, interest income, and the value of certain financial assets and liabilities. Through the ALCO, we attempt to manage the balance sheet in a manner that increases the benefit or reduces the negative impacts from such events. 
 The overall impact of changes in interest rates, including, but not limited to, the impact to our net interest income and to our securities portfolio, can be enhanced or diluted depending on the variability of interest rates. From time to time, the Company may hedge its interest rate risk position, which can impact earnings. We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk, nor can we guarantee that any attempts to do so will be successful. See Note 9 - Derivatives in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our hedging activity. 
 The Company actively manages its interest rate sensitivity position. The objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve sustainable growth in net interest income. The ALCO, using policies and procedures approved by the Company s Board, is responsible for the management of the Company s interest rate sensitivity position. The Company manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix, pricing and re-pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities, through the management of its investment portfolio, its offerings of loan and selected deposit terms, and through wholesale funding. Wholesale funding consists of, but is not limited to, borrowings with the FHLB, federal funds purchased, and brokered time deposits. 
 The Company uses several tools to manage its interest rate risk, including interest rate sensitivity analysis, or gap analysis, market value of portfolio equity analysis, interest rate simulations under various rate scenarios, and net interest margin 
 77 

Table of Contents 

 reports. The results of these reports are compared to limits established by the Company s ALCO policies, and appropriate adjustments are made if the results are outside the established limits. 
 There are an infinite number of potential interest rate scenarios, each of which can be accompanied by differing economic/political/regulatory climates; can generate multiple differing behavior patterns by markets, borrowers, depositors, etc.; and, can last for varying degrees of time. Therefore, by definition, interest rate risk sensitivity cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, the Company s interest rate risk measurement philosophy focuses on maintaining an appropriate balance between theoretical and practical scenarios; especially given the primary objective of the Company s overall asset/liability management process, which is to facilitate meaningful strategy development and implementation. 
 Therefore, we model a set of interest rate scenarios capturing the financial effects of a range of plausible rate scenarios; the collective impact of which will enable the Company to clearly understand the nature and extent of its sensitivity to interest rate changes. Doing so necessitates an assessment of rate changes over varying time horizons and of varying/sufficient degrees such that the impact of embedded options within the balance sheet are sufficiently examined. 
 The following tables demonstrate the annualized result of an interest rate simulation and the estimated effect that a parallel interest rate shift, or shock , in the yield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing might have on the Company s projected income over the next 12 months. This simulation assumes that there is no growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next 12 months.

 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and regulations are designed and operating in an effective manner. 
 Effective on May 3, 2024, Burke Herbert completed its M erger with Summit. During the second and third quarter of 2024, management commenced an evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting related to the Summit acquired business. The evaluation of changes to processes, technology systems, and other components of internal control over financial reporting related to the Summit acquired business is ongoing. Except for the changes made in connection with the Merger, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of our operations, and from time to time, the Company and its subsidiary are parties to various legal claims, lawsuits, and proceedings incidental to the ordinary nature of the Company s business. Currently, we are not party to any material legal proceedings, and no such proceedings are, to management s knowledge, threatened against us. Although the ultimate outcome of any pending legal proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion of management that the liabilities (if any) resulting from such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, including its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, or otherwise require disclosure under the federal securities laws.
