 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to our plans, strategies and expectations, near-term loan growth, net interest margin, mortgage banking profits, wealth management fees, expenses, asset quality, capital levels, continued earnings, and liquidity. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of the words "believe," "may," "will," "should," "could," "expect," "estimate," "intend," "anticipate," "project," "plan" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are frequently based on assumptions that may or may not materialize and are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated or projected and which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or prospects include, but are not limited to: 
 the strength of the local, state, national, and international economies (including effects of inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints); 
 the economic impact of any future terrorist threats and attacks, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of war or other threats thereof (including the conflict in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine), or other adverse external events that could cause economic deterioration or instability in credit markets, and the response of the local, state and national governments to any such adverse external events; 
 changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by state and federal regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 
 changes in state and federal laws, regulations and governmental policies concerning the Company s general business and any changes in response to the failures of other banks or as a result of the upcoming 2024 presidential election; 
 changes in interest rates and prepayment rates of the Company s assets; 
 increased competition in the financial services sector, including from non-bank competitors such as credit unions and fintech companies, and the inability to attract new customers; 
 changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; 
 unexpected results of acquisitions, which may include failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and the possibility that transaction costs may be greater than anticipated; 
 the loss of key executives or employees; 
 changes in consumer spending; 
 unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation involving the Company; 
 the economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, floods and blizzards; 
 fluctuations in the value of securities held in our securities portfolio; 
 concentrations within our loan portfolio (including commercial real estate loans), large loans to certain borrowers, and large deposits from certain clients above current FDIC limits who may withdraw deposits to diversify their exposure; 
 the level of non-performing assets on our balance sheets; 
 interruptions involving our information technology and communications systems or third-party servicers; 
 breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents; 
 our asset quality and any loan charge-offs; 
 the effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin, our investments, our loan originations, and our modeling estimates relating to interest rate changes; 
 our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; 
 our inability to receive dividends from the Bank, pay dividends to our common stockholders or satisfy obligations as they become due; 
 the effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions; 
 our ability to achieve organic loan and deposit growth and the composition of such growth; 
 our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services; 
 current and future business, economic and market conditions in the United States ("U.S.") generally or in the States of Illinois and Iowa in particular; 
 the geographic concentration of our operations in the States of Illinois and Iowa; 
 our ability to attract and retain customer deposits; 
 our ability to maintain the Bank s reputation; 
 possible impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets;

 the effectiveness of our risk management and internal disclosure controls and procedures; 
 market perceptions associated with certain aspects of our business; 
 our ability to meet our obligations as a public company, including our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
 our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items; and 
 the factors discussed in "Risk Factors", "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" or elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange SEC Commission on March 6, 2024. 
 These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the future, or to reflect circumstances and events that occur after the date on which the forward-looking statement was made.

 In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value and that contractual sale restrictions cannot be recognized and measured as a separate unit of account. The amendments in this update are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those years. This standard did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial position.

 of the issued and outstanding common stock of Town and Country Financial Corporation Town and Country ), the holding company for Town and Country Bank, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated August 23, 2022. Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, Town and Country merged with and into HBT Financial, with HBT Financial as the surviving entity, immediately followed by the merger of Town and Country Bank with and into Heartland Bank, with Heartland Bank as the surviving entity. 
 At the effective time of the merger, each share of Town and Country was converted into the right to receive, subject to the election and proration procedures as provided in the Merger Agreement, one of the following: (i) shares of HBT Financial s common stock, or (ii) in cash, or (iii) a combination of cash and HBT Financial common stock. Total consideration consisted of shares of HBT Financial s common stock and million in cash. In lieu of fractional shares, holders of Town and Country common stock received cash. Based upon the closing price of HBT Financial common stock of on February 1, 2023, the aggregate transaction value was approximately million. 
 This transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to after the closing date of February 1, 2023. Measurement period adjustments of million were recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as more information became available regarding Town and Country's tax assets and liabilities. Goodwill of million was recorded in the acquisition, which reflects expected synergies from combining the operations of HBT Financial and Town and Country, and is nondeductible for tax purposes. 
 The acquisition of Town and Country further enhanced HBT Financial s footprint in central Illinois, and expanded our footprint into metro-east St. Louis. Acquisition-related expenses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are summarized below. There were Town and Country acquisition-related expenses recognized subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.

 Additionally, subsequent to the Town and Country acquisition, HBT Financial recognized an allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans of million and an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments of million through an increase to the provision for credit losses. 
 The following table provides the pro forma information for the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as if the acquisition of Town and Country had occurred on January 1, 2022. The pro forma results combine the historical results of Town and Country into HBT Financial s consolidated statements of income, including the impact of certain acquisition accounting adjustments, which include loan discount accretion, intangible assets amortization, deposit premium amortization, and borrowing premium amortization. The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been obtained had the acquisition actually occurred on January 1, 2022. No assumptions have been applied to the pro forma results of operations regarding possible revenue enhancements, provision for credit losses, expense efficiencies or asset dispositions.

 As of September 30, 2024, there were debt securities in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or more, and debt securities in an unrealized loss position for a period of less than twelve months. 
 U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, and agency mortgage-backed securities are considered to have no risk of credit loss as they are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The changes in fair value in these portfolios are considered to be primarily driven by changes in market interest rates and other non-credit risks, such as prepayment and liquidity risks.

 general obligation bonds as of September 30, 2024, which have a very low historical default rate due to issuers generally having taxing authority to service the debt. The remainder of the municipal securities are also of high credit quality with ratings of Aa3/AA- or better. The Company evaluates credit risk through monitoring credit ratings and reviews of available financial data. The changes in fair value in these portfolios are considered to be primarily driven by changes in market interest rates and other non-credit risks, such as call and liquidity risks. The estimated allowance for credit losses for the municipal debt securities held-to-maturity was deemed insignificant. 
 Corporate securities include investment grade corporate and bank subordinated debt securities. The Company evaluates credit risk through monitoring credit ratings, reviews of available issuer financial data, and sector trends. During 2024, the changes in fair value in corporate securities were considered to be primarily driven by changes in market interest rates and other non-credit risks, such as call and liquidity risks. There was allowance for credit losses recorded on corporate debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 During the first half of 2023, a provision for credit losses of million was recognized, related to one bank subordinated debt security reflecting heightened potential credit risk following the failures of other banks in 2023. This heightened potential credit risk was later reduced after a merger announcement by the issuer of the bank subordinated debt security and a negative provision for credit losses of million was recorded during the third quarter of 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell the debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position, and it was more likely than not that the Company would recover the amortized cost prior to being required to sell the debt securities. 
 Accrued interest on debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million of the special mention loans would have been considered pass-watch and million would have been considered substandard under the previous risk rating categories. 
 The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans and periodically performs detailed internal reviews of all such loans that are part of relationships with over thousand in total exposure to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio. These risk ratings are also subject to review by the Company s regulators, external loan review, and internal loan review. During the internal reviews, management monitors and analyzes the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, trends in the industries in which the borrowers operate and the fair values of collateral securing the loans. The risk rating is reviewed annually, at a minimum, and on an as needed basis depending on the specific circumstances of the loan. These credit quality indicators are used to assign a risk rating to each individual loan. Risk ratings are grouped into the following major categories: 
 Pass a pass loan is a credit with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention. 
 Pass-Watch a pass-watch loan is still considered a "pass" credit and is not a classified or criticized asset, but is a reflection of a borrower who exhibits credit weaknesses or downward trends warranting close attention and increased monitoring. These potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan. No loss of principal or interest is expected, and the borrower does not pose sufficient risk to warrant a special mention, substandard, or doubtful classification. 
 Special Mention a special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the assets or in the institution's credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
 Substandard a substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized as probable that the borrower will not pay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms. 
 Doubtful a doubtful loan has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. There were loans classified as Doubtful as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The Company estimated the fair value of lending related commitments as described in Note 14 to be immaterial based on limited interest rate exposure due to their variable nature, short-term commitment periods, and termination clauses provided in the agreements. 
 Limitations 
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 Fair values have been estimated using data which management considered the best available and estimation methodologies deemed suitable for the pertinent category of financial instrument.

 NOTE 14 
 Standby letters of credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, by the Bank upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and income-producing properties. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support extensions of credit. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Bank secures the standby letters of credit with the same collateral used to secure the related loan. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Lending-related Commitments 
 The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancelable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is adjusted through a charge to provision for credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of income. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Heartland Bank and Trust Company v. Meadows Mennonite Retirement Community Association, Inc. 
 This lawsuit arises out of a suit filed in the Circuit Court of Woodford County, Illinois, (the "Trial Court") by the Bank for breach of a note and commercial security agreement. The defendant, Meadows Mennonite Retirement Community Association, Inc. ("Meadows"), a beneficiary of a trust for which Bank was trustee, filed a counterclaim for rescission of the note seeking compensatory and punitive damages, including attorneys fees. In September 2024, the Appellate Court of Illinois Fourth District (the "Appellate Court") entered an order directing that summary judgment should be entered in favor of Meadows and against the Bank, rescinding the note and commercial security agreement. The Appellate Court remanded the case to the Trial Court which will now determine Meadows' compensatory and punitive damages, including reasonable attorneys fees. 
 The Bank intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. However, the Company believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible at this time, as that term is used in assessing loss contingencies. The Company is unable to predict when the matter will be resolved or potential costs or damages to be incurred.

We hold a leading deposit share in many of our central Illinois markets, which we define as a top three deposit share rank, providing the foundation for our strong deposit base. The stability provided by this low-cost funding is a key driver of our strong track record of financial performance. Below is a summary of our loan and deposit balances by geographic region:

 Town and Country Acquisition 
 On February 1, 2023, HBT Financial completed its acquisition of Town and Country, the holding company for Town and Country Bank. The acquisition of Town and Country further enhanced HBT Financial s footprint in central Illinois and expanded our footprint into metro-east St. Louis. At the time of acquisition, Town and Country Bank operated 10 full-service branch locations which began operating as branches of Heartland Bank. The core system conversion was successfully completed in April 2023. After considering business combination accounting adjustments, Town and Country added total assets of 937 million, total loans held for investment of 635 million, and total deposits of 720 million. 
 Total consideration consisted of 3.4 million shares of HBT Financial s common stock and 38.0 million in cash. Based upon the closing price of HBT Financial common stock of 21.12 on February 1, 2023, the aggregate consideration was approximately 109.4 million. Goodwill of 30.5 million was recorded in the acquisition.

 FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Below are selected factors that could affect the Company s operating results. For a fuller discussion of the factors that could have a material impact on the operations and future prospects of the Company, see the "Risk Factors" section included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024. 
 Economic Conditions 
 The Company's business and financial performance are affected by economic conditions generally in the U.S. and more directly in the Illinois and Iowa markets where we primarily operate. The significant economic factors relevant to our business and our financial performance include the general economic conditions in the U.S. and in the Company's markets (including the effect of inflationary pressures), unemployment rates, real estate markets, and interest rates. 
 Interest Rates 
 Net interest income is our primary source of revenue. Net interest income is equal to the excess of interest income earned on interest earning assets (including discount accretion on purchased loans plus certain loan fees) over interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. The level of interest rates as well as the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities both impact net interest income. Net interest income is also influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board FRB ), and market interest rates. 
 The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, which are primarily driven by the FRB s actions. The yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by short-term and long-term interest rates, which are set by the market and, to some degree, by the FRB s actions. Our net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. Generally, we expect increases in market interest rates will increase our net interest income and net interest margin in future periods, while decreases in market interest rates may decrease our net interest income and net interest margin in future periods; however, this depends upon the timing and extent of interest rate fluctuations and may not always be the case. 
 Credit Trends 
 We focus on originating loans with appropriate risk/reward profiles. We have a detailed loan policy that guides our overall loan origination philosophy and a well-established loan approval process that requires experienced credit officers to approve larger loan relationships. Although we believe our loan approval and credit review processes are strengths that allow us to maintain a high-quality loan portfolio, we recognize that credit trends in the markets in which we operate and in our loan portfolio can materially impact our financial condition and performance and that these trends are primarily driven by the economic conditions in our markets. 
 Competition 
 Our profitability and growth are affected by the highly competitive nature of the financial services industry. We compete with community banks in all our markets and, to a lesser extent, with regional and national banks, primarily in the Chicago MSA. Additionally, we compete with non-bank financial services companies, FinTechs and other financial institutions operating within the areas we serve. We compete by emphasizing personalized service and efficient decision-making tailored to individual needs. We do not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of our loans or our deposits. We continue to see significant competitive pressure on loan rates and terms, as well as deposit pricing, which may affect our financial results in the future.

 Digital Banking 
 Throughout the banking industry, in-person branch traffic is expected to continue to decline as more customers turn to digital banking for routine banking transactions. Additionally, widespread adoption of faster payment and instant payment technologies could require us to substantially increase our expenditures on technology and cybersecurity infrastructure, increase our regulatory compliance costs, and adversely impact the stability of our deposit base. We plan to continue investing in our digital banking platforms while maintaining an appropriately sized branch network. An inability to meet evolving customer expectations for both digital and in-person banking may adversely affect our financial results in the future. 
 Regulatory Environment and Trends 
 We are subject to federal and state regulation and supervision, which continue to evolve as the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations continues to change. The current operating environment includes extensive regulation and supervision in areas such as consumer compliance, the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance, risk management, and internal audit. We anticipate that this environment of extensive regulation and supervision will continue for the industry. As a result, changes in the regulatory environment may result in additional costs for additional compliance, risk management, and audit personnel or professional fees associated with advisors and consultants. 
 
 FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS 
 JOBS Act Accounting Election 
 We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. The Company may remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, which is December 31, 2024, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which the Company has 1.235 billion or more in annual revenues, (3) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act, or (4) the date on which the Company has, during the previous three year period, issued, publicly or privately, more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities. We have elected to use the extended transition period until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we choose to affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies. The Company expects to exit its status as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 18.2 million, decreasing by 1.5 million, or 7.8 , when compared to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Notable changes include the following: 
 A 1.5 million negative mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustment included in the third quarter of 2024 results; 
 Net losses of 0.8 million realized on the sale of debt securities included in the third quarter of 2023 results not present in the third quarter of 2024 results; 
 A 0.7 million increase in salaries expense, primarily driven by annual merit increases; 
 A 0.5 million decrease in net interest income, primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets; and 
 A 0.6 million decrease in income tax expense, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income resulting from the above items. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 51.5 million, increasing by 4.1 million, or 8.7 , when compared to net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Notable changes include the following: 
 There were no Town and Country acquisition-related expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.7 million of acquisition-related expenses incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 
 Net losses of 3.4 million were realized on the sale of debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net losses of 1.8 million realized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023; 
 A 2.5 million decrease in net interest income, primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets; 
 A 1.5 million negative mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustment included in the 2024 results, compared to a 0.5 million negative mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustment included in the 2023 results; and 
 A 2.1 million increase in income tax expense, primarily reflecting higher pre-tax income resulting from the above items as well as an additional 0.5 million for a deferred tax expense write-down, primarily as a result of an Illinois tax change. This increased our effective tax rate to 26.4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.7 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect this write-down to be earned back over several years through reduced tax expense. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income equals the excess of interest income on interest earning assets (including discount accretion on acquired loans plus certain loan fees) over interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, also support interest-earning assets. 
 The following tables set forth average balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information. Average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans are included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees and costs, discounts and premiums, as well as purchase accounting adjustments that are accreted or amortized to interest income or expense.

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Information is provided for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with respect to changes attributable to volume i.e. , changes in average balances multiplied by the prior-period average rate), and changes attributable to rate i.e. , changes in average rate multiplied by prior-period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both volume and rate that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 47.7 million, decreasing 0.5 million, or 1.1 , when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in funding costs which were mostly offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets and an increase in interest-earning assets. 
 Net interest margin decreased to 3.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields. The contribution of acquired loan discount accretion to net interest margin was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, remaining at 10 basis points.

 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 141.4 million, decreasing 2.5 million, or 1.8 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in funding costs which were partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets and higher interest-earning asset balances following the Town and Country merger. 
 Net interest margin decreased to 3.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields. Additionally, the contribution of acquired loan discount accretion to net interest margin increased to 10 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The quarterly net interest margins were as follows: 
 2024 2023 Three months ended: March 31 3.94 4.20 June 30 3.95 4.16 September 30 3.98 4.07 December 31 3.93 
 Our net interest margin decreased modestly beginning in the second quarter of 2023 as increased competition for deposits drove an increase in our funding costs. This continued during the remainder of 2023 with increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields. Our deposit balances and funding costs began to stabilize during the first quarter of 2024. 
 In September 2024, the Federal Open Markets Committee ("FOMC") lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 . This decrease, and potential future decreases, may put downward pressure on our net interest margin, as the negative impact on floating rate loans may not be fully offset by the positive impacts of maturing fixed rate loans and securities repricing at higher rates or potential decreases in deposit costs. Generally, we expect increases in market interest rates will increase our net interest income and net interest margin in future periods, while decreases in market interest rates may decrease our net interest income and net interest margin in future periods; however, this depends upon the timing and extent of interest rate fluctuations and may not always be the case.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The following table sets forth the components of provision for credit losses for the periods indicated:

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 0.5 million provision during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The third quarter of 2024 provision for credit losses primarily reflects a 1.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts; a 0.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from qualitative factor changes; a 0.6 million decrease in required reserves driven by decreased loan balances and changes within the loan portfolio; and a 0.2 million decrease in specific reserves. 
 Additionally, the 2023 results included the reversal of an allowance for credit losses of 0.8 million on debt securities available-for-sale related to one bank subordinated debt security after a merger announcement by the issuer. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The 2024 provision for credit losses primarily reflects a 3.9 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in qualitative factors; a 0.1 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts; a 1.0 million decrease in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans; and a 0.7 million decrease in required reserves driven by changes within the loan portfolio. 
 The 2023 results included the recognition of an allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans of 5.2 million and an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments of 0.7 million through provision for credit losses which were related to the Town and Country acquisition. 
 Additionally, the 2023 results included the establishment of an allowance for credit losses of 0.8 million on debt securities available-for-sale during the first half of 2023, related to one bank subordinated debt security, which was later reversed during the third quarter of 2023 after a merger announcement by the issuer of the bank subordinated debt security. 
 Credit losses are highly dependent on current and forecast economic conditions. Potential deterioration of economic conditions may lead to higher credit losses and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. The economic forecasts utilized in estimating the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending-related unfunded commitments include the unemployment rate and changes in GDP as macroeconomic variables, although other economic metrics are considered on a qualitative basis.

 Income Taxes 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 6.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 25.8 , and 6.9 million, or an effective tax rate of 25.9 , respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 18.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 26.4 , and 16.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 25.7 , respectively. The increase in effective tax rate during 2024 was primarily attributable to an additional 0.5 million of tax expense for a deferred tax asset write-down, recognized during the second quarter of 2024, as a result of an Illinois tax change.

 Notable changes in our consolidated balance sheet include the following: 
 Debt securities decreased 65.5 million, largely due to the sale of 66.8 million of municipal securities with sales proceeds used to reduce wholesale funding. Additionally, paydowns, maturities, and calls of debt securities generated another 85.2 million of cash proceeds with 67.3 million being reinvested into debt securities at currently higher yields; 
 Loans decreased by 34.6 million, driven by lower line of credit utilization and early payoffs of loans; and 
 The 120.7 million decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to a 114.9 million decrease in brokered deposits. Deposit balances continued to shift towards higher cost deposit products, such as time deposits which increased 176.7 million, including the addition of 65.0 million of time deposits from a State of Illinois loan matching program that are a lower cost source of funding.

 A 14.8 million increase in multi-family loans and a 8.5 million increase in commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans primarily attributable to completed construction projects transferred from the construction and land development category, partially offset by early payoffs; and 
 A 4.8 million decrease in construction loans primarily attributable to transfers of completed projects into other categories, partially offset by draws on existing construction projects and new construction loans to existing customers.

 Management s disciplined approach to credit risk management is exercised through portfolio diversification, robust underwriting policies, and routine loan monitoring practices in order to identify and mitigate any credit weakness as early as possible. Management continually monitors and evaluates commercial real estate concentrations by property class, industry, and relative to the Bank s regulatory capital to remain in line with board established limits and adapt to changing industry conditions. A centralized credit underwriting group, independent of the originating lender, evaluates all exposures over 750 thousand annually, if not more frequently, through a standardized credit review process to ensure uniform application of policies and procedures as well as analyze credit performance. All loans require appropriate internal approval, with a centralized credit approval group reviewing all exposures over 500 thousand. A sampling of the loan portfolio is also reviewed by the Bank s internal loan review function annually, in addition to an annual third-party review of the portfolio. 
 In response to the rapid increase in interest rates, we have prepared quarterly cash flow stress tests for our commercial real estate non-owner occupied and multi-family loans since the fourth quarter of 2022. For commercial real estate non-owner occupied and multi-family loans over 1 million, we evaluate the impact of current interest rates on the underlying cash flows of the properties securing these loans, based on the most recent cash flow data available. This testing is completed in addition to the various sensitivity testing completed at the initial extension of credit. Individual credits with a maturity scheduled within the next five quarters that are presenting stress under current renewal terms are identified, so that ample time is available to develop solutions to manage credit risk.

 Total nonperforming assets were 8.6 million at September 30, 2024, remaining relatively stable from December 31, 2023. Additionally, of the 8.2 million of nonperforming loans held as of September 30, 2024, 2.0 million are either wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. Government. 
 
 Risk Classification of Loans 
 Our risk classifications of loans were as follows: 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Pass 3,157,434 3,241,889 Pass-watch 109,743 98,206 Special mention (1) 
 27,632 Substandard 75,021 64,322 Total 3,369,830 3,404,417 
 _________________________________________________ 
 (1) In June 2024, the Company updated its risk rating categories to add the special mention category to provide another level of granularity in distinguishing risk levels of loans. As of June 30, 2024, 19.5 million of the special mention loans would have been considered pass-watch and 10.6 million would have been considered substandard under the previous risk rating categories. 
 Loans rated pass-watch or worse increased 49.9 million, or 30.7 , from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to the downgrade of one construction and land development credit, three non-owner occupied commercial real estate credits, and two farmland-secured credits to the pass-watch risk classification.

 Annualized measure. 
 The net charge-offs (recoveries) to average total loans ratio has remained low for several years. While we believe our continuous credit monitoring and collection efforts have resulted in lower levels of credit losses, we also recognize that substantial federal economic stimulus following the COVID-19 pandemic and the relatively stable economic conditions after the pandemic have also contributed to reduced credit losses. 
 Additionally, heightened net charge-offs within the commercial and industrial segment are primarily related to equipment finance loans which were purchased as part of a pool of loans during 2023.

 Annualized measure. 
 The increase in average deposit balances in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily attributable to wealth management customer reciprocal deposits brought on balance sheet in December 2023, which increased average money market deposits by 128.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and by 134.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Town and Country merger added 720.4 million of deposits on February 1, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 30.0 million of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding which matured and were repaid in October 2024. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others. A traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available. Federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate, thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts.

 LIQUIDITY 
 
 Bank Liquidity 
 The overall objective of bank liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash funds to meet all financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. The Bank manages liquidity in order to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. 
 The Bank continuously monitors its liquidity positions to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of our short-term and long-term cash requirements. The Bank manages its liquidity position to meet our daily cash flow needs, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives. The Bank also monitors liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy, the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits, and regulatory capital requirements. 
 As part of the Bank s liquidity management strategy, the Bank is also focused on minimizing costs of liquidity and attempts to decrease these costs by promoting noninterest-bearing and low-cost deposits. While the Bank does not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, those choices can be influenced with the rates and the deposit specials offered. 
 Our on-balance sheet sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents as well as unpledged securities which may be sold or pledged as collateral to meet liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our on-balance sheet sources of liquidity included the following: 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 179,671 141,252 Fair value of unpledged securities 648,017 827,760 Total cash and unpledged securities 827,688 969,012

Table of Contents 

 Additional sources of liquidity include borrowings from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve discount window, and federal fund lines of credit. Interest is charged on outstanding borrowings at the prevailing market rate. As of September 30, 2024, our current borrowings and additional available borrowing capacity were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands) Current Balance Additional Available Capacity FHLB 13,435 1,019,179 Federal Reserve 104,665 Federal funds lines of credit 80,000 Total 13,435 1,203,844 
 Further, the Bank could utilize brokered deposits as an additional source of liquidity, as needed. 
 As of September 30, 2024, management believed the current liquidity and available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet all of the reasonably foreseeable short-term and intermediate-term demands of the Bank . As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had no material commitments for capital expenditures. 
 
 Holding Company Liquidity 
 The Holding Company, or HBT Financial, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, it must provide for its own liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, the Holding Company had cash and cash equivalents of 17.9 million. 
 The Holding Company s main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to it by the Bank. Dividends paid by the Bank to the Holding Company would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. Management believes that such limitations will not impact the Holding Company s ability to meet its ongoing short-term or intermediate-term cash obligations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank paid 8.0 million and 12.0 million in dividends to the Holding Company, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Bank paid 26.0 million and 52.0 million in dividends to the Holding Company, respectively. 
 The liquidity needs of the Holding Company on an unconsolidated basis consist primarily of operating expenses, interest payments on the subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures, and shareholder distributions in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, holding company operating expenses consisted of interest expense of 1.5 million and 1.4 million, respectively, and other operating expenses of 1.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, holding company operating expenses consisted of interest expense of 4.3 million and 4.0 million, respectively, and other operating expenses of 3.1 million and 4.6 million, respectively. 
 Additionally, the Holding Company paid 6.0 million and 5.4 million of dividends to stockholders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and paid 18.1 million and 16.4 million of dividends to stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Holding Company also paid 38.0 million in cash consideration in the acquisition of Town and Country during the first quarter of 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, management was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Holding Company s liquidity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, management believed the current liquidity and available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet all of the reasonably foreseeable short-term and intermediate-term demands of the Holding Company .

 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The overall objectives of capital management are to ensure the availability of sufficient capital to support loan, deposit and other asset and liability growth opportunities and to maintain capital to absorb unforeseen losses or write-downs that are inherent in the business risks associated with the banking industry. The Company seeks to balance the need for higher capital levels to address such unforeseen risks and the goal to achieve an adequate return on the capital invested by our stockholders. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The Company and Bank are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of the Company and the Bank. 
 In addition to meeting minimum capital requirements, the Company and the Bank must also maintain a capital conservation buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. The capital conservation buffer requirement is 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. As of those dates, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory prompt corrective action provisions. 
 The following table sets forth actual capital ratios of the Company and the Bank as of the dates indicated, as well as the minimum ratios for capital adequacy purposes with the capital conservation buffer, and the minimum ratios to be well capitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions.

 Stock Repurchase Program 
 The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s Board of Directors have authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million of its common stock under its stock repurchase program in effect until January 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 10.6 million remaining under the current stock repurchase authorization. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 As a financial services provider, the Bank routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, unused lines of credit, commitments to sell loans, and interest rate swaps. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process afforded to loans originated by the Bank. For additional information, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that are critical to the portrayal and understanding of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and require management to make assumptions that are difficult, subjective, or complex. These estimates involve judgments, assumptions, and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. In the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending on the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition or materially different results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. Further, changes in accounting standards could impact the Company s critical accounting estimates. The following accounting estimate could be deemed critical: 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses reflects an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. Measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses which is charged to expense. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance for credit losses. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when the Company determines the loan balance to be uncollectible. Cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance for credit losses. 
 Management uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate expected credit losses for all loan categories, except for consumer loans where the weighted average remaining maturity method is utilized. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine which macroeconomic variables are most closely correlated with credit losses, such as the unemployment rate and changes in GDP. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable third party to inform its economic forecasts with a reversion to historical averages for periods beyond a reasonable and supportable forecast period. 
 Nonaccrual loans and loans which do not share risk characteristics with other loans in the pool are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses. 
 The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is estimated in the same manner as the associated loans, adjusted for anticipated funding rate.

 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain financial information determined by methods other than those in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present these non-GAAP financial measures, and accordingly believes that providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison purposes. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for the results determined to be in accordance with GAAP; nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies. See our reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures below. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure Definition How the Measure Provides Useful Information to Investors Adjusted Net Income Net income, with the following adjustments: 
 - excludes acquisition expenses, including the day 2 provision for credit losses on non-PCD loans and unfunded commitments, 
 - excludes branch closure expenses, 
 - excludes net earnings (losses) from closed or sold operations, 
 - excludes gains (losses) on closed branch premises, 
 - excludes realized gains (losses) on sales of securities, 
 - excludes mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustment, and 
 - the income tax effect of these pre-tax adjustments. 
 Enhances comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. 
 We also sometimes refer to ratios that include Adjusted Net Income, such as: 
 - Adjusted Return on Average Assets, which is Adjusted Net Income divided by average assets. 
 - Adjusted Return on Average Equity, which is Adjusted Net Income divided by average equity. 
 - Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic, which is Adjusted Net Income allocated to common shares divided by weighted average common shares outstanding. 
 - Adjusted Earnings Per Share Diluted, which is Adjusted Net Income allocated to common shares divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, including all dilutive potential shares. 
 Net Interest Income (Tax-Equivalent Basis) Net interest income adjusted for the tax-favored status of tax-exempt loans and securities. (1) 
 We believe the tax-equivalent basis is the preferred industry measurement of net interest income. 
 Enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
 We also sometimes refer to Net Interest Margin (Tax-Equivalent Basis), which is Net Interest Income (Tax-Equivalent Basis) divided by average interest-earning assets. 
 Efficiency Ratio (Tax-Equivalent Basis) Noninterest expense less amortization of intangible assets divided by the sum of net interest income (tax-equivalent basis) and noninterest income. (1) 
 Provides a measure of productivity in the banking industry. 
 Calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk inherent in the normal course of lending and deposit-taking activities. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Management believes that our ability to successfully respond to changes in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial results. To that end, management actively monitors and manages our interest rate exposure. 
 The Company s Asset/Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which is authorized by the Company s board of directors, monitors our interest rate sensitivity and makes decisions relating to that process. The ALCO s goal is to structure our asset/liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital in either a rising or declining interest rate environment. Profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. 
 We monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and economic value of equity EVE using rate shock analysis. Net interest income simulations measure the short-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest in a rigorous and explicit fashion. Our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios. EVE measures our long-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. EVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time. A decrease in EVE due to a specified rate change indicates a decline in the long-term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet. 
 The base and shock scenarios in the rate shock analysis assume a static balance sheet, static interest rates, no changes to product mix shift, and cash flow reinvestment at current market interest rates. We also make assumptions for our deposit betas and asset prepayments, based on historical experience. 
 Deposit Betas 
 Deposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the Federal Funds rate, with the relationship between deposit rates and Federal Funds rate defined as deposit beta. We define cumulative deposit beta as the change in our quarterly cost of deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the stated Federal Funds rate range from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the second quarter of 2024, the most recent rising rate cycle. During this period, our cumulative deposit beta was 23.6 . 
 Asset Prepayments 
 We include prepayment assumptions for both our loan and securities portfolios, based on historical experience. Generally, mortgage portfolio prepayments increase in lower rate environments, while commercial and consumer portfolios have historically remained more consistent throughout rate cycles. 
 95 

Table of Contents 

 The following table sets forth the estimated impact on our EVE and net interest income of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates at the specified levels. 
 Change in Interest Rates (basis points) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE Increase (Decrease) in Estimated Net Interest Income Year 1 Year 2 September 30, 2024 +400 23.0 6.0 12.5 +300 19.2 4.8 9.8 +200 14.1 3.9 7.3 +100 7.8 2.5 4.4 -100 (10.0) (4.4) (6.4) -200 (16.3) (6.2) (10.8) -300 (8.9) (6.7) (13.8) -400 (2.8) (7.6) (15.6) December 31, 2023 +400 10.7 7.5 13.0 +300 9.7 5.8 10.3 +200 7.1 3.4 6.4 +100 4.2 1.4 3.1 -100 (6.3) (4.4) (6.1) -200 (13.2) (7.1) (11.2) -300 (4.5) (9.5) (16.0) -400 5.4 (10.2) (17.3) 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE and net interest income requires that we make certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The EVE and net interest income table presented above assumes that the composition of our interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and, accordingly, the data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors, which could change the actual impact on EVE and net interest income. The table also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE and net interest income table provides an indication of our sensitivity to interest rate changes at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Our loan policy documents underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the borrower, industry, and product levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management also includes an independent loan review process that assesses compliance with loan policy, compliance with loan documentation standards, accuracy of the risk rating and overall credit quality of the loan portfolio.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Company s senior management. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
