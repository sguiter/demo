NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 and 2023 

 (unaudited) 

and used approximately of cash in operating
activities. 

On
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and restricted cash of approximately . Restricted cash represents amounts pledged
as collateral for financing arrangements that are currently limited to the issuance of business credit cards. The restriction will end
upon the conclusion of these financing arrangements. We believe that our current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations
beyond the next 12 months. This estimate is based, in part, upon our currently projected expenditures. 

The
Company s activities since inception have principally consisted of acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital, and
performing research and development. Successful completion of the Company s development programs, obtaining regulatory approvals
of its products and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations is dependent on future events, including, among other things,
its ability to access potential markets, secure financing, develop a customer base, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel,
and develop strategic alliances. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has primarily funded its operations through equity offerings. 

The
Company will need to continue obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. The Company can give no
assurances that the additional capital it is able to raise, if any, will be sufficient to meet its needs, or that any such financing
will be obtainable on acceptable terms. Our future cash requirements, and the timing of those requirements, will depend on a number of
factors, including economic conditions, the approval and success of our products in development, the continued progress of research and
development of our product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing,
filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive
products, the availability of financing, our success in developing markets for our product candidates and legal proceedings that may
arise. We have historically not generated sustained positive cash flow and if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed,
we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs. If the
Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail its drug development activities.
The Company expects to continue incurring substantial operating losses and negative cash flows from operations over the next several
years during its pre-clinical and clinical development phases. 

segment. Management uses cash flows as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its
business for internal reporting or decision-making. 

for each institution where accounts are held. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our primary operating accounts held
approximately 
and ,
respectively, and our restricted cash collateral account balance was 
and at a
different institution. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant
risks thereof. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, tax receivable,
other assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The carrying values
of leases payable approximate their fair values due to the fact that the interest rates on these obligations are based on prevailing
market interest rates. 

,
which was received in full as of September 30, 2024. The Company estimated and accrued Refundable Tax Credits for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 
and a tax payable of , resulting in a net balance of Refundable Tax Credits receivable of approximately . 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company assessed its income tax expense based on its projected future taxable income for the year ending December
31, 2024 and therefore recorded amount for income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company
has significant deferred tax assets available to offset income tax expense due to net operating loss carry forwards which are currently
subject to a full valuation allowance based on the Company s assessment of future taxable income. Refer to our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information.

ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation. , and under the recently issued guidance following FASB s pronouncement,
ASU 2018-07, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
Under ASC 718, and applicable updates adopted, share-based awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair value
is recognized over the requisite service, or vesting, period. The Company values its equity awards using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, and accounts for forfeitures when they occur. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
equity-based compensation expense recorded on vested options and RSU was 
and 
and and
 
respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 
 of total unrecognized compensation expense related
to non-vested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
 years. For options granted and outstanding, there
were 
 options outstanding which were fully vested or

These options had a weighted average exercise price of 
 per share and a weighted-average remaining contractual
term of

Company s common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Capital Market on September 30, 2024 of per share less the exercise price
of the options. The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the positive difference between the closing fair market value of
the Company s common stock and the exercise price of the underlying options.

December 15, 2023, the Company received written notice from Merck of Merck s election to terminate the Collaboration Agreement.
The termination of the Collaboration Agreement took effect on March 14, 2024. According to Merck s termination notice, Merck determined
there were no existing conditions to continue the collaboration. The termination resulted from the inability to develop the compounds

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

Cocrystal
Pharma, Inc. (the Company or Cocrystal is a clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to discover and
develop novel antiviral therapeutics as treatments for serious and/or chronic viral diseases. We employ unique structure-based technologies
and Nobel Prize winning expertise to create first- and best-in-class antiviral drugs. These technologies are designed to efficiently
deliver small molecule therapeutics that are safe, effective and convenient to administer. We have identified promising preclinical and
clinical-stage antiviral compounds for unmet medical needs including influenza virus, coronavirus, norovirus and hepatitis C virus HCV ). 

Research
and Development Update 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company continued to focus its research and development efforts primarily in three areas. 

Influenza
Program 

We
have several candidates under development for the treatment of influenza infection. CC-42344, a novel PB2 inhibitor, was selected as
a preclinical lead as an oral or inhaled treatment of pandemic and seasonal influenza A. This candidate binds to a highly conserved PB2
site of influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA) and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 showed excellent in vitro 
antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu and Xofluza resistant strains,
and has favorable pharmacokinetic and drug resistance profiles. Oral CC-42344 is being evaluated in a Phase 2a human challenge study.
In addition, the inhaled CC-42344 is being developed for the potential prophylactic treatment of pandemic and seasonal influenza infections.
Dry powder inhalation development and toxicology studies have been evaluated. 

We
received authorization from the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to conduct a Phase 2a human
challenge study with oral CC-42344 as a potential treatment for pandemic and seasonal influenza A. This ongoing randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, viral and clinical measurements of influenza A infection in subjects
dosed with oral CC-42344 treatment. In May 2024 we announced completion of enrollment of 77 subjects. 

In
June 2024 we reported the potential efficacy of CC-42344 against the new Texas avian flu strain from in vitro studies with the
recently published genome sequence for H5N1. Using our proprietary structure-based platform technology, the Company reported a high-resolution
cocrystal structure of this avian PB2 protein complexed with CC-42344 and confirmed that CC-42344 binds to its highly conserved PB2 region.
The in vitro data using purified Texas avian H5N1 PB2 protein further showed in vitro affinity of CC-42344similar to that of the
previously data using pandemic avian and seasonal influenza A PB proteins. We also continue developing novel broad-spectrum influenza
antivirals targeting replication enzymes of seasonal and pandemic influenza A and B strains.

developed the novel protease inhibitor CDI-988 as an oral pan-viral treatment of noroviruses and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2
and its variants. CDI-988 was specifically designed and developed using our proprietary structure-based drug discovery platform technology
as a broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitor to a highly conserved region in the active site of noroviruses, coronaviruses and other 3CL viral
proteases. We believe CDI-988 represents a first-in-class pan-viral antiviral for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis and COVID-19
caused by noroviruses and coronaviruses, respectively. 

Oral
CDI-988 is being clinically evaluated for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics including a food-effect cohort in healthy volunteers
in a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study being conducted in Australia. 

We
previously announced favorable safety and tolerability results from the single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts of the Phase 1 study with
CDI-988 in July 2024. Study participants in the SAD cohorts received CDI-988 in doses ranging from 100 mg to 600 mg. All participants
completed the study with no discontinuations. There were no serious adverse events or severe treatment-emergent adverse events. No clinically
significant observations were noted in laboratory assessments, physical exams or electrocardiograms. 

In
September 2024 we initiated dosing of the first subjects in the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion of the Phase 1 study with CDI-988. 

Therapeutic
Targets 

Influenza:
A worldwide public health problem, including the potential for pandemic disease. 

Influenza
is a severe respiratory illness, caused primarily by influenza A or B virus. Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known
to cause influenza pandemics. Each year there are approximately 1 billion cases of seasonal influenza worldwide, with 3-5 million severe
illnesses and up to 650,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization WHO ). On average about 8 of the U.S. population
contracts influenza each season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC ). In addition to the
health risk, influenza is responsible for approximately 10.4 billion in direct medical costs in the U.S. annually, according to the
National Institutes of Health NIH ). 

Currently
approved antiviral treatments for influenza are effective but burdened with significant viral resistance. Strains of influenza virus
that are resistant to the approved treatments oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu ), zanamavir (Relenza and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza have appeared and in some cases are predominant. For example, the predominant strain of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic was resistant
to oseltamivir. Oseltamivir inhibits influenza neuraminidase enzymes, which are not highly conserved between viral strains. According
to the WHO, approximately 15 of the H1N1 isolates circulating worldwide were oseltamivir resistant. Also, treatment-emergent resistance
to recently approved baloxavir has been observed during clinical trials and the potential transmission of resistant influenza variants
could significantly diminish baloxavir effectiveness. 

Coronavirus:
COVID-19 continues to be a global pandemic fueled by an emergence of new strains. 

COVID-19
is a global pandemic with approximately 777 million confirmed cases globally, including 7 million deaths, as of October 2024,
according to data reported by the WHO. 

Coronaviruses
(CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that historically have been associated with illness ranging from mild symptoms similar to the
common cold to more severe respiratory disease. Infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a wide range of responses,
from no symptoms to more severe disease that has included pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. The
incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be within 14 days after exposure, with most illness occurring within about five days
after exposure. SARS-CoV-2, like other RNA viruses, is prone to mutate over time, resulting in the emergence of multiple variants. Adaptive
mutations in the viral genome can alter the virus s pathogenic potential. Even a single amino acid exchange can drastically affect
a virus s ability to evade the immune system and complicate the vaccine and antibody therapeutics development against the virus.
Based on the recent epidemiological update by the WHO, five SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (variants of concern) have been identified since the beginning
of the pandemic. Also, as demonstrated in the Delta, Omicron and other variants, some variations allow the virus to spread more easily
and make it resistant to the treatments and vaccines. 

4 

On
October 22, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) for
the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that inhibits viral replication and was previously
evaluated in clinical trials for Ebola treatment in 2014. On May 25, 2023, the FDA approved Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets and
ritonavir tablets, co-packaged for oral use) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression
to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. For certain hospitalized adults with COVID-19, the FDA has also approved Olumiant 
(baricitinib) and Actemra (tocilizumab). In addition, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for several antibody and
antiviral therapeutics, including and Lagevrio (molnupiravir). 

We
continue pursuing the development of novel antiviral compounds for the treatment of coronavirus infections using our established proprietary
drug discovery platform. By targeting the viral replication enzymes and protease, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment
for all coronavirus diseases including COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 

Norovirus:
A worldwide public health problem responsible for close to 90 of epidemic, non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world
with no effective treatment. 

Norovirus
is a very common and highly contagious virus that causes symptoms of acute gastroenteritis among people of all ages. Norovirus infection
can be significantly more severe and prolonged in specific risk groups including infants, children, the elderly and people with immunodeficiency.
In immunosuppressed patients, chronic norovirus infection can lead to a debilitating illness with extended periods of nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea as well as fatigue, fever and dehydration. Norovirus outbreaks
occur most commonly in semi-closed communities and have become notorious for their occurrence in hospitals, nursing homes, childcare
facilities, cruise ships, schools, disaster relief sites and military settings. In the U.S. alone, noroviruses are responsible for an
estimated 21 million cases annually, including 109,000 hospitalizations, 465,000 emergency department visits and nearly 900 deaths, according
to the CDC. The NIH estimates the annual burden to the United States at 10.6 billion. Noroviruses are responsible for up to 1.1 million
hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths annually in children in the developing world. 

There
is currently no effective treatment or effective vaccine for norovirus, and the ability to curtail outbreaks is limited. We are
developing a novel norovirus antiviral candidate for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of norovirus infection that is
currently in a Phase 1 clinical study. A few companies have been developing vaccines and are in stages of clinical testing,
including Vaxart Pharmaceutical, Moderna, Hillevax, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical (China) and
National Vaccine and Serum Institute (China). 

By
targeting viral replication enzymes and a viral protease, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all genogroups
of norovirus. Also, because of the significant unmet medical need and the possibility of chronic norovirus infection in immunocompromised
individuals, new antiviral therapeutic and prophylactic approaches may warrant an accelerated path to market. We are developing inhibitors
of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and protease of norovirus. These enzymes are essential to viral replication and are highly conserved
between all noroviral genogroups. Therefore, an inhibitor of these enzymes might be an effective treatment or short-term prophylactic
agent, when administered during a cruise or nursing home stay, for example. We have developed X-ray quality norovirus polymerase and
protease crystals and have identified promising inhibitors. We are implementing our proprietary drug discovery platform technology and
approaches that have proven successful in our other antiviral programs. 

Hepatitis
C: A large competitive market with opportunity for shorter treatment regimens. 

HCV
is a highly competitive and changing market. Since 2014, several combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents DAAs have been approved for the treatment of HCV infection. These include Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Viekira
Pak (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Epclusa (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) 12 weeks of treatment,
Zepatier (elbasvir/grazoprevir) 12 weeks of treatment and Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) eight weeks of treatment. We
believe the next improvements in HCV treatment will be ultra-short combination oral treatments of four to six weeks, which is the goal
of our program. 

5 

We
anticipate a significant global HCV market opportunity that will persist through at least 2036, given the large prevalence of HCV infection
worldwide. The 2024 World Health Organization Global Hepatitis Report estimates that 50 million people worldwide have chronic HCV infections
with about 1 million new infections occurring per year and an estimated 3.2 million adolescents and children with chronic HCV infection. 

We
are targeting the viral NS5B polymerase with a non-nucleoside inhibitor NNI ), which could be developed as part of an all-oral,
pan-genotypic combination regimen. Our focus is on developing what is now called ultrashort treatment regimens from four to six weeks
in length. Combining CC-31244 with different classes of approved direct-acting antivirals DAAs has the potential to change
the paradigm of treatment for HCV by shortening the duration of treatment. Combination strategies with approved drugs could allow us
to expand CC-31244 into the HCV antiviral therapeutic area globally and could lead to a high and fast cure rate, to improved compliance,
and to reduced treatment duration. To our knowledge no competing company has yet developed a short HCV treatment of less than 8 weeks
with a high (>95 sustained virologic response (SVR) at week 12. 

CC-31244,
an HCV NNI, is a potential best in class pan-genotypic inhibitor of NS5B polymerase for the treatment of HCV. We completed a randomized,
double-blinded Phase 1a/b study in healthy volunteers and HCV-infected subjects in Canada in September 2016, with favorable safety results.
We completed a Phase 2a study in HCV genotype 1 subjects in the U.S. in 2017. HCV-infected subjects treated with CC-31244 had a rapid
and marked decline in HCV RNA levels, and slow viral rebound after treatment. Results of this study suggest that CC-31244 could be an
important component in a shortened duration all-oral HCV combination therapy. We have completed the Phase 2a final study report as filed
with the FDA. See Item 1 Business Research and Development Update Hepatitis C in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information. 

We
have been seeking a partner for further clinical development of CC-31244 since completing Phase 2a trials. 

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2023 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development expense consists primarily of compensation-related costs for our employees dedicated to research and development activities
and clinical trials, as well as lab supplies, lab services, and facilities and equipment costs related to our research and development
programs. 

Total
research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 3,242,000 and 4,194,000, respectively.
The decrease of 952,000 was primarily due to our Influenza CC-42344 product candidate moving out of Phase 2a clinical trial and the
finalizing of the Phase 1 clinical trial of norovirus and coronavirus candidate CDI-988. 

Total
research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 10,500,000 and 10,902,000, respectively.
The decrease of 402,000 was primarily due to a decrease in preclinical trial costs of 1.7 million and manufacturing development costs
of 1.2 million, partially offset with an increase of 2.5 million related to CC-42344 Phase 2a clinical study costs. 

General
and Administrative Expense 

General
and administrative expenses include compensation-related costs for our employees dedicated to general and administrative activities,
legal fees, audit and tax fees, consultants and professional services, and general corporate expenses. 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 1,800,000 and 1,849,000, respectively, remaining
relatively stable between periods. 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4,148,000 and 4,591,000, respectively. The decrease
of 443,000 was primarily due to reduction of legal litigation fees, insurance cost and other general and administrative expenses. 

6 

Legal
settlement 

The
Company paid 1.6 million into the registry of the court in 2022 that was expensed as legal settlement. Following a favorable appeal
ruling, the Company received a refund of the 1.6 million from the registry of the court during the period ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
Income, Net 

Interest
income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 111,000 and 320,000, respectively, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 482,000 and 460,000, respectively. The interest income was primarily earned on cash held in interest
bearing bank accounts. 

Foreign
Exchange Loss 

In
2022, the Company established a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia, making it subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign
exchange loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 72,000 and 87,000, respectively. 

Income
Taxes 

No
income tax benefit or expense was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company s effective
income tax rate was 0.00 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As a result of the Company s cumulative
losses, management has concluded that a full valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets is appropriate. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the above factors, net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,939,000 and 14,238,000, respectively,
compared with a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 4,165,000 and 13,520,000, respectively, as a result
of developments related to our expenses described above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 13,325,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash used in operating
activities of 11,340,000 for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily related to period expenses of our Influenza A Phase
2a clinical trial and preparation for our anticipated Influenza A Phase 1 inhaler administer medicine clinical trial and completion of
our COVID-19 Phase 1 clinical trial. 

We
used 8,000 net cash for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 59,000 net cash used for
the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the level of investments decreased compared with September 30,
2023 due to comparative reduction in purchases of laboratory equipment in 2024. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash provided by financing
activities of 3,993,000 for the same period in 2023. 

The
Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. The Company had 13,020,000 unrestricted
cash on September 30, 2024. The Company believes it has sufficient cash to maintain planned operations for more than the next 12 months. 

We
have focused our efforts on research and development activities, including through collaborations with suitable partners. We have been
profitable on a quarterly basis but have never been profitable on an annual basis. We have no products approved for sale and have incurred
operating losses and negative operating cash flows on an annual basis since inception. 

The
Company s interim consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. Historically, public and private equity offerings have been our principal source of liquidity. 

7 

The
Company is party to the At-The-Market Offering Agreement, dated July 1, 2020 ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright 
Co., LLC Wainwright ), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell over time and from time to time, to or through
Wainwright, up to 10,000,000 of shares of the Company s common stock. There were no sales under the ATM Agreement during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

As
the Company continues to incur losses, achieving profitability is dependent upon the successful development, approval and commercialization
of its product candidates, and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the Company s cost structure. The Company may
never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional capital. Management
intends to fund future operations through additional private or public equity offerings and through arrangements with strategic partners
or from other sources. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to the Company,
or at all, and any equity financing may be very dilutive to existing stockholders.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

In
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates upon
which our financial statements are derived. 

Accounting
estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 

Readers
are encouraged to review these disclosures in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in
conjunction with the review of this report. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect, or are reasonably
likely to affect, our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

9.
The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon shareholders herein are granted subject to this reservation. 

10.
No director of this Company shall be personally liable to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director. Nothing in this paragraph shall serve to eliminate or limit the liability of a director (a) for any breach of the
director s duty of loyalty to this Company or its shareholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involves intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (d) for any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the shareholders
of this article to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability
of a director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law,
as so amended. 

Any
repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the shareholders of the Company shall not adversely affect any right or protection
of a director of the Company existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 

11.
(a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding
(except as provided in Section 11 (f)) whether civil, criminal or administrative, (a Proceeding ), or is contacted by any
governmental or regulatory body in connection with any investigation or inquiry (an Investigation ), by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or executive officer (as such term is utilized pursuant to interpretations under Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans (an Indemnitee ), whether the basis of such Proceeding or Investigation is alleged action in an official capacity
or in any other capacity as set forth above shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to the fullest extent authorized by
the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to
the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Company to provide
prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes
or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification
shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
Indemnitee s heirs, executors and administrators. The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right
and shall include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition (an Advancement of Expenses ); provided , however , that an Advancement of Expenses shall be made
only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such Indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise (an Undertaking ). 

(b)
If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Section is not paid in full by the Company within 60 days after a written claim has been received
by the Company, except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the
Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole
or in part in any such suit or in a suit brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking,
the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In 

(i)
any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce
a right to an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and 

2 

(ii)
any suit by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking the Company shall be entitled to
recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee
has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Company
(including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its board of directors,
independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right hereunder,
or by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified or to such Advancement of Expenses under this Section or otherwise shall be on the Company. 

(c)
The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, this certificate of incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

(d)
The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation
Law. 

(e)
The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the Advancement
of Expenses, to any employee or agent of the Company to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Section with respect to the indemnification
and Advancement of Expenses of directors, and executive officers of the Company. 

(f)
Notwithstanding the indemnification provided for by this Section 11, the Company s bylaws, or any written agreement, such indemnity
shall not include any Advancement of Expenses incurred by such Indemnitees relating to or arising from any Proceeding in which the Company
asserts a direct claim against an Indemnitee, or an Indemnitee asserts a direct claim against the Company, whether such claim is termed
a complaint, counterclaim, crossclaim, third-party complaint or otherwise. Following the termination of any Proceeding referred to in
this Section 11(f), the Company may provide indemnification in accordance with this Section 11, the Company s bylaws, any written
agreement or the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

12.
This Certificate of Incorporation and the internal affairs of the Company shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the
State of Delaware, excluding its conflict of laws principles. Unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer (or
affiliate of any of the foregoing) of the Company to the Company or the Company s shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim
arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws,
or (iv) any other action asserting a claim arising under, in connection with, and governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 

I,
THE UNDERSIGNED, being the incorporator hereinbefore named, for the purpose of forming a corporation pursuant to the Delaware General
Corporation Law, do make this certificate, hereby declaring and certifying that this is my act and deed and the facts herein stated are
true, and accordingly have hereunto set my hand this 21st day of November, 2014.
