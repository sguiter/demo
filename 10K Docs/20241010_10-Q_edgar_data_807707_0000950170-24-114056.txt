The Company recognized a gain in the amount of on the sale of the Disposal Group for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 within Other income (expense) on the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) . During September 2024, the Company received payments totaling toward the total balance due from Established. The remaining balance due of is expected to be received during the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. The proceeds of the sale will be used by the Company to repay outstanding debt. The sale of the Disposal Group has been recorded as a sale of a business pursuant to ASC 805 - Business Combinations, but did not meet the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205 - Presentation of Financial Statements, as the sale did not materially affect the Company's operations and did not represent a strategic shift for the Company. At closing, the Company and Established entered into an operations services agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to continue to operate the accessories business for the Buyer's benefit, consisting of certain defined services, including purchasing, logistics, sales, MIS, human resources, customer service, credit and collections, and finance and accounting services. The operating services agreement will continue for a period of twelve months, and may be canceled at any time, or extended, at the Buyer's option.

 of the joint venture and has an voting interest and Sharp owns of the joint venture and has a voting interest. The joint venture agreement between PAC and Sharp contains a put/call option, whereby Sharp has the right to put its interest in the joint venture back to Voxx and Voxx has the right to call Sharp s ownership interest in the joint venture at any time after the approval of Onkyo s annual financial statements for the year ending February 28, 2025 at a purchase price equal to the higher of (a) the assets of Onkyo minus the liabilities of Onkyo, or (b) five times the EBITDA of Onkyo, in either case (a) or (b), less any amounts distributed to Sharp at any time (provided all shareholder loans are repaid) multiplied by the percentage of votes attached to such shares and other interests, free from all encumbrances, and with the benefit of all rights attaching to them as at the date of the relevant notice. The Company has consolidated the financial results of Onkyo since the acquisition date for financial reporting purposes. The non-controlling interest has been classified as redeemable non-controlling interest outside of equity on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as the exercise of the put/call option is not within the Company s control. The carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest of Onkyo cannot be less than the redemption amount, which is the amount Sharp will settle the put option for if exercised. Based upon the terms of the put/call option, the option remains exercisable in the event there is no redemption price, or if the redemption price is a negative amount, as determined by the redemption formula. In periods where the specific formula results in a negative amount, and thus no redemption value exists, no amounts would be paid to or received from the counterparty upon the exercise of the option. Adjustments to reconcile the carrying value to the redemption amount are recorded immediately to retained earnings and included in earnings per share. No adjustment was made to the carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interest at August 31, 2024 as the excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount was minimal, or a negative amount. In the event the formulaic redemption price is positive and greater than the carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interest balance, an adjustment to the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest would be recorded.)

Derivatives designated for hedging 

The carrying value of our other financial instruments did not differ materially from their estimated fair values at August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024. Derivative Instruments The Company s derivative instruments include an interest rate swap agreement and foreign currency contracts. The Company s interest rate swap agreement hedges interest rate exposure related to the outstanding balance of its Florida Industrial Revenue Bonds ("the Florida Mortgage"), with monthly payments due through March 2026. The swap agreement locks the interest rate on the debt at (inclusive of credit spread) through the maturity date of the loan. Interest rate swap agreements qualifying for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges and valued based on a comparison of the change in fair value of the actual swap contracts designated as the hedging instruments and the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap contract (Level 2). We calculate the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement quarterly based on the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are classified in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the instruments at the end of the period. The current outstanding notional value of the Company's interest rate swap at August 31, 2024 is (see Note 27). Foreign currency contracts are utilized by our German subsidiary to hedge a portion of their U.S. Dollar company s inventory purchases when management views them to be advantageous. The valuation of our foreign currency options is performed based on foreign exchange rates and yield curves built from observable market parameters and, where applicable, on Black Scholes or local volatility models calibrated to available volatility quotes (Level 2). During Fiscal 2024 and during the three months ended August 31, 2024 , the Company entered into forward foreign currency contracts 

 11 

at August 31, 2024, and that have been designated as cash flow hedges. The remaining maturities of these option contracts are eighteen months in the aggregate. During the six months ended August 31, 2023, the Company had no open forward foreign currency contracts. Financial Statement Classification

Cash Flow Hedges The change in the fair value of hedging derivative instruments that are expected to be highly effective and have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded to Other comprehensive loss (income). During the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings, the amounts recorded in Other comprehensive loss (income) are reclassified to earnings and presented in the same income statement line item as the effect of the hedged item. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and have not been designated as cash flow hedges are included in other (expense) income on the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) immediately. The gain or loss on the Company s interest rate swap is recorded in Other comprehensive loss (income) and subsequently reclassified into Interest and bank charges in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of August 31, 2024 , interest rate swaps originally designated for hedge accounting were de-designated or terminated. The net income (loss) recognized in Other comprehensive (loss) income for foreign currency contracts is expected to be recognized in Cost of sales during the next twenty-four months. amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the respective periods.

. Through March 1, 2019, interest on the outstanding principal of the loan accrued at . From March 1, 2019 forward, interest accrues at . The amended and restated promissory note is due on February 28, 2025. The outstanding principal balance of this promissory note is convertible at the sole option of Voxx into units of EyeLock LLC. If Voxx chooses not to convert into equity, the outstanding loan principal of the amended and restated promissory note will be repaid at a multiple of based on the repayment date. The agreement includes customary events of default and is collateralized by all of the property of EyeLock LLC. We determined that we hold a variable interest in EyeLock LLC as a result of: our majority voting interest and ownership of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the entity; and 

 the loan agreement with EyeLock LLC, which has a total outstanding balance of as of August 31, 2024. 

 We concluded that we became the primary beneficiary of EyeLock LLC on September 1, 2015 in conjunction with the acquisition. This was the first date on which we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity because we acquired a majority interest in substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of EyeLock, Inc. and EyeLock Corporation on this date, as well as obtained a majority voting interest as a result of this transaction. Although we are considered to have control over EyeLock LLC under ASC 810, due to our majority ownership interest, the assets of EyeLock LLC can only be used to satisfy the obligations of EyeLock LLC. As a result of our majority ownership interest in the entity and our primary beneficiary conclusion, we consolidated EyeLock LLC within our consolidated financial statements beginning on September 1, 2015. On April 29, 2021, EyeLock LLC entered into a exclusive distribution agreement (the Distribution Agreement with GalvanEyes LLC GalvanEyes ), a Florida LLC managed by Beat Kahli, the Vice Chairman of Voxx's Board of Directors. The Distribution Agreement provided that GalvanEyes would be the exclusive distributor of EyeLock products in the European Union, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, Malaysia, and Singapore, with the exception of any existing customer relationships prior to the Distribution Agreement date. The Distribution Agreement also included a put/call arrangement, whereby GalvanEyes had the right to put the exclusivity back to EyeLock after the initial period for a interest in EyeLock. In turn, EyeLock had the ability to call the exclusivity during the term of the Distribution Agreement, based on the occurrence of certain events, which would result in a equity interest given to GalvanEyes. Under the Distribution Agreement, in addition to paying for any products purchased, GalvanEyes agreed to pay EyeLock in the form of an annual fee, over a period, of up to per year, with payments on a quarterly basis beginning on September 1, 2021. As of February 29, 2024, q uarterly installment payments due from GalvanEyes under the Distribution Agreement were past due and totaled . A promissory note was signed by GalvanEyes on March 1, 2024 for the repayment of the remaining quarterly installments payable. The balance will be paid in installments beginning May 31, 2024 and ending on February 28, 2026 with interest accruing at a rate of . The balance due under the promissory note at August 31, 2024 , including accrued interest, totaled . A payment was received for the second quarterly promissory note installment in the amount of on September 3, 2024. On March 1, 2024, EyeLock LLC entered into a joint venture agreement (the "JV Agreement") with GalvanEyes to engage in a newly formed entity, BioCenturion LLC, to operate a biometrics business (see Note 13). EyeLock contributed assets, including all of its inventory and intangible assets, to the joint venture. Beat Kahli will serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of BioCenturion LLC. Simultaneously with the formation of the joint venture and execution of the JV Agreement, the Distribution Agreement was terminated. The put option established by the Distribution Agreement was canceled and the liability of on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at February 29, 2024, representing the prepayment made by GalvanEyes of a interest in EyeLock upon exercise of the put option, was reclassified to Additional paid in capital and Non-controlling interest in proportion to the Company's ownership interest in EyeLock. The balance due on the promissory note receivable from GalvanEyes was also reclassified to Additional paid in capital, representing a contra-equity balance until the note is repaid. The Company has concluded that BioCenturion is a variable interest entity for which EyeLock lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture's economic performance. As EyeLock is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the variable interest entity.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q would constitute forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, information relating to the future performance and financial condition of the Company, the impact of certain macroeconomic events on our results of operations, the plans and objectives of the Company s management, and the Company s assumptions regarding such performance and plans that are forward-looking in nature and involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking information and could be exacerbated by supply chain issues and chip shortages, increasing interest rates, and any deterioration of the global business and economic environment as a result of these and other factors. 
 We begin Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") with an overview of the business. This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. In the next section, we discuss our results of operations for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three and six months ended August 31, 2023. Next, we present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Voxx for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three and six months ended August 31, 2023, in order to provide a useful and appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. We then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows and discuss our material cash requirements in the sections entitled "Liquidity and Capital Resources." We conclude this MD A with a discussion of "Related Party Transactions" and "Recent Accounting Pronouncements." 
 Unless specifically indicated otherwise, all amounts presented in our MD A below are in thousands, except share and per share data. 
 Business Overview 
 VOXX International Corporation ("Voxx," "We," "Our," "Us," or the "Company") is a leading international manufacturer and distributor in the Automotive Electronics, Consumer Electronics, and Biometrics industries. The Company has widely diversified interests, with more than 30 global brands that it has acquired and grown throughout the years, achieving a powerful international corporate image, and creating a vehicle for each of these respective brands to emerge with its own identity. We conduct our business through sixteen wholly-owned subsidiaries: Audiovox Atlanta Corp., VOXX Electronics Corporation, Voxx Hong Kong Ltd., Voxx Consumer Electronics Hong Kong, Ltd., Audiovox International Corp., Code Systems, Inc., Oehlbach Kabel GmbH ("Oehlbach"), Schwaiger GmbH ("Schwaiger"), Invision Automotive Systems, Inc. ("Invision"), Premium Audio Company LLC ("PAC," which includes Klipsch Group, Inc., 11 Trading Company LLC, Premium Audio Company EMEA B.V., Premium Audio Company France S.A.R.L., Premium Audio Company Germany GmbH, and Premium Audio Company Pty Lt.), Omega Research and Development Technology LLC ("Omega"), Voxx Automotive Corp., Audiovox Websales LLC, VSM-Rostra LLC VSM ), Directed by Voxx LLC, and Directed by Voxx Canada Ltd. (collectively, with Directed by Voxx LLC, DEI ), as well as majority owned subsidiaries, EyeLock LLC ("EyeLock") and Onkyo Technology KK n/k/a Premium Audio Company Technology Center K.K. Onkyo ). We market our products under the Audiovox brand name and other brand names and licensed brands, such as Advent , Avital , CarLink , Clifford , Code-Alarm , Crimestopper , Directed , Heco , Integra , Invision , Jensen , Klipsch , Mac Audio , Magnat , myris , Oehlbach , Omega , Onkyo , Prestige , Python , Rosen , Rostra , Schwaiger , Smart Start , Vehicle Safety Manufacturing , and Viper , as well as private labels through a large domestic and international distribution network. We also function as an OEM ("Original Equipment Manufacturer") supplier to several customers, as well as market a number of products under exclusive distribution agreements, such as SiriusXM satellite radio products. 
 Macroeconomic Factors 
 General economic and political conditions such as recessions; interest rates; fuel prices; inflation; foreign currency fluctuations; international tariffs; social, political, and economic risks; and acts of war or terrorism (including, for example, the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the economic sanctions related thereto, and the conflict between Israel and Palestine) have added uncertainty in timing of customer purchases and supply chain constraints. These headwinds are also negatively impacting our customers' operations and financial performance. As a result, demand for many of our products has declined year over year as our customers are exercising caution and adapting to the current macro-economic headwinds. During Fiscal 2024, supply chain challenges continued to affect the Company's material and shipping costs, resulting in shipping delays, and negatively impacted its gross margins. The Company has, and continues to take actions to mitigate these headwinds, as well 
 34 

as manage the business during a period of sales downturns, including the implementation of price increases and certain supply chain improvements, such as relocating its OEM manufacturing operations to Mexico, entering into a joint venture to operate the biometrics business, and the strategic divestiture of certain assets of the Company in order to streamline operations and focus on improving profitability. The Company also continues to introduce new products across its segments and focus on driving operational improvements, discipline, and efficiencies through cost cutting measures and headcount reductions that were implemented during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025 while the Company navigates these current business challenges and near-term economic uncertainty. 
 As announced on August 27, 2024, coincident with the aforementioned activities, the Company has begun conducting the exploration of strategic alternatives in connection with its ongoing efforts to maximize shareholder value including, among other things, a potential sale of the Company, a sale of segments, operational improvements or other strategic transactions. Per its fiduciary responsibilities and to support its evaluation process, the VOXX board has established a strategic transactions committee which has retained Solomon Partners as financial advisor and Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP as legal advisor. There can be no assurance that this process will result in VOXX pursuing a particular transaction or other strategic outcome. VOXX has not set a timetable for completion of this process, and it does not intend to disclose further developments unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary. 
 The Company continues to focus on cash flow and anticipates having sufficient resources to operate for the coming twelve-month period.

We believe our segments have expanding market opportunities with certain levels of volatility related to domestic and international markets, new car sales, increased competition by manufacturers, private labels, technological advancements, discretionary consumer spending and general economic conditions. All of our products are subject to price fluctuations which could affect the carrying value of inventories and gross margins in the future. Macroeconomic factors, such as fluctuations in interest rates, fuel prices, and foreign currency, as well as inflation have been pressured as a result of factors including supply chain shortages and international wars and conflicts, and have created a challenging demand environment in some of our markets, the duration and severity of which we are unable to predict. 
 Our objective is to continue to grow our business by acquiring new brands, embracing new technologies, expanding product development, and applying this to a continued stream of new products that should increase gross margins and improve operating income. In addition, it is our intention to continue to acquire synergistic companies that would allow us to leverage our overhead, penetrate new markets and expand existing product categories through our business channels. Notwithstanding the above, if the appropriate opportunity arises, the Company will explore the potential divestiture of a product line or business. See also "The Company's Actions to Macroeconomic Factors." 
 Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 The Company did not enter into any acquisition transactions during the six months ended August 31, 2024 or 2023. 
 On August 30, 2024, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, VOXX Accessories Corp. ("VAC"), completed the sale of certain assets of its domestic accessories business ("the Disposal Group"), consisting of intangible assets and inventory, to Talisman Brands Inc., dba Established Inc. Established" or the "Buyer for total consideration of 24,542, net of selling expenses. The Company recognized a gain in the amount of 8,300 on the sale of the Disposal Group for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 (see Note 2). The proceeds from the sale will be used by the Company to repay outstanding debt. 
 36 

On August 15, 2024, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Premium Audio Company, LLC ("PAC"), completed the sale of certain trade names and related inventory, to Jamo Holding Limited and Cinemaster Shanghai Ltd. for total consideration of 3,410. The Company recognized a gain of 2,154 on the sale of these assets for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 (see Note 2). The proceeds from the sale were used by the Company to repay outstanding debt. 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company's subsidiary, EyeLock LLC, contributed certain assets to a newly formed joint venture, BioCenturion LLC. The contribution of these assets represented a disposition of a business (see Note 13). 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported in those financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition; accrued sales incentives; expected credit losses on accounts receivable; inventory valuation; valuation of long-lived assets; valuation and impairment assessment of goodwill, trademarks, and other intangible assets; warranties; recoverability of deferred tax assets; and the reserve for uncertain tax positions at the date of the consolidated financial statements. A summary of the Company's critical accounting policies is identified in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024. 
 Continued negative trends in the business, as well as the narrow differences between fair value and carrying value of the Klipsch and Onkyo reporting units and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, may result in an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in the future. Several factors could result in future impairments, including, but not limited to deterioration in macro-economic conditions (including a recession, continued inflation, rising interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates), changes in customer preferences and trends, increased competition, and deterioration in the performance of our business or product lines. It is possible that the changes in numerous estimates associated with management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, could result in a future impairment charge which may be significant.

Automotive Electronics sales represented 28.5 of our net sales for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 31.2 in the prior year period and decreased 9,036 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended 
 37 

August 31, 2023. The primary driver of this decrease was the decline in sales of OEM rear seat entertainment products of approximately 4,600 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, due to factors including volume reductions in existing customer programs and the termination of one customer program that was in place during the prior year. Sales of OEM remote start products also declined approximately 1,100 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of a temporary halt to one customer program due to software issues, and was offset by higher sales generated from the launch of a new customer program that began in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Satellite radio product sales decreased approximately 900 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as suppliers have kept their inventory lean as a result of consumer spending declines amid current economic concerns, as well as due to the continued decline in demand, as most new vehicles come equipped with this product. Sales of aftermarket rear seat entertainment products declined approximately 800 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of inflated vehicle pricing and high interest rates, which continue to result in lower consumer spending on vehicles. Additionally, sales of both aftermarket security products, including remote start and telematic products, as well as aftermarket safety products, declined approximately 500 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 primarily as a result of decreased consumer spending amid current economic concerns and low vehicle inventory. Finally, the Company has experienced a decrease in sales of collision avoidance products of approximately 300, as some car manufacturers who had previously eliminated these products from their OEM lines have added the products back to their new vehicles, thus negatively impacting sales in the aftermarket. As an offset to these sales declines, OEM safety product sales increased approximately 500 during the three months ended August 31, 2024, due to new product launches during the current year period. 
 Automotive Electronics sales represented 29.4 of our net sales for the six months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 32.7 in the prior year period and decreased 19,763 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023. The primary driver of this decrease was the decline in sales of OEM rear seat entertainment products of approximately 13,500 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, due to factors including volume reductions and temporary halts in existing customer programs, as well as the termination of one customer program that was in place during the prior year. Sales of aftermarket security products, including remote start and telematic products, also declined approximately 1,800 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of decreased consumer spending, as well as due to product delays. Satellite radio product sales decreased approximately 1,600 as suppliers have kept their inventory lean as a result of consumer spending declines amid current economic concerns, as well as due to the continued decline in demand, as most new vehicles come equipped with this product. Sales of aftermarket rear seat entertainment products also declined approximately 1,400 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of inflated vehicle pricing and high interest rates, which continue to result in lower consumer spending on vehicles. Additionally, sales of aftermarket safety products decreased approximately 1,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of low vehicle inventory and a decline in consumer spending. Finally, the Company has experienced a decrease in sales of collision avoidance products of approximately 800, as some car manufacturers who had previously eliminated these products from their OEM lines have added the products back to their new vehicles, thus negatively impacting sales in the aftermarket. As an offset to these sales declines, the Company experienced an increase in sales of OEM remote start products of approximately 800 during the six months ended August 31, 2024, due to the launch of a new customer program that began in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Aftermarket accessories product sales also increased approximately 600 due to new leather seat kit product offerings that began during the first quarter of Fiscal 2025. Finally, OEM safety product sales increased approximately 400 during the six months ended August 31, 2024, due to new product launches during the current year period. 
 Consumer Electronics sales represented 71.4 of our net sales for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 68.7 in the comparable prior year period and decreased 11,986 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The net decrease was a result of several factors, including a decline in European accessory product sales of approximately 8,200. This was primarily a result of a decline in sales of balcony solar power products, with sales of these products normalizing in the current year after launching in the second half of Fiscal 2023, as well as due to fewer concerns over near-term power shortages in Europe. The Company experienced a net decrease in sales of premium home theater speakers, wireless speaker products, and other premium audio products of approximately 1,800 during the three months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to a decrease in close-out sales of older products of approximately 2,700, as the Company sold through much of its older product inventory in the comparable prior year period to prepare for the launch of new product. This decline was offset by sales resulting from the successful launch of new products of approximately 900 during the current year period. Domestic sales of accessory products, including reception, hook-up, and other home accessory products, declined approximately 1,400 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to decreased consumer spending amid current economic concerns. Additionally, domestic sales of premium receiver products decreased approximately 600 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 due to prior year close out sales of Pioneer and Esoteric products, as the Company will no longer sell these brands. Sales of the Company's hearing aid products also declined approximately 500 during the three months ended August 31, 2024 as these products launched during the second quarter of the prior year and sales have normalized in the current year. Finally, in Europe and Asia, the Company experienced a net decrease in sales of premium audio products and receiver 
 38 

products of approximately 400 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, due to lower consumer spending amid economic and geopolitical concerns, as well as an overstock of certain older products, offset by positive sales from the launch of new premium audio products in the current year. As an offset to these declines, sales of domestic wireless speaker products increased approximately 1,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of higher product return rates in the prior year which have improved. The Company expects a continued downward trend in sales within its Consumer Electronics segment for the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year in comparison to prior periods as a result of the August 30, 2024 sale of the domestic accessories business of the Company's Voxx Accessories Corp. subsidiary. 
 Consumer Electronics sales represented 70.6 of our net sales for the six months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 67.1 in the comparable prior year period and decreased 21,398 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023. The net decrease was a result of several factors, including a decline in European accessory product sales of approximately 10,800. This was primarily a result of a decline in sales of balcony solar power products, with sales of these products normalizing in the current year after launching in the second half of Fiscal 2023, as well as due to fewer concerns over near-term power shortages in Europe. Sales of domestic wireless accessory speakers also declined for the six months ended August 31, 2024 by approximately 4,600, which was related to a program with one of the Company's customers that did not repeat in the current year. Sales of domestic accessory products, including reception, hook-up, and other home accessory products, declined approximately 2,900 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to decreased consumer spending amid current economic concerns. Additionally, in Europe and Asia, the Company experienced a net decrease in sales of premium audio and receiver products of approximately 1,900 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, due to lower consumer spending amid economic and geopolitical concerns, as well as an overstock of certain older products, offset by positive sales from the launch of new premium audio products in the current year. Finally, domestic sales of premium receiver products decreased approximately 900 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 due to prior year close out sales of Pioneer and Esoteric products, as the Company will no longer sell these brands. As an offset to these declines, domestic sales of the Company's premium home theater speakers, wireless speaker products, and other premium audio products increased approximately 500, net, during the six months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to the successful launch of new products during the current year period of approximately 6,100, offset by a decrease of approximately 5,600 in close-out sales of older product as the Company sold much of its older product inventory in the prior year. The Company expects a continued downward trend in sales within its Consumer Electronics segment for the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year in comparison to prior periods, primarily as a result of the August 30, 2024 sale of the domestic accessories business of the Company's Voxx Accessories Corp. subsidiary, which contributed approximately 22,000 to sales in the second half of the 2024 fiscal year. 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company's majority owned subsidiary, EyeLock LLC, contributed assets, including inventory and intangible assets, to a newly formed joint venture, BioCenturion LLC, which will operate a Biometrics business. As of and for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company accounted for its investment in BioCenturion LLC as an equity method investment with (loss) income from its equity method investee recorded within Other (Expense) Income on the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Gross margin percentages for the Company have decreased 70 basis points for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and have increased 120 basis points for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three and six months ended August 31, 2023. 
 Gross margins in the Automotive Electronics segment decreased 70 basis points for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and increased 80 basis points for the six months ended August 31, 2024. Margin decreases in this segment during the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 were primarily caused by the decline in sales of some of the Company's higher margin products, such as aftermarket security, aftermarket rear seat entertainment, and collision avoidance products. As an offset to these negative factors, one of the primary drivers of increases in margins within the Automotive Electronics segment during both the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 has been the relocation of the manufacturing of most of the Company's OEM automotive products from Florida to Mexico, which began during the second half of Fiscal 2023 and will be completed during the current fiscal year. The Company has realized improved margins on the sale of these products as a result of the cost savings generated by this move. Additionally, sales of the Company's OEM rear seat entertainment products, which have consistently generated lower than normal margins under its current programs as a result of contractual pricing with customers, coupled with higher supply chain costs, declined for both the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, as did sales of satellite radio products, which also generate low margins for the segment. The sales declines of these products contributed positively to segment margins for both periods. For the six months ended August 31, 2024, sales of higher margin OEM security products also contributed positively to margins, as sales of these products increased as compared to the prior year period. 
 Gross margins in the Consumer Electronics segment decreased 40 basis points for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and increased 180 basis points for the six months ended August 31, 2024. The significant decline in sales of balcony solar power products in the Company's European accessory business during both the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 contributed negatively to the segment's margins in both periods, as did the decline in premium audio sales in Europe and Asia. As an offset to these negative margin impacts, although domestic sales of the Company's premium audio products decreased during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and increased only slightly during the six months ended August 31, 2024 on a net basis, fewer low price, low margin close-out sales of older products during both periods helped to improve margins for the segment as compared to prior year, coupled with sales from the launch of new higher margin products. 
 On March 1, 2024, the Company's majority owned subsidiary, EyeLock LLC, contributed assets, including all of its inventory and intangible assets, to a newly formed joint venture, BioCenturion LLC, which will operate a Biometrics business. As of and 
 40 

for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company accounted for its investment in BioCenturion LLC as an equity method investment with income (loss) from its equity method investee recorded within Other (Expense) Income on the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Total operating expenses have decreased 5,313 and 11,780 for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, as compared with the three and six months ended August 31, 2023. The Company expects a continued downward trend in total operating expenses for the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year in comparison to prior periods as a result of the August 30, 2024 sale of the domestic accessories business of the Company's Voxx Accessories Corp. subsidiary. 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024, selling expenses decreased 2,173. The Company experienced a decline in advertising and web expenses totaling approximately 1,500 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as a result of factors including lower web sales and online traffic, decreased advertising spend related to the Company's hearing aid product following its initial launch in the prior year, and cost containment measures and marketing strategy changes implemented during the current year. Employee salary and related benefit expenses decreased approximately 700 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 due to company-wide headcount reductions and lower bonus accruals resulting from lower Company profitability. Commission expenses also decreased approximately 300 during the three months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of lower sales for the quarter. Offsetting these decreases in selling expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company experienced an increase in payroll tax expenses of approximately 200. During the comparable prior year period, the Company received Employee Reduction Credits related to the COVID-19 pandemic that offset payroll tax expense for the three months ended August 31, 2023, which did not repeat in the current year. 
 For the six months ended August 31, 2024, selling expenses decreased 3,749. The Company experienced a decline in advertising and web expenses totaling approximately 2,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as a result of factors including lower web sales and online traffic, decreased advertising spend related to the Company's hearing aid product following its initial launch in the prior year, and cost containment measures and marketing strategy changes implemented during the current year.

 General and administrative expenses decreased 1,473 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. Salary and related benefit expenses decreased approximately 900 as a result of factors including headcount reductions implemented by the Company beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024; the absence of salaries related to EyeLock LLC employees, as the business was contributed to a joint venture on March 1, 2024; and the absence of Beat Kahli's executive salary during the three months ended August 31, 2024, as he stepped down from his position as President of the 
 41 

Company effective March 1, 2024. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately 400 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 due to certain assets of the Company being fully depreciated as compared to the prior year, including the Company's current enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system. Legal and professional fees also declined approximately 300 during the three months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to the decrease in litigation and consulting fees related to the Seaguard arbitration award that was settled and paid during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, as well as due to cost containment measures. Additionally, occupancy costs decreased approximately 100 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of lower communications charges and cost containment savings. As an offset to these decreases, the Company experienced an increase in taxes and licensing fees of approximately 200 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 related to the implementation of a new ERP system the Company has begun undertaking during the current quarter. Payroll tax expenses also increased approximately 100 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as the Company received Employee Reduction Credits related to the COVID-19 pandemic that offset payroll tax expense during the prior year comparable quarter and did not repeat in the current year. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 4,443 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023. Salary and related benefit expenses decreased approximately 2,300 as a result of factors including headcount reductions implemented by the Company beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024; the absence of salaries related to EyeLock LLC employees, as the business was contributed to a joint venture on March 1, 2024; and the absence of Beat Kahli's executive salary during the six months ended August 31, 2024, as he stepped down from his position as President of the Company effective March 1, 2024. Legal and professional fees declined approximately 1,400 during the six months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to the decrease in litigation and consulting fees related to the Seaguard arbitration award that was settled and paid during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, as well as due to cost containment measures.

Additionally, travel and entertainment expense decreased approximately 100 during the six months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of cost-cutting measures implemented by the Company in order to achieve savings. Finally, insurance expense decreased approximately 100 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of a certain premium reductions. As an offset to these decreases, the Company experienced an increase in taxes and licensing fees of approximately 200 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 related to the implementation of a new ERP system the Company has begun undertaking during the current quarter. 
 Engineering and technical support expenses decreased 1,757 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. This decrease was due in part to a decline in research and development expense of approximately 900, and was positively impacted by the formation of the BioCenturion LLC joint venture by EyeLock LLC and GalvanEyes Partners LLC on March 1, 2024, which EyeLock has accounted for as an equity method investment. As a result, these expenses have decreased substantially for the Company's EyeLock subsidiary. Research and development expenses also decreased during the three months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of the timing of the commencement and completion of projects. Labor expense and related benefits also decreased approximately 900 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 resulting primarily from Company-wide headcount reductions, as well as lower use of outside labor during the period and higher reimbursement of engineering expenses as compared to the prior year. Offsetting these decreases in engineering and technical support expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company experienced an increase in payroll tax expenses of approximately 100. During the comparable prior year period, the Company received Employee Reduction Credits related to the COVID-19 pandemic that offset payroll tax expense for the three months ended August 31, 2023, which did not repeat in the current year. 
 Engineering and technical support expenses decreased 3,850 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. This decrease was due in part to a decline in research and development expense of approximately 1,900, and was positively impacted by the formation of the BioCenturion LLC joint venture by EyeLock LLC and GalvanEyes Partners LLC on March 1, 2024, which EyeLock has accounted for as an equity method investment. As a result, these expenses have decreased substantially for the Company's EyeLock subsidiary. Research and development expenses also decreased during the six months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of the timing of the commencement and completion of projects. Labor expense and related benefits also decreased approximately 1,900 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 primarily as a result of Company-wide headcount reductions, as well as lower use of outside labor during the period and higher reimbursement of engineering expenses as compared to the prior year. 
 Restructuring expenses increased 90 and 262 for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended August 31, 2023. During both the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, restructuring costs were primarily comprised of severance expense related to Company-wide headcount reductions, including 
 42 

those related to the domestic accessories business of the Company's Voxx Accessories Corp. subsidiary, which was sold during the second quarter of Fiscal 2025. During the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, restructuring expenses also included costs related to the relocation of certain OEM production operations from Florida to Mexico, which is expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.

Interest and bank charges represent interest expense and fees related to the Company's bank obligations, shareholder loan, supply chain financing and factoring agreements, interest related to finance leases, and amortization of debt issuance costs. During the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, interest charges on the funds borrowed from the Wells Fargo Credit Facility have increased as compared to the three and six months ended August 31, 2023 primarily due to the increase in funds borrowed, as well as an increase in interest rates. 
 Equity in income of equity investees represents the Company's share of income from its 50 non-controlling ownership interests in ASA Electronics LLC and Subsidiaries ("ASA") and BioCenturion LLC, in which the Company began investing on March 1, 2024. The decrease in income for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year period is due to lower net income at ASA resulting from a decline in sales caused by current economic conditions, as well as due to losses incurred by BioCenturion which were not present in the prior year period. 
 During August 2024, the Company sold certain assets of two of its wholly owned subsidiaries, VOXX Accessories Corp. and Premium Audio Company, LLC. The Company recognized gains on the sale of these assets of 8,300 and 2,154, respectively, for the three and six months ended August 31, 2024. 
 During the three and six months ended August 31, 2023, the Company recorded charges representing interest expense, legal fee reimbursements, and a settlement related to patent arbitration in connection with the final arbitration award due to Seaguard. The final arbitration award settlement was paid during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. 
 Other, net includes net foreign currency gains or losses, interest income, rental income, a loss on the contribution of assets to a joint venture, and other miscellaneous income and expense. During the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company had net foreign currency gains of 3,204 and 1,353, respectively, as compared to net foreign currency losses of 1,261 and 2,248 for the three and six months ended August 31, 2023, respectively. Foreign currency gains and losses incurred during the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 were primarily driven by fluctuations in the Japanese Yen, which impacted the re-measurement of the Company's Onkyo subsidiary intercompany loans and interest payable which are not of a long-term investment nature. For the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recognized gains of 1,915 and 779, respectively, related to these remeasurements, compared to losses of 892 and 1,347 for the three and six months ended August 31, 2023, respectively.

Income Tax Provision 
 The Company s provision for income taxes consists of federal, foreign, and state taxes necessary to align the Company s year-to-date tax provision with the annual effective rate that it expects to achieve for the full year. At each interim period, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate and records cumulative adjustments, as necessary. At each interim period, the Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required. Given the VAC sale of business that occurred in the interim quarter ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined that its Canadian deferred tax assets will not be realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. As such, the Company recorded an increase to its valuation allowance as a discrete item during the quarter. 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 1,600, which includes a discrete income tax provision of 1,265 primarily related to increases in its valuation allowance in connection with deferred tax assets in Canada and Australia. The effective tax rate for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was an income tax provision of 47.2 on pre-tax income of 3,392. The effective tax rate for the three months ended August 31, 2024 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 mostly related to the discrete items discussed above, as well as a number of factors including no income tax benefit recorded on current year U.S and Japanese pre-tax losses given the Company maintains a full valuation allowance, income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at varying tax rates, nondeductible permanent differences, research and development credits, and adjustments to the deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived intangibles. 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 1,170, which includes a discrete income tax provision of 115. The effective tax rate for the three months ended August 31, 2023 was an income tax provision of 10.3 on pre-tax loss of 11,407. The effective tax rate for the three months ended August 31, 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 as a result of a number of factors, primarily related to no income tax benefit recorded on current year U.S and Japanese pre-tax losses given the Company maintains a full valuation allowance, income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at varying tax rates, nondeductible permanent differences, research and development credits, and adjustments to our deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived intangibles. 
 For the six months ended August 31, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax provision of 1,006, which includes a discrete income tax provision of 1,158 related primarily to increases in valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in Canada (as discussed above) and Australia. The effective tax rate for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was an income tax expense of 13.6 on pre-tax loss of 7,379. The effective tax rate for the six months ended August 31, 2024 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 as a result of a number of factors, primarily related to no income tax benefit recorded on current year U.S. and Japanese pre-tax losses given the Company maintains a full valuation allowance, income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at varying tax rates, nondeductible permanent differences, research and development credits, adjustments to the deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived intangibles, and the discrete items discussed above. 
 For the six months ended August 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 151, which includes a discrete income tax benefit of 317 related primarily to the reversal of uncertain tax position liabilities as a result of the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations offset by the remeasurement of state deferred taxes based on law changes enacted during the period. The effective tax rate for the six months ended August 31, 2023 was an income tax benefit of 0.6 on pre-tax loss of 24,433. The effective tax rate for the six months ended August 31, 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 as a result of a number of factors, primarily related to no income tax benefit recorded on current year U.S and Japanese pre-tax losses given the Company maintains a full valuation allowance, income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at varying tax rates, nondeductible permanent differences, research and development credits, and adjustments to our deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived intangibles. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures recognized by GAAP. EBITDA represents net loss attributable to VOXX International Corporation and Subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense and bank charges, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, gains on the sale of certain assets and businesses, foreign currency gains and losses, restructuring expenses, certain non-routine legal fees, and awards. Depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and foreign currency gains and losses are non-cash items. 
 We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this Form 10-Q because we consider them to be useful and appropriate supplemental measures of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA helps us to evaluate our performance without the effects of certain GAAP calculations that may not have a direct cash impact on our current operating performance. In addition, the exclusion of 
 44 

certain costs or gains relating to certain events allows for a more meaningful comparison of our results from period-to-period. These non-GAAP measures, as we define them, are not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be assessed in isolation from, are not intended to represent, and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows, Commitments and Obligations 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had working capital of 118,940 which includes cash and cash equivalents of 3,661, compared with working capital of 138,885 at February 29, 2024, which included cash and cash equivalents of 10,986. We plan to utilize our current cash position as well as collections from accounts receivable, the cash generated from our operations, when applicable, and the income on our investments to fund the current operations of the business. However, we may utilize all or a portion of current capital resources to pursue other business opportunities, including acquisitions, or to further pay down our debt. As of August 31, 2024, we had cash balances totaling 160 held in foreign bank accounts, none of which would have been subject to United States federal income taxes if made available for use in the United States. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides a 100 participation exemption on dividends received from foreign corporations after January 1, 2018, as the United States has moved away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations. 
 Operating activities provided cash of 11,989 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory, as well as the increase in accounts payable. This was offset by a decrease in accrued sales incentives, as well as due to the decrease in the Company's net sales. For the six months ended August 31, 2023, operating activities provided cash of 2,561 due to factors including the decrease in accounts receivable, and was offset by the decrease in accrued sales incentives, as well as due to losses incurred by EyeLock LLC and the decrease in the Company's net sales. 
 Investing activities provided cash of 1,466 during the six months ended August 31, 2024 primarily due to proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, offset by capital expenditures. For the six months ended August 31, 2023, investing activities used cash of 961 primarily due to capital expenditures, offset by the proceeds from the sale of an intangible asset. 
 45 

Financing activities used cash of 19,359 during the six months ended August 31, 2024 due primarily to repayments of borrowings from the Credit Facility, the Florida mortgage, and finance leases, as well as due to the settlement of market stock units and the purchase of treasury shares. This was offset by borrowings from the Company's Credit Facility and proceeds from the repayment of a shareholder loan receivable. During the six months ended August 31, 2023, financing activities used cash of 3,422 due primarily to repayments of borrowings from the Company's Credit Facility and Florida mortgage, as well as the purchase of treasury shares. This was offset by borrowings from the Credit Facility. 
 The Company has a senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Facility") that provides for a revolving credit facility with committed availability of up to 165,000. The availability under the revolving credit line within the Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory, certain real estate, and certain intellectual property, subject to reserves as determined by the lender, and is also limited by amounts outstanding under the Florida Mortgage (see Note 18(b)). The availability under the revolving credit line of the Credit Facility was 62,275 as of August 31, 2024. 
 All amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will mature and become due on April 19, 2026; however, it is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Agreement). The Company may prepay any amounts outstanding at any time. The commitments under the Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced at any time, without premium or penalty as set forth in the Agreement. 
 Generally, the Company may designate specific borrowings under the Credit Facility as either Base Rate Loans or SOFR Rate Loans, except that Swing Loans may only be designated as Base Rate Loans. Loans designated as SOFR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the then applicable SOFR rate plus a range of 1.75 - 2.25 . Loans designated as Base Rate loans shall bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable margin for Base Rate Loans plus a range of 0.75 - 1.25 , as defined in the Agreement, and shall not be lower than 1.75 . 
 Provided that the Company is in a Compliance Period (the period commencing on that day in which Excess Availability is less than 15 of the Maximum Revolver Amount and ending on a day in which Excess Availability is equal to or greater than 15 for any consecutive 30-day period thereafter), the Credit Facility requires compliance with a financial covenant calculated as of the last day of each month, consisting of a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Credit Facility also contains covenants, subject to defined carveouts, that limit the ability of the loan parties and certain of their subsidiaries which are not loan parties to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) incur liens; (iii) merge, consolidate or dispose of a substantial portion of their business; (iv) transfer or dispose of assets; (v) change their name, organizational identification number, state or province of organization or organizational identity; (vi) make any material change in their nature of business; (vii) prepay or otherwise acquire indebtedness; (viii) cause any change of control; (ix) make any restricted junior payment, including the declaration of dividends; (x) change their fiscal year or method of accounting; (xi) make advances, loans or investments; (xii) enter into or permit any transaction with an affiliate of any borrower or any of their subsidiaries; (xiii) use proceeds for certain items; (xiv) issue or sell any of their stock; or (xv) consign or sell any of their inventory on certain terms. In addition, if excess availability under the Credit Facility were to fall below certain specified levels, as defined in the Agreement, the lenders would have the right to assume dominion and control over the Company's cash. 
 The obligations under the Credit Facility documents are secured by a general lien on and security interest in substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and certain of the guarantors, including accounts receivable, equipment, real estate, general intangibles, and inventory. The Company, as parent, has guaranteed the obligations of its subsidiary borrowers under the Agreement. 
 The Company has a Euro asset-based loan facility in Germany with a credit limit of 8,000 that expires on October 31, 2024. The Company's subsidiaries Voxx German Holdings GmbH, Oehlbach Kabel GmbH, and Schwaiger GmbH are authorized to borrow funds under this facility for working capital purposes. 
 The Company also utilizes supply chain financing arrangements and factoring agreements as a component of its financing for working capital, which accelerates receivable collection and helps to better manage cash flow. Under the agreements, the Company has agreed to sell certain of its accounts receivable balances to banking institutions who have agreed to advance amounts equal to the net accounts receivable balances due, less a discount as set forth in the respective agreements (see Note 10). The balances under these agreements are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, as they are sold without recourse. Cash proceeds from these agreements are reflected as operating activities included in the change in accounts receivable in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fees incurred in connection with the agreements are recorded as interest expense by the Company.

1. Represents total principal payments due under operating and finance lease obligations. Total current balances (included in Accrued expenses other current liabilities) due under finance and operating lease obligations are 305 and 1,017, respectively, at August 31, 2024. Total long-term balances due under finance and operating leases are 484 and 1,917, respectively, at August 31, 2024. 

2. Represents amounts outstanding under the Company s Credit Facility and the VOXX Germany Euro asset-based lending facility at August 31, 2024. 

3. We issue standby and commercial letters of credit to secure certain purchases and insurance requirements. 

4. This amount represents the outstanding balances of the mortgage for our manufacturing facility in Florida and the shareholder loan payable to a joint venture partner. 

5. Open purchase obligations represent inventory commitments. These obligations are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements until commitments are fulfilled given that such obligations are subject to change based on negotiations with manufacturers. 

We regularly review our cash funding requirements and attempt to meet those requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash provided by operations, available borrowings under bank lines of credit and possible future public or private debt and/or equity offerings. At times, we evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses that are complementary to ours, which transactions may require the use of cash. We believe that our cash, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, credit arrangements, and access to equity capital markets, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating expenditures for the next twelve months. In the event they do not, we may require additional funds in the future to support our working capital requirements, or for other purposes, and may seek to raise such additional funds through the sale of public or private equity and/or debt financings, as well as from other sources. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available in the future or that if available, such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable when required. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 On April 29, 2021 EyeLock LLC entered into a three-year exclusive distribution agreement the Agreement with GalvanEyes LLC, a Florida LLC, managed by Beat Kahli, the Vice Chairman of Voxx's Board of Directors. The Agreement was included in the Company s Proxy Statement filed on June 17, 2021 and was approved by the Company s shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on July 29, 2021. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statement of this Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Voxx conducts business in various non-U.S. countries, including Germany, Canada, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Australia, and Japan and thus is exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside of the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. For the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, a uniform 10 strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have resulted in a decrease in sales of approximately 2,000 and 4,100, and an increase in net loss of approximately 2 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and a decrease in net income of 26 for the six months ended August 31, 2024, respectively. The effects of foreign currency exchange rates on future results would also be impacted by changes in sales levels or local currency prices. 
 While the prices we pay for products purchased from our suppliers are principally denominated in United States dollars, price negotiations depend in part on the foreign currency of foreign manufacturers, as well as market, trade, and political factors. The Company also has exposure related to transactions in which the currency collected from customers is different from the currency utilized to purchase the product sold in its foreign operations, and U.S. dollar denominated purchases in its foreign subsidiaries. One of the Company's Euro subsidiaries enters forward contracts to hedge certain U.S. dollar transactions. The Company minimizes the risk of nonperformance on the forward contracts by transacting with major financial institutions. On August 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency contracts designated for hedge accounting. For the three and six months ended August 31, 2024, unrealized gains of 1 and 13 were recorded in other comprehensive income associated with these contracts. 
 We are also subject to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates from the translation of financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and for long-term intercompany loans with the foreign subsidiaries. These changes result in cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. At August 31, 2024, we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies with the most significant being the Euro and the Japanses Yen. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates would result in a negative impact of 60 on Other comprehensive loss (income) for the six months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on investment of available cash balances in money market funds and investment grade corporate and U.S. government securities. In addition, our bank loans expose us to changes in short-term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are either variable or fixed. We have variable rate indebtedness related to our Credit Facility and Euro asset-based lending facility in Germany. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates to the extent that we have balances outstanding under these variable rate loans. At August 31, 2024, the balance outstanding on the Credit Facility was 45,832 and there was no balance outstanding on the German asset-based lending facility (see Note 18). In connection with the Florida Mortgage, we have debt outstanding in the amount of 5,365 at August 31, 2024. Interest on this mortgage is charged at 79 of the applicable SOFR rate plus 1.87 . The Company had an interest rate swap for the Florida Mortgage with a notional amount of 5,365 at August 31, 2024. This swap locks the interest rate at 3.43 (inclusive of credit spread) on the Florida Mortgage through the mortgage end date of March 2026. 
 As of August 31, 2024, the total net fair value of the interest rate swap recorded in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet is 75, which represents the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreement based on market conditions on that date. Changes in the fair value of this interest rate swap agreement are reflected as an adjustment to other assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of August 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required 
 49 

to be disclosed by the Company in its filing under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the six months ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
