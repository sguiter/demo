 We incurred legal and bank fees related to the issuance of debt. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, debt issuance costs reported in other noncurrent assets on the balance sheet were approximately (i) million and million, respectively, net of amortization, for the Credit Agreement, dated as of August 26, 2021, among Berry Corp, as a guarantor, Berry LLC, as the borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent and an issuing bank, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto (as amended, restated, modified or otherwise supplemented from time to time, the 2021 RBL Facility and (ii) an immaterial amount, net of amortization, for the Revolving Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2022, among C J and C J Management, as borrowers, and Tri Counties Bank, as lender (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2022 ABL Facility ). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, debt issuance costs, net of amortization, for the unsecured notes due February 2026 (the 2026 Notes reported in Long-Term Debt, net on the balance sheet were approximately million and million, respectively. 
 For each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amortization expense for the 2021 RBL Facility, the 2022 ABL Facility and the 2026 Notes, combined, was approximately million. For each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amortization expense for the 2021 RBL Facility, the 2022 ABL Facility and the 2026 Notes, combined, was approximately million. The amortization of debt issuance costs is presented in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Fair Value 
 Our debt is recorded at the carrying amount on the balance sheets. The carrying amounts of the 2021 RBL Facility and the 2022 ABL Facility approximate fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflect market rates. The 2021 RBL Facility and 2022 ABL Facility are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the 2026 Notes was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 2026 Notes are Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy and the fair value is based on available market pricing. 
 2021 RBL Facility 
 The 2021 RBL Facility provides for a revolving loan with up to million of commitment, subject to a borrowing base and an aggregate elected commitment amount. The borrowing base under the 2021 RBL Facility is redetermined semi-annually, and the borrowing base redeterminations generally become effective each May and November, although the borrower and the lenders may each make one interim redetermination between scheduled redeterminations. On August 20, 2024, the scheduled semi-annual redetermination of the borrowing base occurred under the Credit Agreement, dated as of August 26, 2021 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement ), by and among Berry Corporation (bry) as a guarantor, Berry LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, as the borrower (the Borrower ), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. In connection with such redetermination, the Borrower s borrowing base and aggregate elected committed amount are each million (previously million), effective as of the redetermination date. In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the next scheduled semi-annual borrowing base redetermination will be in or around November 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2021 RBL Facility had a million revolving commitment, a million borrowing base, a million aggregate elected commitment amount and a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit (with borrowing availability being reduced by the face amount of any letters of credit issued under the subfacility). Availability under the 2021 RBL Facility may not exceed the lesser of the aggregate elected commitment amount or the borrowing base less outstanding advances and letters of credit. The 2021 RBL Facility matures on August 26, 2025, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the 2021 RBL Facility. The 2021 RBL Facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including working capital. 
 The outstanding borrowings under the 2021 RBL Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a customary base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to or (b) a term SOFR reference rate, plus an applicable margin ranging from to , in each case determined based on the utilization level under the 2021 RBL Facility. Interest on base rate borrowings is payable quarterly in arrears and interest on term SOFR borrowings accrues in respect of interest periods of one , three or , at the election of the borrower, and is payable on the last day of such interest period (or, for interest periods of six months, three months after the commencement of such interest period and at the end of such interest period). Unused commitment fees are charged at a rate of . 
 The 2021 RBL Facility provides that, to the extent we incur unsecured indebtedness, including any amounts raised in the future, the borrowing base will be reduced by an amount equal to of the amount of such unsecured debt. In addition, the 2021 RBL Facility requires us to maintain on a consolidated basis as of each quarter-end (i) a leverage ratio of not more than to 1.0 and (ii) a current ratio of not less than to 1.0. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of covenants under the 2021 RBL Facility. 
 The 2021 RBL Facility also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default and remedies. If we do not comply with the financial and other covenants in the 2021 RBL Facility, the lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the 2021 RBL Facility and terminate the commitments thereunder. 
 The 2021 RBL Facility is guaranteed by Berry Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries. Each future subsidiary of Berry Corp., with certain exceptions, is required to guarantee our obligations and obligations of the other guarantors under the 2021 RBL Facility and under certain hedging transactions and banking services arrangements. The lenders under the 2021 RBL Facility hold a mortgage on at least of the present value of our proven oil and gas reserves. The obligations of Berry LLC and the guarantors are also secured by liens on substantially all of our personal property, subject to customary exceptions. C J and C J Management do not guarantee the 2021 RBL Facility or grant any liens on their assets to secure any obligations under the 2021 RBL Facility. 
 
 On July 30, 2024, we entered into a letter agreement to amend the 2021 RBL Facility to extend the permitted tenor of certain commodity hedging agreements which we may enter into, from a tenor not to exceed months to a tenor not to exceed months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had million borrowings outstanding, million in letters of credit outstanding and approximately million of available borrowing capacity under the 2021 RBL Facility. Under the terms of the 2024 Term Loan Agreement, the 2021 RBL Facility will be terminated upon funding of the 2024 Term Loan. 
 2022 ABL Facility 
 
 Subject to satisfaction of customary conditions precedent to borrowing, as of September 30, 2024, C J and C J Management could borrow up to the lesser of (x) million and (y) the borrowing base under the 2022 ABL Facility, with a letter of credit subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed million (with borrowing availability being reduced by the face amount of any letters of credit issued under the subfacility). The borrowing base is an amount equal to of the balance due on eligible accounts receivable, subject to reserves that the lender may implement in its reasonable discretion. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base was million. Interest on the outstanding principal amount of the revolving loans under the 2022 ABL Facility accrues at a per annum rate equal to in excess of the variable rate of interest, on a per annum basis, which is announced and/or published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal from time to time as its Prime Rate . Interest is due quarterly, in arrears. In June 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to Revolving Loan and Security Agreement and Amendment to Other Loan Documents which, among other things, extended the maturity of the 2022 ABL Facility from June 5, 2025 to June 5, 2027, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the 2022 ABL Facility. 
 The 2022 ABL Facility requires C J and C J Management to comply with the following financial covenants: (i) maintain on a consolidated basis a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of no greater than to 1.0 at any time; (ii) reduce the amount of revolving advances outstanding under the 2022 ABL Facility to not more than of the lesser of (a) the maximum revolving advance amount or (b) the borrowing base, as of the lender s close of business on the last day of each fiscal quarter; and (iii) maintain net income before taxes of not less than as of each fiscal year end. As of September 30, 2024, each of C J and C J Management was in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2022 ABL Facility. 
 
 The 2022 ABL Facility also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default and remedies. If C J or C J Management does not comply with the financial and other covenants in the 2022 ABL Facility, the lender may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the 2022 ABL Facility and terminate the commitment thereunder. The obligations of C J and C J Management under the 2022 ABL Facility are guaranteed by C J Management and C J, respectively, and are secured by liens on substantially all of the personal property of C J and C J Management, subject to customary exceptions. The obligations of C J and C J Management under the 2022 ABL Facility are not guaranteed by Berry Corp. or Berry LLC and Berry Corp. and Berry LLC do not and are not required to provide any credit support for such obligations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, each of C J and C J Management had borrowings and million letters of credit outstanding with million of available borrowing capacity under the 2022 ABL Facility. Under the terms of the 2024 Term Loan Agreement, the 2022 ABL Facility will be terminated upon funding of the 2024 Term Loan. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes Due February 2026 
 In February 2018, Berry LLC completed a private issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due February 2026, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting expenses and the initial purchasers discount. 
 The 2026 Notes are Berry LLC s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior indebtedness and senior to any of our subordinated indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Berry Corp and certain of its subsidiaries. C J and C J Management do not guarantee the 2026 Notes. 
 The indenture governing the 2026 Notes contains customary covenants and events of default (in some cases, subject to grace periods). We were in compliance with all covenants under the 2026 Notes as of September 30, 2024. 
 In conjunction with and subject to the closing of the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement discussed below, the Company is required to redeem the 2026 Notes. This report does not constitute a notice of redemption of the 2026 Notes. 
 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement 
 Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024, but before the issuance date of these financials, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, Breakwall Credit Management LLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto.

If an Event of Default (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement) exists and is continuing, upon the election of the Majority Lenders (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement) under the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, or automatically without such election, in the case of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or payment default, all amounts outstanding under the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement will bear interest at per annum above the rate and margin otherwise applicable thereto (it being understood that the Majority Lenders may elect for the application of default interest to commence on any date that is on or after the occurrence of such Event of Default while such

 In addition, the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement is subject to customary events of default, including a change in control (which change of control event of default is subject to a carve-out for no decline in the Company s corporate credit rating). If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent or the majority lenders may accelerate any amounts outstanding and terminate lender commitments and exercise remedies against any collateral. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement became effective on November 6, 2024 (the Closing ).

We have also entered into gas transportation contracts to help reduce the price fluctuation exposure, however these do not qualify as hedges. We also, from time to time, have entered into agreements to purchase a portion of the natural gas we require for our operations, which we do not record at fair value as derivatives because they qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exclusions. We had no such transactions in the periods presented. 
 Oil Sales Hedges 
 For fixed-price sales swaps, we are the seller, so we make settlement payments for prices above the indicated weighted-average price per bbl and per mmbtu, respectively, and receive settlement payments for prices below the indicated weighted-average price per bbl and per mmbtu, respectively. 
 For our sold call options, we would make settlement payments for prices above the indicated weighted-average price per barrel, net of any deferred premium. No payment would be made or received for prices below the indicated weighted-average price per barrel, other than any applicable deferred premium. 
 For our purchased puts, we would receive settlement payments for prices below the indicated weighted-average price per barrel, net of any deferred premium. No payment would be made or received for prices above the indicated weighted-average price per barrel, other than any applicable deferred premium. 
 For our sold puts, we would make settlement payments for prices below the indicated weighted-average price per barrel, net of any deferred premium. No payment would be made or received for prices above the indicated weighted-average price per barrel, other than any applicable deferred premium. 
 Gas Purchase Hedges 
 For fixed-price gas purchase swaps, we are the buyer, so we make settlement payments for prices below the indicated weighted-average price per mmbtu and receive settlement payments for prices above the indicated weighted-average price per mmbtu. 
 For some of our options we paid or received a premium at the time the positions were created and for others, the premium payment or receipt is deferred until the time of settlement. As of September 30, 2024, we have net payable deferred premiums of less than million, which is reflected in the mark-to-market valuation and will be payable through December 31, 2024. 
 We use oil and gas production hedges to protect our sales against decreases in oil and gas prices. We also use natural gas purchase hedges to protect our natural gas purchases against increases in prices. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes and have not accounted for our derivatives as cash-flow or fair-value hedges. The changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in current earnings. Gains (losses) on oil and gas sales hedges are classified in the revenues and other section of the statement of operations, while natural gas purchase hedges are included in expenses and other section of the statement of operations.

 By using derivative instruments to economically hedge exposure to changes in commodity prices, we expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk. We do not receive collateral from our counterparties. 
 We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by limiting our exposure to any single counterparty. In addition, our 2021 RBL Facility prevents us from entering into hedging arrangements that are secured, except with our lenders and their affiliates, or with a non-lender counterparty that does not have an A or A2 credit rating or better from Standard Poor s or Moody s, respectively. In accordance with our standard practice, our commodity derivatives are subject to counterparty netting under agreements governing such derivatives which partially mitigates the counterparty nonperformance risk.

 Securities Litigation Matters 
 In November 2020, a putative securities class action (the Securities Class Action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, claiming that Berry Corp. and certain of its current and former directors and officers violated the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934 by allegedly making false and misleading statements between the IPO and November 3, 2020, and in the IPO offering materials, about the Company s permits and permitting processes. 
 While the motion for class certification was still pending before the court, the parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle all claims in the Securities Class Action for an aggregate sum of million. Following notice to the class and an opt-out and objection process, the Court granted final approval of the settlement on February 6, 2024, and terminated the case. The Defendants continue to maintain that the claims were without merit and admitted no liability in connection with the settlement. 
 While the Securities Class Action is now concluded, certain related shareholder derivative actions remain pending. On October 20, 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit (the Assad Lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas by putative stockholder George Assad, allegedly on behalf of the Company, that piggy-backs on the Securities Class Action and is currently pending before the same court. The derivative complaint names certain current and former officers and directors as defendants, and generally alleges that they breached their fiduciary duties by causing or failing to prevent the securities violations alleged in the Securities Class Action. The derivative complaint also alleges claims for unjust enrichment as against all defendants, and claims for contribution and indemnification under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. On January 27, 2023, the court granted the parties joint stipulated request to stay the Assad Lawsuit pending resolution of the Securities Class Action. 
 
 On January 20, 2023, a second shareholder derivative lawsuit (the Karp Lawsuit, together with the Assad Lawsuit, the Shareholder Derivative Actions was filed, this time in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, by putative stockholder Molly Karp, allegedly on behalf of the Company, again piggy-backing on the Securities Class Action. This complaint, similar to the Assad Lawsuit, is brought against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company, asserting breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and contribution claims based on the defendants allegedly having caused or failed to prevent the securities violations alleged in the Securities Class Action. In addition, the complaint asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, alleging that Berry s 2022 proxy statement was false and misleading in that it suggested the Company s internal controls were sufficient and the Board of Directors was adequately overseeing material risks facing the Company when, according to the derivative plaintiff, that was not the case. On February 13, 2023, the court granted the parties joint stipulated request to stay the Karp Lawsuit pending further developments in the Securities Class Action.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report ), as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). When we use the terms we, us, our, Berry, the Company or similar words in this report, we are referring to, as the context may require, Berry Corp., together with its subsidiaries, Berry LLC, C J Management, and C J. 
 
 Our Company 
 We are a value-driven western United States independent upstream energy company with a focus on onshore, low geologic risk, low decline, long-lived oil and gas reserves. We operate in two business segments: (i) exploration and production E P and (ii) well servicing and abandonment. Our E P assets are located in California and Utah, are characterized by high oil content and are predominantly located in rural areas with low population. Our California assets are in the San Joaquin basin (100 oil), while our Utah assets are in the Uinta basin (60 oil and 40 gas). We operate our well servicing and abandonment segment in California. 
 With respect to our E P business in California, we focus on conventional, shallow oil reservoirs. The drilling and completion of such wells are relatively low-cost in contrast to unconventional resource plays. The California oil market is primarily tied to Brent-influenced pricing which has typically realized premium pricing relative to West Texas Intermediate WTI ). All of our California assets are located in oil-rich reservoirs in the San Joaquin basin, which has more than 150 years of production history and substantial oil remaining in place. As a result of the data generated over the basin s long history of production, its reservoir characteristics and low geological risk opportunities are generally well understood. In September 2023, we completed the acquisition of Macpherson Energy (so called, or the Macpherson Acquisition ), a privately held Kern County, California operator. The acquired assets are high-quality, low decline oil producing properties that are closely located to existing Berry properties in rural Kern County, California. In December 2023 and in the second quarter of 2024, we acquired additional, highly synergistic working interests in Kern County, California. These assets align with our strategy of acquiring accretive, producing bolt-ons in support of our goal to maintain flat production year-over-year. 
 We have upstream assets in Utah, located in the Uinta basin, which produce oil and natural gas at depths ranging from 4,000 feet to 8,000 feet. We have high operational control of our existing acreage, which provides significant upside for additional development and recompletions. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 99,000 net acres in the Uinta basin. Over the last year, the Uinta basin has experienced an increase in activity, including successful results from horizontal drilling across the basin which indicates new development potential for our existing acreage. Our historic Uinta basin development has focused on vertical production from five reservoirs and we are now actively evaluating horizontal drilling potential. In April 2024, we purchased a 21 working interest in four, two-to-three mile lateral wells in the Uteland Butte reservoir, adjacent to our existing operations, which were put on production in the second quarter of 2024. The initial production rates from those four wells are better than our initial expectations. In November 2024, we executed an agreement to exchange, on an equal value basis, certain of our oil, gas, and mineral leasehold interests in Duchesne County, Utah, for that of another operator s, also located in Duchesne County, Utah. We will receive an approximately 17 working interest in three, three-mile Drilling Spacing Units (DSUs) in exchange for an approximately 75 working interest in one, two-mile DSU. Like the first four horizontal wells, these wells are adjacent to our existing operations, and the results from all of these farmed-in horizontal wells will be used to evaluate opportunities on our own acreage. We believe horizontal well development of our own acreage could be a substantial opportunity, with low break-even economics and a runway of future development in the increasingly active Uinta basin. With a high working interest in our 99,000 acres and the majority of acreage held by production, we are strategically positioned to develop our own acreage horizontally at an optimal pace, staying true to our commitment to generate free cash flow. We believe doing so has the potential to unlock all of our Uinta net acres while allowing us to maintain disciplined financial policies.

In our well servicing and abandonment segment, we operate one of the largest upstream well servicing and abandonment businesses in California, which operates as C J. C J provides wellsite services in California to oil and natural gas production companies, including well servicing and water logistics. Additionally, C J performs plugging and abandonment services on wells at the end of their productive life, which we believe has upside opportunity based on the significant inventory of idle wells within California coupled with existing and new regulations that are expected to increase the obligations of operators with respect to those idle wells. C J also provides a competitive advantage to Berry by providing access and control over an important part of our supply chain. 
 We believe that the successful execution of our strategy across our low-declining, oil-weighted production base, coupled with extensive inventory of identified drilling, sidetrack and workover locations with attractive full-cycle economics, will support our objectives to maintain production levels year-over-year and generate free cash flow, which funds our operations, optimizes capital efficiency and maximizes enterprise value. We also strive to maintain an appropriate liquidity position and manageable leverage profile that will enable us to explore attractive organic and strategic growth through commodity price cycles and acquisitions. In addition to operating and developing our existing world-class assets efficiently and strategically under the highest compliance standards, we seek to acquire accretive, producing bolt-on properties that complement our existing operations, enhance our cash flows and allow us to further our strategy of maintaining production levels year-over-year, subject to delays in the issuance of necessary permits and approvals. For more information, see Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties Regulatory Matters Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry in our Annual Report. Our strategy includes proactively engaging the many forces driving our industry and impacting our operations, whether positive or negative, to maximize the utility of our assets, create value for shareholders, and support environmental goals that align with safer, more efficient and lower emission operations. 
 
 How We Plan and Evaluate Operations 
 We use the following metrics to manage and assess the performance of our operations: (a) Adjusted EBITDA; (b) Free Cash Flow; (c) production from our E P business (d) E P field operations measures; (e) HSE results; (f) general and administrative expenses; and (g) the performance of our well servicing and abandonment operations based on activity levels, pricing and relative performance for each service provided. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial and operating measurement that our management uses to analyze and monitor the operating performance of both our E P business and CJWS. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in planning our capital expenditure allocation to maintain production levels year-over-year and determining our strategic hedging needs aside from the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL Facility and 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion, and amortization DD A derivative gains or losses net of cash received or paid for scheduled derivative settlements; impairments; stock compensation expense; and unusual and infrequent items. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of net income (loss) and net cash provided (used) by operating activities, our most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. This supplemental non-GAAP financial measure is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We use Free Cash Flow as the primary metric to measure our ability to pay dividends, pay down debt, repurchase stock, and make strategic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance, and it should not be inferred that the entire amount of Free Cash Flow is available for dividends, debt pay down, share repurchases, bolt-on acquisitions or other growth opportunities, or other discretionary expenditures, since we have non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure. Free Cash Flow

Table of Contents 

 is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities, our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow. 
 We previously reported Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, and made allocations of Adjusted Free Cash Flow in connection with our shareholder return model, most recently (a) 80 primarily in the form of debt repurchases, stock repurchases, strategic growth, and acquisitions of producing bolt-on assets; and (b) 20 in the form of variable dividends. However, in October 2024, in anticipation of entering into the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, we transitioned away from the shareholder return model to a more flexible approach to capital allocation that aligns with the covenants contained in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement and prioritizes debt reduction while facilitating our operating strategy and enabling investment in development opportunities. For a discussion and presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the prior period, see our previous filings with the SEC. 
 Production 
 Oil and gas production is a key driver of our operating performance, an important factor to the success of our business, and used in forecasting future development economics. We measure and closely monitor production on a continuous basis, adjusting our property development efforts in accordance with the results. We track production by commodity type and compare it to prior periods and expected results. 
 E P Field Operations 
 Overall, management assesses the efficiency of our E P field operations by considering core E P operating expenses together with our cogeneration, marketing and transportation activities. In particular, a core component of our E P operations in California is steam, which we use to lift heavy oil to the surface. We operate several cogeneration facilities to produce some of the steam needed in our operations. In comparing the cost effectiveness of our cogeneration plants against other sources of steam in our operations, management considers the cost of operating the cogeneration plants, including the cost of the natural gas purchased to operate the facilities, against the value of the steam and electricity used in our E P field operations and the revenues we receive from sales of excess electricity to the grid. We strive to minimize the variability of our fuel gas costs for our California steam operations with natural gas purchase hedges. Consequently, the efficiency of our E P field operations is impacted by the cash settlements we receive or pay from these derivatives. We also have contracts for the transportation of fuel gas from the Rockies, which has historically been cheaper than the California markets. With respect to transportation and marketing, management also considers opportunistic sales of incremental capacity in assessing the overall efficiencies of E P operations. 
 Lease operating expenses include fuel, labor, field office, vehicle, supervision, maintenance, tools and supplies, and workover expenses. Electricity generation expenses include the portion of fuel, labor, maintenance, and tools and supplies from two of our cogeneration facilities allocated to electricity generation expense; the remaining cogeneration expenses are included in lease operating expense. Transportation expenses relate to our costs to transport the oil and gas that we produce within our properties or move it to the market. Marketing expenses mainly relate to natural gas purchased from third parties that moves through our gathering and processing systems and then sold to third parties. Electricity revenue is from the sale of excess electricity from two of our cogeneration facilities to a California utility company under long-term contracts at market prices. These cogeneration facilities are sized to satisfy the steam needs in their respective fields, but the corresponding electricity produced is more than the electricity that is currently required for the operations in those fields. Transportation sales relate to water and other liquids that we transport on our systems on behalf of third parties and marketing revenues represent sales of natural gas purchased from and sold to third parties.

 Health, Safety Environmental 
 Like other companies in the oil and gas industry, the operations of both our E P business and C J are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern health and safety, the release or discharge of materials, and land use or environmental protection that may restrict the use of our properties and operations, increase our costs or lower demand for or restrict the use of our products and services. Please see Regulatory Matters in this Quarterly Report as well as Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties Regulatory Matters and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report for a discussion of the potential impact that government regulations, including those regarding HSE matters, may have upon our business, operations, capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. 
 As part of our commitment to creating long-term value, we strive to conduct our operations in an ethical, safe and responsible manner, to protect the environment and to take care of our people and the communities in which we live and operate. We also seek proactive and transparent engagement with regulatory agencies, the communities in which we operate and our other stakeholders in order to realize the full potential of our resources in a timely fashion that safeguards people and the environment and complies with existing laws and regulations. We monitor our HSE performance through various measures, and we hold our employees and contractors to high standards. Meeting corporate HSE metrics, including with respect to HSE incidents and spill prevention, is a part of our short-term incentive program for all employees.

Business Environment, Market Conditions and Outlook 
 Our operating and financial results, and those of the oil and gas industry as a whole, are heavily influenced by commodity prices, including differentials, which have and may continue to, fluctuate significantly as a result of numerous market-related variables, including global geopolitical and economic conditions, and local and regional market factors and dislocations. Oil and natural gas prices have been, and may remain, volatile. As a net gas purchaser, our operating costs are generally expected to be more impacted by the volatility of natural gas prices than our gas sales. 
 Our well servicing and abandonment business is dependent on expenditures of oil and gas companies, which can in part reflect the volatility of commodity prices, as well as the impact from changes in the regulatory environment. Because existing oil and natural gas wells require ongoing spending to maintain production, expenditures by oil and gas companies for the maintenance of existing wells historically have been relatively stable and predictable when production is steady. Additionally, our customers requirements to plug and abandon wells are largely driven by regulatory requirements that are less dependent on commodity prices. 
 The price of oil is impacted by the actions of OPEC+ and recently they have implemented production cuts to address global supply levels. In June 2024, OPEC+ extended the reduced production quotas of 3.66 mmbbls/d through the end of 2025 and extended the 2.2 mmbbls/d voluntary cuts through the end of September 2024. In September 2024, OPEC+ agreed to extend their additional voluntary production cuts of 2.2 mmbbls/d for two months until the end of November 2024, after which these cuts will be gradually phased out on a monthly basis starting December 1st, 2024. Through the end of September, oil prices declined in 2024, but experienced an increase in early October 2024 due to increased geopolitical tension in the Middle East. 
 Sanctions and import bans on Russian oil have been implemented by various countries in response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, further altering flows of global oil supply. Oil and natural gas prices could decrease or increase with any changes in demand due to, among other things, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, international sanctions, speculation as to future actions by OPEC+, higher gas prices, high interest rates, inflation and government efforts to reduce inflation, and possible changes in the overall health of the global economy, including increased volatility in financial and credit markets or a prolonged recession. Further, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices could accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels, resulting in reduced demand over the longer term. To what extent these and other external factors (such as government action with respect to climate change regulation) ultimately impact our future business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and dependent on numerous factors, including future developments, that are not within our control and cannot be accurately predicted. 
 Additionally, like other companies in the oil and gas industry, our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to drilling, completion, well stimulation, operation, maintenance or abandonment of wells or facilities, managing energy, water, land, greenhouse gases or other emissions, protection of health, safety and the environment, or transportation, marketing, and sale of our products. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. See Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties Regulatory Matters Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters in our Annual Report for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. For more information related to regulatory risks, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Operations and Industry in our Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report. 
 Commodity Pricing and Differentials 
 Our revenue, costs, profitability, shareholder returns and future growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production, as well as the prices we pay for our natural gas purchases, which are affected by a variety of factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report.

 Oil Prices 
 California oil prices are Brent-influenced as California refiners import approximately 75 of the state s demand from OPEC+ countries and other waterborne sources. We believe that receiving Brent-influenced pricing contributes to our ability to continue realizing strong cash margins in California. Though the California market generally receives Brent-influenced pricing, California oil prices are also determined by local supply and demand dynamics, including third-party transportation and infrastructure capacity. In the third quarter of 2024, oil prices decreased relative to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Utah oil prices have historically traded at a discount to WTI. The oil is sold to local refineries that are designed for the oil's unique characteristics and via rail to refiners, primarily in the Gulf Coast. However, we have high operational control of our existing acreage, which provides significant upside for additional vertical and/or horizontal development wells and recompletions. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, Utah had an average realized oil price of 60.35, 65.58 and 70.48, respectively, compared to an average Brent oil price of 78.71, 85.03 and 85.92 for the same periods. 
 Gas Prices 
 For our California steam operations, the price we pay for fuel gas purchases is generally based on the Northwest, Rocky Mountains index plus transportation costs for the purchases made in the Rockies and the SoCal Gas city-gate index for the purchases made in California. We currently buy most of our gas in the Rockies. Now that we are purchasing a majority of our fuel gas in the Rockies, most of the purchases made in California use the SoCal Gas city-gate index, whereas prior to this shift the predominant index for California purchases was Kern, Delivered. The price from the Northwest, Rocky Mountain index was as high as 2.40 per mmbtu and as low as 1.42 per mmbtu in the third quarter of 2024. The price from the SoCal Gas city-gate index was as high as 3.19 per mmbtu and as low as 1.81 per mmbtu in the third quarter of 2024. Overall, on an unhedged basis, we paid an average of 2.70 per mmbtu in the third quarter of 2024 for our gas purchases which includes transportation costs. When including the hedging effects in our gas purchases, we paid 4.34, 4.30 and 5.61 per mmbtu in the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024, and the third quarter of 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 

The price of our fuel gas sales is generally based on the Northwest, Rocky Mountains index, as selling at the same index as fuel gas purchases provides a natural hedge for gas purchases. In the third quarter of 2024, our Utah operations had an average realized gas price of 2.01, compared to an average Northwest, Rocky Mountains gas price of 1.92, which was a 105 realization. In the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, Utah had an average realized gas price of 1.78, and 3.57, compared to an average Northwest, Rocky Mountains gas price of 1.40, or 127 realization, and 3.40, or 105 realization, respectively. 
 
 Natural gas prices and differentials are strongly affected by local market fundamentals, availability of transportation capacity from producing areas and seasonal impacts. Our key exposure to gas prices is in our costs. We purchase substantially more natural gas for our California steamfloods and cogeneration facilities than we produce and sell in the Rockies. We purchase most of our gas in the Rockies and transport it to our California operations using our Kern River pipeline capacity. We buy approximately 48,000 mmbtu/d in the Rockies, and the remainder comes from California markets. The volume purchased in California fluctuates and averaged 2,000 mbbtu/d in the third quarter of 2024, 2,000 mmbtu/d in the second quarter of 2024, and 6,000 mmbtu/d in the third quarter of 2023. The natural gas we purchase in the Rockies is shipped to our operations in California to help limit our exposure to California fuel gas purchase price fluctuations. We strive to further minimize the variability of our fuel gas costs for our steam operations by hedging a significant portion of our gas purchases. Additionally, the negative impact of higher gas prices on our California operating expenses is partially offset by higher gas sales for the gas we produce and sell in the Rockies. The Kern capacity allows us to purchase and sell natural gas at the same pricing indices. 
 
 We seek to mitigate a substantial portion of the gas purchase exposure for our cogeneration plants by selling excess electricity from our cogeneration operations to third parties at prices linked to the price of natural gas. Aside from the impact gas prices have on electricity prices, these sales are generally higher in the summer months as they include seasonal capacity amounts. Gas prices increased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. The natural gas futures indicate that prices will rise toward the end of 2024 and into 2025. Our hedging strategy coupled with our midstream access to gas from the Rockies helps us mitigate the impact of high natural gas prices on our cost structure. 
 
 Our earnings are also affected by the performance of our cogeneration facilities. These cogeneration facilities generate both electricity and steam for our properties and electricity for off-lease sales. While a portion of the electric output of our cogeneration facilities is utilized within our production facilities to reduce operating expenses, we also sell electricity produced by two of our cogeneration facilities under long-term contracts with terms ending in December 2025 and November 2026. The most significant input and cost of the cogeneration facilities is natural gas. 
 Prices and differentials for NGLs are related to the supply and demand for the products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products which are used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify pricing volatility. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Like other companies in the oil and gas industry, both our E P business and CJWS are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations, and California, where most of our operations and assets are located, is one of the most heavily regulated states in the United States with respect to oil and gas operations. Collectively, the effect of the existing laws and regulations is to limit the number and location of our wells through restrictions on the use of our properties, limit our ability to develop certain assets and conduct certain operations, including through a restrictive and burdensome permitting and approval process, and have the effect of reducing the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells, potentially reducing such production below levels that would otherwise be possible or economical. Additionally, the regulatory burden in the past has resulted, and in the future could result, in increased costs and consequently has had an adverse effect on operations, capital expenditures, earnings and our competitive position and may continue to have such effects in the future. Violations and liabilities with respect to these laws and regulations could also result in reputational damage and significant administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or 
 28 

Table of Contents 

revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. The costs of remedying such conditions may be significant, and remediation obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Our operations in California are particularly exposed to increased regulatory risks given the stringent environmental regulations imposed on the oil and gas industry, and current political and social trends in California continue to increase limitations on and impose additional permitting, mitigation, and emissions control obligations, amongst others, upon the oil and gas industry. We cannot predict what new laws or regulations governmental authorities within California (or the federal government) may impose upon our operations in the future; however, any such future laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. For additional information about the potential impact that government regulations, including those regarding environmental matters, may have upon our business, operations, capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, please see Part I, Item 1 Regulatory Matters, as well as Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report. 
 Permitting 
 Over the last few years, a number of developments at both the California state and local levels have resulted in significant delays in the issuance of permits to drill new oil and gas wells in Kern County, where all of our California assets are located, as well as a more time- and cost-intensive permitting process. The issuance of permits and other approvals for drilling and production activities by state and local agencies or by federal agencies are subject to environmental reviews under the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA and/or the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA ), respectively. The requirement to demonstrate compliance with CEQA and/or NEPA is currently resulting in (and in the future may result in) significant delays in the issuance of permits to drill new wells, as well as the potential imposition of mitigation measures and restrictions on proposed oil field operations, among other things. Before an operator can pursue drilling operations in California, they must first obtain permission to engage in oil and gas land use. CEQA requires the reviewing state and local agencies to consider the environmental impacts of the proposed oil and gas operations for permitting decisions. Historically, we satisfied CEQA by complying with the Kern County zoning ordinance for oil and gas operations, which was supported by the Kern County Environmental Impact Report EIR ). However, the Kern County EIR was legally challenged in 2015 and the use of the Kern County EIR is currently stayed and has been stayed for lengths of time throughout the litigation. Most recently, the Kern County EIR was stayed in January 2023 by a California appellate court while they reviewed the November 2022 ruling by the lower court that reinstated the Kern County EIR; since that time, operators have been unable to use the Kern County EIR to demonstrate CEQA compliance as required to receive permits to drill new wells. In March 2024, the California appellate court delivered its opinion finding certain deficiencies in the Kern County EIR and the reliance on the EIR remains enjoined until those deficiencies are remedied. Accordingly, our ability to rely on the Kern County EIR to demonstrate CEQA compliance to obtain permits and approvals to drill new wells is constrained unless and until Kern County is able to favorably resolve the litigation and certify a new revised EIR that the Court deems fully complies with CEQA. In the meantime, to obtain permits for drilling new wells in Kern County we must demonstrate compliance with CEQA to CalGEM through means other than the Kern County EIR. Berry does have a separate environmental impact analysis covering certain assets, and we have received permits to drill new wells in the covered areas. In fact, in May 2024, we received 13 permits to drill new wells, which we are executing on in 2024 and 2025. We are currently exploring a number of alternative permitting strategies for new drill permits to meet future needs; however, we cannot guarantee that any of these strategies will ultimately be successful. Importantly, the litigation impacting the Kern County EIR does not restrict the issuance of sidetrack and workover permits, and we have continued to receive the necessary permits to meet our production goals. Although in the latter part of 2023 and into 2024, we did experience some delays in the issuance of sidetrack and workover permits due to changes in CalGEM s CEQA review process. CalGEM is now processing applications on a more timely basis and permits are being issued on a more predictable timeline. We have completed our 2024 planned drilling activities and currently have sufficient permits in hand to support remaining 2024 activity and also support activity into 2025, including for new wells, sidetracks and workovers. Based on permits in hand and assuming the current permitting regime continues, we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy of holding production relatively flat in 2025, as we have for the last six years. However, it is possible that permit approval delays could adversely impact operations in 2025 and beyond and the inability to secure permits (on a timely basis or at all) could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

On August 26, 2024, CalGEM approved a final rule to prohibit permitting of well stimulation treatments (which includes hydraulic fracturing), which became effective on October 1, 2024. Although we do rely on other methods to stimulate production, such as cyclic and continuous steam injection, we currently do not perform any hydraulic fracturing in California and our near term plans do not include the development of assets requiring hydraulic fracturing. See Part I, Item 1 and 2. Business and Properties Regulatory Matters Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry in our Annual Report, as well as Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report for more information regarding the EIR and other permitting considerations. 
 
 Approximately 95 of our production in 2023 came from our base production, with the remainder from 33 wells drilled in California during the year (5 new wells and 28 sidetracks), workovers and other activities related to existing wellbores, and production acquired from the Macpherson Acquisition, which closed in September 2023. Similar to 2023, our 2024 plans focus on drilling sidetracks and working over existing wells, as well as drilling some of the new wells approved by CalGEM in May 2024. Our goal of maintaining consistent production levels from 2023 to 2024 will also benefit from production from the assets acquired in the Macpherson Acquisition and other smaller bolt-on acquisitions in the second quarter of 2024, as well as production from the Utah Horizontal farm-in well interests. We have in hand all the permits needed to support our 2024 plans and activity into 2025, and we are in the process of obtaining the additional permits needed to support our 2025 plans. 
 Setbacks SB 1137 
 Separately, on September 16, 2022, the California Governor signed into law SB 1137 to be effective January 1, 2023, which prohibits CalGEM from permitting any new wells, or the rework of existing wells, if the proposed new drill or rework is within 3,200 feet of certain sensitive receptors such as homes, schools or parks. Additional provisions of SB 1137, include, among others, the imposition of HSE controls applicable to wells located within the setback areas related to noise, light, and dust pollution controls and air emission monitoring, and the immediate suspension of operations at production facilities determined not to be in compliance with certain air emission requirements. However, in December 2022, proponents of a voter referendum (the Referendum collected more than the number of signatures required to put SB 1137 on the November 2024 ballot. On February 3, 2023, the Secretary of State of California certified the signatures and confirmed that the Referendum qualified for the November 2024 ballot and SB 1137 was stayed pending a vote of the California General Election in November 2024. However, in June 2024, the ballot proposal was withdrawn with the proposal s sponsors instead indicating a view to challenging SB 1137 in court. The provisions of SB 1137 became effective immediately in June 2024. Then on September 30, 2024, the Governor signed into law AB 218, which delays the deadline for some compliance with CalGEM s regulations implementing SB 1137 until July 1, 2026 and further delays compliance with certain other requirements of SB 1137 by up to three years. 
 Certain of our undeveloped costs are located within the setbacks established by SB 1137, which required an analysis of impairment as of the date the law became effective. Accordingly, following SB 1137 s immediate effectiveness in June 2024, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax asset impairment charge of 44 million, 33 million after-tax on unproved oil and gas properties in certain California locations during the second quarter of 2024. The impairment represents approximately 2 of the gross cost basis of our total oil and natural gas properties. See Note 10 Oil and Natural Gas Properties to the Financial Statements. 
 We do not expect this law to result in any material change to our overall existing proved developed producing reserves or current production rates. The majority of our production is in rural areas in the San Joaquin basin and is unlikely to be affected by SB 1137 as supplemented by AB 218. Approximately 13 of our production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was within setback zones and subject to SB 1137 s requirements. 
 Following the passage of AB 218 in September 2024 which extended the deadline for certain compliance requirements of SB 1137, all wells and facilities within a setback must be in compliance with specific health, safety and environmental requirements pursuant to SB 1137 by July 1, 2026, with leak detection and response plans developed and submitted to CalGEM for agency approval by July 1, 2028. CalGEM must approve these plans by July 1, 2029 and, beginning on July 1, 2030, operators are required to suspend operations within setback areas unless 
 30 

Table of Contents 

they have a CalGEM-approved leak detection and response plan that has been fully implemented. This plan must be updated every five years, and operators must annually report on implementation of these plans as well as the results of baseline water quality testing. While we are still assessing the impact and additional costs associated with compliance with SB 1137, the impact and costs are expected to be immaterial. 
 Local Ordinances AB 3233 
 On September 25, 2024, the California Governor signed Assembly Bill 3233 (AB 3233) into law, which explicitly authorizes local governments to limit methods for, or even prohibit, oil and gas operations or development within its jurisdiction, including with respect to existing operations. This legislation specifically was passed in response to a prior California Supreme Court decision that found limits on the authority of local governments to regulate oil and gas operations on the basis of preemption because of existing state law providing CalGEM with sole authority to regulate the methods for oil and gas production. Certain jurisdictions within California, including Monterey and Los Angeles, had previously taken steps to limit oil and gas operations that were struck down by that now invalidated California Supreme Court decision and it is possible that they or other local governments in California may pass similar legislation following AB 3233. We currently only operate in Kern County and at this time we are not aware of any local governments within Kern County that would seek to materially limit or otherwise prohibit oil and gas operations within its jurisdiction. However, it is difficult to predict how local governments in California may choose to exercise their new authority under AB 3233. While there may be future legal challenges to AB 3233 and any local ordinances enacted thereunder, we cannot predict whether or not such challenges will be successful, or if AB 3233 or any ordinances enacted pursuant to it will be stayed pending the outcome of such challenges. Notwithstanding any potential claims for regulatory takings we may have in the event local jurisdictions seek to prohibit any of our existing operations, any restrictions that materially limit or prohibit oil and gas production in the areas where we operate could materially impact our operations and financial condition. 
 Other Legislation 
 The potential exists for additional federal, state, and local legislation in the future that could adversely impact our operations. For example, in 2023, a legislator introduced Senate Bill No. 556 (SB 556) into the California Senate in 2023, providing for joint and several liability for operators and owners of an entity that owns an oil and gas production facility for certain adverse health conditions in a setback zone, subject to limited defenses. SB 556 also provided for civil penalties to be assessed against potentially responsible parties. Although this bill died during the last legislative session, similar bills could be introduced in the future. Another example is Assembly Bill 2716 (AB 2716), signed into law by the California Governor on September 25, 2024, that requires the plugging and abandonment of certain low-production wells located within the boundary of the Baldwin Hills Conservancy within a certain timeframe or otherwise subjects operators to administrative penalties. Although AB 2716 is indicative of the state of California s interest in accelerating the plugging and abandonment of low-production wells, this law is limited in scope to only certain wells within the Baldwin Hills Conservancy, which encompasses the Inglewood Oil Field. We do not currently operate any wells in the Inglewood Oil Field and, as such, this legislation will not impact our existing operations. 
 
 Assembly Bill 1167 (AB 1167), signed into law by the California Governor in October 2023 and effective as of January 1, 2024, imposes stringent financial assurance requirements on persons who acquire the right to operate a well or production facility in the state of California, which are more significant than those in effect for existing operators. Specifically, AB 1167 requires such persons to fulfill bonding requirements in an amount determined by the CalGEM to sufficiently cover full plugging and abandonment costs, decommissioning and site restoration of all wells and production facilities. Transfer of operatorship of a well or production facility is prohibited until CalGEM has determined the appropriate bond amount and the bond has been filed. Upon signing AB 1167, the California Governor called for further legislative changes to the new requirements to mitigate the potential risk of an increase in the number of orphaned wells becoming state liabilities following the implementation of the law.

In April 2019, CalGEM issued updated idle well management that include a comprehensive well testing regime to demonstrate the mechanical integrity of idle wells, a compliance schedule for testing or plugging and abandoning idle wells, the collection of data necessary to prioritize testing and/or plugging idle wells, an engineering analysis for each well idled 15 years or longer, and requirements for active observation wells. These idle well regulations require operators to plug and abandon idle wells under two programs: operators are required to either submit annual idle well management plans describing how they will plug and abandon or reactivate a specified percentage of long-term idle wells or pay additional annual fees and perform additional testing to retain greater flexibility to return long-term idle wells to service in the future. Assembly Bill 1866 (AB 1866), signed into law by the California Governor on September 25, 2024 and effective January 1, 2025, sets forth either (a) increased annual fees for operators of idle wells depending on how long each well has been idle or (b) in lieu of payment of the annual fee, operators can instead file a plan with the state that provides for the management and elimination of all idle wells, with consideration shown to a number of specified factors when prioritizing idle wells for testing or plugging and abandonment. CalGEM is in the process of implementing the provisions of AB 1866, so we are unable to fully assess the potential impact at this time. However, based on our preliminary assessment, we expect the impact to our plugging and abandoning costs to be minimal. 
 
 In October 2023, the California Governor signed two bills that require quantitative and qualitative climate disclosures for certain public and private companies doing business in California. Senate Bill 253 (SB 253) requires that the California Air Resources Board CARB develop and adopt regulations to require the annual disclosure of Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, with certain emissions data subject to third party assurance. The bill requires disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions beginning in 2026 for the 2025 reporting year and disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions beginning in 2027 for the 2026 reporting year. SB 253 would be effective for public and private companies with total annual revenues exceeding 1 billion and that do business in California. Senate Bill 261 (SB 261) requires biennial disclosures posted on a company s website related to climate-related financial risks and the measures a company has adopted to reduce and adapt to such risks. The bill requires disclosure of the climate-related financial risk disclosures beginning in 2026 for the 2025 reporting year. SB 261 is effective for public and private companies with total annual revenues exceeding 500 million. Both SB 253 and 261 have been challenged in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Further, on September 27, 2024, the California Governor amended both SB 253 and SB 261 by signing into law Senate Bill 219 (SB 219). SB 219 extends the time in which CARB has to promulgate implementing regulations for SB 253 until July 1, 2025, a delay of six months, but does not otherwise change the reporting deadlines in SB 253 or SB 261. 
 
 In July 2024 the California Governor signed a bill that limits the use of California net operating losses NOLs ). The legislation suspended the use of the California NOL deduction for corporate taxpayers with California net income or modified adjusted gross income of 1 million or more for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2027. We determined that the legislation does not currently impact the carrying value of and ability to ultimately utilize our California NOLs before their expiration, but there could be a future impact to our carrying value and ability to utilize our California NOLs. 
 
 Inflation 
 The U.S. inflation rate has become more significant in recent years. The Company, similar to other companies in our industry, has experienced inflationary pressures on our costs namely inflationary pressures have resulted in increases to the costs of our goods, services and personnel, which in turn, have caused our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Such inflationary pressures have resulted from supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, increased demand, labor shortages and other factors, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. During the first half of 2024, inflation rates have continued their trend of stabilizing as seen in the latter half of 2023. We are unable to accurately predict if such inflationary pressures and contributing factors will continue through the remainder of 2024. However, as of September 30, 2024, we determined there have not been any material changes in inflationary pressures since the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Seasonality 
 Seasonal weather conditions have in the past, and in the future likely will, impact our drilling, production and

well servicing activities. Extreme weather conditions can pose challenges to meeting well-drilling and completion objectives and production goals. Seasonal weather can also lead to increased competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delayed operations. Our operations have been, and in the future could be, impacted by ice and snow in the winter, especially in Utah, and by electrical storms and high temperatures in the spring and summer, as well as by wildfires and rain. 
 We seek to mitigate a substantial portion of the gas purchase exposure for our cogeneration plants by selling excess electricity from our cogeneration operations to third parties at prices linked to the price of natural gas. Aside from the impact gas prices have on electricity prices, these sales are generally higher in the summer months as they include seasonal capacity amounts. In the third quarter of 2024, gas prices increased slightly from prices in the second quarter of 2024. Our hedging strategy coupled with our midstream access to gas from the Rockies helps us mitigate the impact of high natural gas prices on our cost structure. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total capital expenditures were approximately 26 million and 85 million, respectively, including capitalized overhead and interest and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement spending. E P and corporate expenditures were 25 million and 83 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively (which excludes well servicing and abandonment capital of less than 1 million and 2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively). Approximately 75 and 25 of these capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were directed to California and Utah operations, respectively. During the first nine months of 2024 we drilled 40 wells in California and four vertical wells in Utah, as well as four non-operated horizontal wells in Utah of which our working interest is approximately 21 . 
 Our 2024 capital expenditure budget for E P operations, CJWS and corporate activities is expected to be between 95 to 110 million, which, if executed fully, we expect to result in meeting our goal of delivering 2024 production consistent with 2023. We currently anticipate oil production will be approximately 93 of total production volume in 2024, substantially consistent with 2023. Total capital expenditures were approximately 73 million in 2023, after reallocating 35 million from planned capital expenditures to fund a portion of the Macpherson Acquisition which closed in September 2023. Our 2024 E P capital program focuses primarily on drilling sidetracks and the workovers of existing well in California, and was prepared on the assumption that we would not receive permits to drill new wells in 2024 given the permitting delays we were experiencing at the time. We later modified our plans to include drilling some of the new wells approved by CalGEM in May 2024. Reflected in our 2024 E P capital program is our expectation that results will also benefit from a full year of production from the Macpherson Acquisition, as well as from production from the additional working interests acquired in December 2023 and the second quarter of 2024, and the Utah horizontal farm-in well interests which came online in June 2024. Our E P drilling activities have essentially been completed for the year and we expect full year capital expenditures to be within the provided range. Based on current commodity prices and our drilling success rate to date, we expect to be able to fund the remainder of our 2024 capital development programs from cash flow from operations. We currently have sufficient permits in hand to support our remaining planned activities for the the year and to support drilling and workover activities into 2025. Please see Regulatory Matters in this Quarterly Report, as well as in our Annual Report, for additional discussion of the laws and regulations that impact our ability to drill and develop our assets, including those impacting regulatory approval and permitting requirements. 
 Exclusive of the capital expenditures noted above, for the full year 2024, we currently plan to spend approximately 13 million to 17 million on plugging and abandonment activities, most of which is planned to meet our annual obligation requirements under California s idle well regulations. In 2023, we spent 18 million on plugging and abandonment activities, most of which was in compliance with California idle well regulations. We spent approximately 4 million and 10 million for plugging and abandonment activities in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 For information about the potential risks related to our capital program, see Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors in our Annual Report, as well as Regulatory Matters.

 Our average daily production decreased 2 , or 0.5 mboe/d, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Our California production was 20.1 mboe/d for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 5 or 1.0 mboe/d from the second quarter of 2024, partially due to the timing of adding new wells to production in our Midway Sunset field. These wells were put on-line at the end of the third quarter which increased our exit rate production. The decrease was also due to temporarily reduced steam injection in the Midway Sunset field which was restored by the end of the quarter. Utah production increased 0.5 mboe/d mostly due to our recent investment in four non-operated wells which began production in June 2024. 
 
 Our average daily production decreased 2 , or 0.5 mboe/d, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Lower 2024 production in California was primarily due to lower production from the Midway Sunset field, discussed above, partially offset by production from the Macpherson Acquisition in the third quarter of 2023. Utah production was consistent year-over-year due to mid-year 2024 development which included our recent investment in the four non-operated wells described above.

 (1) The well servicing and abandonment segment provides services to our E P segment. Prior to the intercompany elimination, service revenue was approximately 31 million and 37 million and the intercompany elimination was 5 million and 6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Revenues and Other 
 Oil, natural gas and NGL sales decreased by 14 million, or 8 , to approximately 154 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was driven by a 12 million decrease in oil prices and a 2 million decrease in oil volumes. 
 Service revenue consisted entirely of revenue from the well servicing and abandonment business, excluding intercompany amounts. Service revenue decreased 6 million or 18 to 25 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was due to lower rates and activity in the third quarter. 
 Electricity sales represent sales to utilities and increased 1 million to 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to higher operating rates for our cogeneration facilities. 
 Gain or loss on oil and gas sales derivatives consists of settlement gains and losses and mark-to-market gains and losses. Our settlement loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was 3 million and 10 million, respectively. This quarter-over-quarter decrease in settlement loss was primarily due to lower Brent settlement prices, the index for all our oil derivatives. The mark-to-market non-cash gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 78 million compared to a gain of 4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024. Because we are the floating price payer on these swaps, generally, period to period decreases (increases) in the associated price index create valuation gains (losses).

 Expenses 
 Lease operating expenses, which do not include the effects of gas purchase hedges, increased 2 or 1 million to 55 million for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2024. This increase was the result of higher natural gas (fuel) costs of 2 million for our California steam generation facilities due to a 19 increase in fuel prices. Lease operating expenses excluding fuel decreased 1 million due to lower well service and maintenance activity. 
 Costs of services consisted entirely of costs from the well servicing and abandonment business, excluding intercompany amounts. Cost of services decreased 2 million, or 8 , to 23 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to cost savings in response to lower activity. 
 Electricity generation expenses increased approximately 1 million due to higher operating rates for our cogeneration facilities and higher fuel prices for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Transportation expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 1 million, slightly higher than for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to higher processed volumes. 
 Gains and losses on natural gas purchase derivatives resulted in a loss of 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a loss of 3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Settlements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were a loss of 7 million, or 3.28 per boe, and a loss of 9 million, or 4.05 per boe, respectively. The decrease was due to higher settlement prices relative to the fixed price in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. The mark-to-market valuation loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was less than 1 million compared to a gain of 7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Because we are the fixed price payer on these natural gas swaps, generally, period to period increases (decreases) in the associated price index create valuation gains (losses). 
 Acquisition costs declined in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to reduced activity and include legal and other professional expenses related to various transaction activities. 
 General and administrative expenses was unchanged at 19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses included 2 million non-cash stock compensation costs, compared to 2 million non-cash stock compensation costs for three months ended June 30, 2024. We had approximately 1 million of non-recurring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and no non-recurring costs for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, which excludes non-cash stock compensation expense and non-recurring costs, were slightly lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of general and administrative expenses, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses. 
 DD A was flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties 
 There was no impairment of oil and gas properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Impairment of oil and gas properties was 44 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Other Operating (Income) Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other operating income was 5 million and mainly consisted of a gain on CJWS property sold of approximately 5 million in addition to a loss on material and equipment sales of approximately 1 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, other operating income was 3 million and mainly consisted of prior period royalty receipts and property tax refunds. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to lower working capital borrowings on the RBL Facility. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 28 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The rate in both periods included the impact of state taxes and certain permanent items which were not deductible for tax purposes. The rate in the third quarter of 2024 also included the generation of new tax credits.

Gain or loss on oil and gas sales derivatives consists of settlement gains and losses and mark-to-market gains and losses. Settlement losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 3 million and 12 million, respectively. The decrease in settlement losses was driven by lower oil prices relative to our derivative fixed prices in the third quarter of 2024 than those of the same period in 2023. Notional volumes were 15 mbbl/d in the third quarter of 2024 and 14 mbbl/d in the third quarter of 2023. The mark-to-market non-cash gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 78 million compared to a loss of 91 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Because we are the floating price payer on these swaps, generally, period to period decreases (increases) in the associated price index create valuation gains (losses).

Expenses 
 Lease operating expenses, which do not include the effects of gas purchase hedges, decreased 8 or 5 million to 55 million for the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was the result of 8 million lower natural gas (fuel) costs for our California steam generation facilities mainly due to a decline in fuel price and lower volumes purchased, as a result of our cost savings initiatives to reduce steam. These decreases were partially offset by a 3 million increase in non-fuel lease operating expense from higher power, company labor, and well servicing costs. 
 Cost of services (excluding intercompany amounts) decreased 13 million, or 36 , to 23 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to cost savings in response to lower activity. 
 Electricity generation expenses declined slightly due to lower fuel purchase prices for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Transportation expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 1 million, slightly higher than for the same period in 2023, mostly due to higher natural gas processing costs. 
 Gains and losses on natural gas purchase derivatives for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, resulted in a loss of 8 million and a gain of 8 million, respectively. Settlement loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was unchanged at 7 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The mark-to-market non-cash loss was less than 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a gain of 16 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. Because we are the fixed price payer on these natural gas swaps, generally, period to period increases (decreases) in the associated price index create valuation gains (losses). 
 Acquisition costs decreased 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to reduced activity, and include legal and other professional expenses related to various transaction activities. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 2 million or 9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 general and administrative expenses had 2 million in non-cash stock compensation expense compared to 3 million for September 30, 2023. We incurred approximately 1 million in non-recurring costs for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and non-recurring costs were slightly lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of general and administrative expenses, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses. 
 DD A increased 3 million, or 8 , to 43 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in depletion rates.

 Taxes, other than income taxes decreased 41 to 4.54 per boe for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.73 per boe for the three months ended September 30, 2023. GHG allowance expense decreased due to lower emissions and lower mark-to-market prices in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in ad valorem and property taxes was due to increased property valuations, as well as the additional properties acquired in 2023. 
 Other Operating (Income) Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other operating income was 5 million and mainly consisted of a gain on CJWS property sold of approximately 5 million in addition to a loss on material and equipment sales of approximately 1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, other income was not material. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was flat in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was approximately 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 25 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The rate in both periods included the impact of state taxes and certain permanent items which are not deductible for tax purposes. The rate in the third quarter of 2024 also included the generation of new tax credits.

 (1) The well servicing and abandonment segment provides services to our E P segment. Prior to the intercompany elimination, service revenue was approximately 103 million and 143 million and the intercompany elimination was 15 million and 5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Revenues and Other 
 Oil, natural gas and NGL sales decreased 7 million, or 1 , to 490 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The variance was driven by a 13 million decrease in gas sales (mostly lower prices), partially offset by a 4 million increase in oil prices, and a 2 million increase in oil volumes. 
 Service revenue (excluding intercompany amounts) decreased 50 million, or 36 , to 88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower activity and rates. 
 Electricity sales, which represent sales to utilities were flat at 12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain or loss on oil and gas sales derivatives consists of settlement gains and losses and mark-to-market gains and losses. Settlement losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, were 17 million and 22 million, respectively. The period-over-period decrease in settlement losses was driven by a narrower spread between the settled derivative fixed prices and index oil prices in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to that of the same period in 2023. The mark-to-market non-cash gain was 16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a loss of 22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Because we are the floating price payer on these swaps, generally, period to period decreases (increases) in the associated price index create valuation gains (losses).

 Expenses 
 Lease operating expenses, which do not include the effects of gas purchase hedges, decreased 32 , or 80 million, on an absolute dollar basis to 169 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to an 89 million decrease in natural gas (fuel) costs for our California steam generation facilities, 84 million of which was from a decline in fuel prices, and 5 million from a decline in fuel volumes. Lease operating expenses excluding fuel increased 9 million due to higher power costs, company labor, and well servicing activity. 
 Cost of services (excluding intercompany amounts) decreased 34 million, or 31 , to 75 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to cost savings in response to lower activity. 
 Electricity generation expenses decreased 2 million to 3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to lower fuel prices and volumes. Fuel costs included in electricity generation expenses exclude the effects of natural gas derivative settlements.

Table of Contents 

Gains and losses on natural gas purchase derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, consisted of 15 million and 5 million losses, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the natural gas settlement price was less than the fixed price of settled positions which resulted in a settlement loss of 21 million, compared to the same period in 2023 when the natural gas settlement price was greater than the fixed prices of settled positions and resulted in a settlement gain of 37 million. The mark-to-market valuation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a gain of 6 million compared to a loss of 42 million for the same period in 2023 when futures prices were lower relative to our derivative fixed prices. Because we are the fixed price payer on these natural gas swaps, generally, period to period increases (decreases) in the associated price index create valuation gains (losses). 
 Transportation expenses were comparable for the periods presented. 
 Acquisition costs increased 2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and include legal and professional expenses related to various transaction activities. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 17 million, or 23 , to approximately 58 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses included non-cash stock compensation costs of approximately 4 million and 11 million, respectively. We incurred non-recurring costs of 2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred non-recurring costs of 9 million, which were related to executive transition costs, workforce reduction costs, and shareholder litigation expenses for the same period in 2023. 
 Adjusted general and administrative expenses, which exclude non-cash stock compensation costs and non-recurring costs, decreased 3 million to 52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to lower employee- related costs, resulting from cost savings initiatives implemented in the first quarter of 2024. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of general and administrative expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses. 
 DD A increased 9 million, or 7 , to 128 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased depletion rates. 
 Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties 
 Impairment of oil and gas properties was 44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was no impairment of oil and gas properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Taxes, other than income taxes decreased 8 to 5.61 per boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.12 per boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. GHG allowance expense decreased due to lower non-cash mark-to-market prices for the allowances compared to the same period in 2023. Ad valorem taxes increased due to additional wells coming online and additional properties acquired in 2023. Severance taxes increased due to an increase in the California conservation tax rate, partially offset by utilization of Utah tax credits. 
 Other Operating (Income) Expenses 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other operating income was 8 million and mainly consisted of a 5 million gain on property sold for CJWS, a 1 million gain on prior period royalty receipts, and a 1 million gain on property tax refunds, partially offset by a loss on material and equipment sales of approximately 1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other operating income was 2 million and mainly consisted of net property tax refunds from prior periods and a net gain on equipment sales. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 2 million, or 9 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of higher borrowings on the RBL Facility in 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was approximately 26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The rate for both periods included the impact of state taxes and certain permanent items which are not deductible. The rate in 2024 also included the generation of new tax credits. 
 E P Field Operations 
 Overall, management assesses the efficiency of our E P field operations by considering core E P operating expenses together with our cogeneration, marketing and transportation activities. In particular, a core component of our E P operations in California is steam, which we use to lift heavy oil to the surface. We operate several cogeneration facilities to produce some of the steam needed in our operations. In comparing the cost effectiveness of our cogeneration plants against other sources of steam in our operations, management considers the cost of operating the cogeneration plants, including the cost of the natural gas purchased to operate the facilities, against the value of the steam and electricity used in our E P field operations and the revenues we receive from sales of excess electricity to the grid. We strive to minimize the variability of our fuel gas costs for our California steam operations with natural gas purchase hedges. Consequently, the efficiency of our E P field operations are impacted by the cash settlements we receive or pay from these derivatives. We also have contracts for the transportation of fuel gas from the Rockies which has historically been cheaper than the California markets. With respect to transportation and marketing, management also considers opportunistic sales of incremental capacity in assessing the overall efficiencies of E P operations. 
 Lease operating expenses include fuel, labor, field office, vehicle, supervision, maintenance, tools and supplies, and workover expenses. Electricity generation expenses include the portion of fuel, labor, maintenance, and tools and supplies from two of our cogeneration facilities allocated to electricity generation expense; the remaining cogeneration expenses are included in lease operating expense. Transportation expenses relate to our costs to transport the oil and gas that we produce within our properties or move it to the market. Marketing expenses mainly relate to natural gas purchased from third parties that moves through our gathering and processing systems and then is sold to third parties. Electricity revenue is from the sale of excess electricity from two of our cogeneration facilities to a California utility company under long-term contracts at market prices. These cogeneration facilities are sized to satisfy the steam needs in their respective fields, but the corresponding electricity produced is more than the electricity that is currently required for the operations in those fields. Transportation sales relate to water and other liquids that we transport on our systems on behalf of third parties and marketing revenues represent sales of natural gas purchased from and sold to third parties.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of either net income (loss) or cash flow, Free Cash Flow is not a measure of cash flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a measure of net income (loss), and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses is not a measure of general and administrative expenses, in all cases, as determined by GAAP. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion, and amortization; derivative gains or losses net of cash received or paid for scheduled derivative settlements; impairments; stock compensation expense; and unusual and infrequent items. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and is widely used by the industry and the investment community. The measure also allows our management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results between periods without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in planning our capital expenditure allocation to sustain production levels and to determine our strategic hedging needs aside from the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL Facility and 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
 We define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We use Free Cash Flow as the primary metric to measure our ability to pay dividends, pay down debt, repurchase stock, and make strategic growth and bolt-on acquisitions. Management believes Free Cash Flow may be useful in an investor analysis of our ability to generate cash from operating activities from our existing oil and gas asset base after capital expenditures and to fund such activities. Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance, and it should not be inferred that the entire amount of Free Cash Flow is available for dividends, debt repayment, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities, or other discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure. 
 We previously reported Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, and made allocations of Adjusted Free Cash Flow in accordance with a structured shareholder return model that we implemented in January 2022, and most recently provided as follows: (a) 80 primarily in the form of debt repurchases, stock repurchases, strategic growth, and acquisitions of producing bolt-on assets; and (b) 20 in the form of variable dividends. However, in October 2024, in anticipation of entering into the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, we transitioned to a more flexible approach to capital allocation that aligns with the covenants contained in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement and prioritizes debt reduction while facilitating our operating strategy and enabling investment in development opportunities. For a discussion and presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the prior period, see our previous filings with the SEC. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for derivative gains or losses net of cash received or paid for scheduled derivative settlements, unusual and infrequent items, and the income tax expense or benefit of these adjustments using our statutory tax rate. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excludes the impact of unusual and infrequent items affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably, including non-cash items such as derivative gains and losses. This measure is used by management when comparing results period over period. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors because it reflects how management evaluates the Company s ongoing financial and operating performance from period-to-period after removing certain transactions and activities that affect comparability of the metrics and are not reflective of the Company s core operations. We believe this also makes it easier for investors to compare our period-to-period results with our peers. 
 We define Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as general and administrative expenses adjusted for non-cash stock compensation expense and unusual and infrequent costs. Management believes Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses is useful because it allows us to more effectively compare our performance from period to 
 51 

Table of Contents 

period. We believe Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses is useful to investors because it reflects how management evaluates the Company s ongoing general and administrative expenses from period-to-period after removing non-cash stock compensation, as well as unusual or infrequent costs that affect comparability of the metrics and are not reflective of the Company s administrative costs. We believe this also makes it easier for investors to compare our period-to-period results with our peers. 
 While Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses are non-GAAP measures, the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses were computed in accordance with GAAP. These measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than income and liquidity measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance, such as our cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had liquidity of 104 million, consisting of 9 million cash, 88 million available for borrowings under our 2021 RBL Facility and 7 million available for borrowings under our 2022 ABL Facility (as defined below). Based on current commodity prices and our development success rate to date, we expect to be able to fund the remainder of our 2024 capital development programs with cash flow from operations. 
 We review the allocations of our Free Cash Flow from time to time based on then existing conditions and circumstances, including our earnings, financial condition, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors. In January 2022, we introduced a structured shareholder return model to guide our allocation of Free Cash Flow, which most recently provided as follows: (a) 80 primarily in the form of debt repurchases, stock repurchases, strategic growth, and acquisitions of producing bolt-on assets; and (b) 20 in the form of variable dividends. However, in October 2024, in anticipation of entering into the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, we transitioned to a more flexible approach to capital allocation that prioritizes debt reduction and aligns with the covenants contained in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, while facilitating our operating strategy and enabling investment in development opportunities. 
 Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance, and it should not be inferred that the entire amount of Free Cash Flow is available for variable dividends, debt or share repurchases, strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities, or other discretionary expenditures, since we have non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Management s Discussion and Analysis Non-GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of operating cash flow, our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow. 
 The 2021 RBL Facility matures in August 2025, and our 2026 Notes mature in February 2026. In conjunction with the closing of the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Company expects to repay in full and terminate the 2022 ABL Facility and the 2021 RBL Facility, as well as redeem the 2026 Notes. We may not be successful in refinancing, repaying or extending the maturity of our 2026 Notes or our 2021 RBL Facility, and any such refinancing may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding amount on the 2021 RBL Facility is classified as current debt, and we expect to have sufficient sources of liquidity to pay this obligation when it comes due. Management s ongoing assessment of the Company s ability to repay its obligations under its credit agreements as they come due could result in a going concern qualification with respect to our annual audited financial statements. 
 We currently believe that our liquidity, capital resources, cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to conduct our business and operations and meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. In the longer term, if oil prices were to significantly decline and remain weak, we may not be able to continue to generate the same level of Free Cash Flow we are currently generating and our liquidity and capital resources may not be sufficient to conduct our business and operations until commodity prices recover. Please see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report for a discussion of known material risks, many of which are beyond our control, that could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

Senior Unsecured Notes 
 In February 2018, Berry LLC completed a private issuance of 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0 senior unsecured notes due February 2026, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately 391 million after deducting expenses and the initial purchasers discount. 
 The 2026 Notes are Berry LLC s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior indebtedness and senior to any of our subordinated indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Berry Corp and certain of its subsidiaries. C J and C J Management do not guarantee the 2026 Notes. 
 The indenture governing the 2026 Notes contains customary covenants and events of default (in some cases, subject to grace periods). We were in compliance with all covenants under the 2026 Notes as of September 30, 2024. 
 In conjunction with and subject to the closing of the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement discussed below, the Company is required to redeem the 2026 Notes. This report does not constitute a notice of redemption of the 2026 Notes. 
 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement 
 Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024, but before the issuance date of these financials, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, Breakwall Credit Management LLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for aggregate commitments equal to 545 million, consisting of (i) an initial term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 450 million (the Initial Term Loans ), and (ii) a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 95 million which is available from the date of the first borrowing of the Initial Term Loans (the Funding Date until the date that is two years after the effectiveness of the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Working Capital Term Loan Facility ). The ability of the Company to borrow under the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, including to refinance the 2026 Notes, 2021 RBL Facility, and the 2022 ABL Facility, is subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent, as further set forth in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, including (a) the repayment and termination of liens under each of the 2021 RBL Facility and 2022 ABL Facility and (b) satisfaction and discharge of the 2026 Notes. The proceeds of the Initial Term Loans are limited in their use to the satisfaction and discharge of existing debt, payment of fees and expenses in connection with the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement and other related transactions, capital expenditures in accordance with the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, working capital, and other general corporate purposes. A requirement of funding the Initial Term Loans is (a) the contemporaneous termination of the 2022 ABL Facility and the 2021 RBL Facility, including satisfaction and discharge of any remaining balances thereon and (b) the satisfaction and discharge of the 2026 Notes. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement will have an initial maturity date of three years from the Funding Date, which may be extended by up to two-one year increments subject to payment of extension fees, and satisfaction of certain other customary conditions. Quarterly debt service payments of an amount equal to the sum of 2.5 of (a) the face value of the Initial Term Loan and (b) the aggregate amount of delayed draws made from the Working Capital Term Loan Facility are required beginning in March 2025. 
 Loans under the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin of 7.50 . If an Event of Default (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement) exists and is continuing, upon the election of the Majority Lenders (as defined in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement) under the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, or automatically without such election, in the case of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or payment default, all amounts outstanding under the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement will bear interest at 2.00 per annum above the rate and margin otherwise applicable thereto (it being understood that the Majority Lenders may elect for the application of default interest to commence on any date that is on or after the occurrence of such Event of Default while such 
 59 

Table of Contents 

Event of Default is continuing). The Company will be able to repay any amounts borrowed prior to the maturity date (i) without any premium for any optional prepayment on or prior to the date that is 24 months after the Funding Date and (ii) thereafter, subject to a concurrent payment of 2.75 of the principal amount being repaid. 
 On the Funding Date, the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement will be guaranteed by the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and will be secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement allows the Company to replace the commitments and outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Term Loan Facility with a super-priority reserve based credit facility of up to 95 million (the New RBL Facility ), subject to terms and conditions set forth therin, including the entry by the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company party thereto into of an intercreditor agreement, as more fully described in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including (a) minimum liquidity of 25 million as of the last day of any calendar month and (b) commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025, (i) a total net leverage ratio that may not exceed 2.5 to 1.0 and (ii) an asset coverage ratio that may not be less than 1.3 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, in each case, as fully more described in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
 Additionally, the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement contains additional restrictive covenants that (i) from and after the effective date thereof, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, pay dividends or prepay other debt, make investments and loans, enter into mergers and acquisitions, and sell assets, and (ii) from and after the Funding Date, will limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness (with such exceptions including the New RBL Facility), incur additional liens, enter into certain hedging transactions, engage in transactions with affiliates and make certain capital expenditures. 
 In addition, the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement is subject to customary events of default, including a change in control (which change of control event of default is subject to a carve-out for no decline in the Company s corporate credit rating). If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent or the majority lenders may accelerate any amounts outstanding and terminate lender commitments and exercise remedies against any collateral. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement became effective on November 6, 2024 (the Closing ). 
 Hedging 
 We have protected a significant portion of our anticipated cash flows through our commodity hedging program, including swaps, puts, calls and collars. We hedge crude oil and gas production to protect against oil and gas price decreases and we also hedge gas purchases to protect against price increases. We have also entered into gas transportation contracts in the Rockies to help reduce the price fluctuation exposure, however these do not qualify as hedges. 
 In addition, we also hedge to meet the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL Facility and will have similar hedging requirements under out 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement. The 2021 RBL Facility requires us to maintain commodity hedges (other than three-way collars), with floor prices no less than 80 of the then prevailing market price at the time such hedging agreement is entered into, on minimum notional volumes of (i) at least 75 of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each full calendar month during the period from and including the first full calendar month following each April 1 and October 1 of each calendar year after the effective date of the 2021 RBL Facility through and including the 24th full calendar month following each such April 1 and October 1 and (ii) at least 50 of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each full calendar month during the period from and including the 25th full calendar month following each April 1 and October 1 of each calendar year after the effective date of the 2021 RBL Facility through and including the 36th full calendar month following each April 1 and October 1; provided, that in the case of each of the above clauses (i) and (ii), the notional volumes hedged are deemed reduced by the notional volumes of any short 
 60 

Table of Contents 

puts or other similar derivatives having the effect of exposing us to commodity price risk below the floor. 
 In addition to minimum hedging requirements and other restrictions in respect of hedging described therein, the 2021 RBL Facility contains restrictions on our commodity hedging which prevent us from entering into hedging agreements (i) with a tenor exceeding 60 months or (ii) for notional volumes which (when aggregated with other commodity hedges then in effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged) exceed, as of the date such hedging agreement is executed, 90 of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each month following the date such hedging agreement is entered into, provided that such volume limitations do not apply to, among other things, short puts or long put options contracts that are not related to corresponding calls, collars, or swaps. 
 The 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement requires us to maintain commodity hedges in the form of the hedges existing as of the effective date of the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, fixed price swaps (at market prices), costless collars, certain other collars meeting conditions described in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and put options, on minimum notional volumes of (i) at least 75 of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each full calendar month during the period from and including the first full calendar month on a quarterly basis after the Funding Date of the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement through and including the 24th full calendar month following the relevant minimum hedging test date and (ii) at least 50 of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each full calendar month during the period from and including the 25th full calendar month following the relevant minimum hedging test date after the Funding Date of the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement through and including the 36th full calendar month following such minimum hedging testing date. In addition, the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement requires us to maintain hedges in respect of purchases of natural gas for fuel in respect of 40,000 million British thermal units of natural gas for fuel for each day (a) during the 18 month calendar month period immediately following the Funding Date and (b) during the 18 month calendar month period commencing with the end of the next upcoming month after the applicable minimum hedging test date. 
 In addition to minimum hedging requirements and other restrictions in respect of hedging described therein, the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement contains restrictions on our commodity hedging which prevent us from entering into hedging agreements (i) with a tenor exceeding 60 months or (ii) for notional volumes which (when aggregated with other commodity hedges then in effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged) exceed, as of the date such hedging agreement is executed, 90 of our reasonably projected production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, calculated separately, from our PDP reserves, for each month following the date such hedging agreement is entered into, provided, that, the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement provides that the Company may enter into additional commodity hedges pertaining to oil and gas properties to be acquired, subject to the requirements set forth in the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
 Our generally low-decline production base affords an ability to hedge a material amount of our future expected production. We expect our operations to generate sufficient cash flows at current commodity prices including our current hedging positions. For information regarding risks related to our hedging program, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Operations and Industry in our Annual Report.

Cash Dividends 
 In the first quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors declared a fixed cash dividend of 0.12 per share, as well as a variable cash dividend of 0.14 per share which was based on the results of the fourth quarter of 2023, for a total of 0.26 per share, which we paid in March 2024. In April 2024, the Board of Directors approved a fixed cash dividend totaling 0.12 per share, which was paid in May 2024. In July 2024, the Board of Directors approved a fixed cash dividend of 0.12 per share and a variable cash dividend of 0.05 per share, based on the results for the six months ended June 30, 2024, for a total of 0.17 per share, which was paid in August 2024. These variable dividends were paid in accordance with our shareholder return model, which allocated 20 of Adjusted Free Cash Flow to the payment of variable dividends. 
 In October 2024, in anticipation of entering the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement, we transitioned away from the previously established shareholder return model to a more flexible approach to capital allocation, which among other things prioritizes the repayment of debt. Accordingly, we suspended the quarterly variable dividend. Additionally, the Board of Directors determined it was appropriate to reduce the quarterly fixed dividend to 0.03 per share, reflecting the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement requirements and the desire to deploy capital to development opportunities, amongst other priorities. The fixed dividend is payable on November 25, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2024. 
 The following table represents the regular fixed cash dividends on our common stock and variable dividends approved by our Board of Directors in 2024. 
 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter 
 Year-to-Date Fixed Dividends 0.12 0.12 0.03 0.27 Variable Dividends (1)

 (1) Variable dividends have been declared the quarter following the period of results. There is no variable dividend related to the results of the third quarter of 2024. The table reflects total dividends earned in each quarter. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 The Company did not repurchase any shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of 11.9 million shares, cumulatively, under the stock repurchase program for approximately 114 million in aggregate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining total share repurchase authority approved by the Board of Directors was 190 million. The Board of Directors authorization permits the Company to make purchases of its common stock from time to time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, subject to market conditions and other factors, up to the aggregate amount authorized by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors authorization has no expiration date. 
 The manner, timing and amount of any purchases will be determined based on our evaluation of market conditions, stock price, compliance with outstanding agreements and other factors. Purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice and the share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase shares during any period or at all. Any shares repurchased are reflected as treasury stock and any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes.

Statements of Cash Flows 
 
 The following is a comparative cash flow summary: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash: Provided by operating activities 168,859 119,639 Used in investing activities (85,649) (126,450) Used in financing activities (78,574) (22,239) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 4,636 (29,050) 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 49 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The i ncrease was primarily related to a decrease in lease operating expenses, lower general and administrative expenses (from lower payroll costs) and lower executive transition costs, and lower taxes, other than income costs, partially offset by an increase in derivatives settlements paid, a decrease in net margin from CJWS and a decrease in unhedged revenue. 
 Investing Activities 
 The following provides a comparative summary of cash flows from investing activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) 
 Capital expenditures: 
 Capital expenditures (85,135) (56,124) Changes in capital expenditures accruals 1,219 (10,431) Acquisitions, net of cash received (9,188) (59,895) Proceeds from sale of property and equipment and other 7,455 Net cash used in investing activities 
 (85,649) (126,450) 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased 41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower acquisition activity in 2024 and cash proceeds from the sale of CJWS storage facility in Ventura, California, offset by increased capital expenditures in 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities increased approximately 56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the deferred consideration payment for the Macpherson Acquisition, increased repayments on the 2021 RBL credit facility, and an increase in debt issuance costs, partially offset by a decrease in dividends paid.

Balance Sheet Analysis 
 The changes in our balance sheet from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 are discussed below. 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 9,471 4,835 Accounts receivable, net 74,542 86,918 Derivative instruments assets - current and long-term 22,110 10,751 Other current assets 35,539 43,759 Property, plant equipment, net 1,337,275 1,406,612 Deferred income taxes asset - long-term 27,378 30,308 Other noncurrent assets 10,833 10,975 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 144,186 213,401 Derivative instruments liabilities - current and long-term 10,740 Current portion of long-term debt, net 27,500 Long-term debt, net 398,000 427,993 Deferred income taxes liability - long-term 4,264 2,344 Asset retirement obligations - long-term 178,329 176,578 Other noncurrent liabilities 32,660 5,126 Stockholders equity 732,209 757,976 
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions about the changes in cash and cash equivalents. 
 The 12 million decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to decreased oil and gas sales and service revenue between the two ending periods. 
 The 8 million decrease in other current assets was primarily due to prepaid expense amortization, as well as reduction of materials inventory. 
 The 69 million decrease in property, plant and equipment was primarily due to year-to-date changes in accumulated depreciation of 119 million, and 44 million in impairment, offset by 85 million in capital investments and 9 million in acquisitions. 
 The 3 million decrease in net deferred income taxes assets - long term, which includes the deferred tax liability, was primarily due to the utilization of federal NOL and credit carryforwards. 
 The 69 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses includes decreased greenhouse gas liability, final payment for the acquisition of Macpherson Energy made in July 2024, decreased fuel gas purchases (based on lower fuel gas price) since year end, decreased obligations for royalties payable between the two ending periods, and decreased interest payable, offset by an increase in taxes other than income taxes. 
 The 22 million increase in net derivative assets, which includes the derivative liability, is due to change in the derivative values and positions at the end of each period. Changes to mark-to-market derivative values at the end of each period result from differences in the forward curve prices relative to the contract fixed prices, changes in positions held and settlements received and paid throughout the periods. 
 The 28 million increase in the current portion of the long-term debt, net reflects a reclass of the 2021 RBL Facility from long-term debt, net based on its maturity date. 
 The 30 million decrease in long-term debt, net largely reflected the reclassification of the current portion. 
 66 

Table of Contents 

The 2 million increase in deferred income taxes liability - long-term is due to the tax effect of accelerated tax deductions. 
 The 2 million increase in the long-term portion of the asset retirement obligations from 177 million at December 31, 2023 to 178 million at September 30, 2024 was due to 9 million of accretion expense and 2 million in liabilities incurred, largely offset by 9 million of liabilities settled during the period. 
 The 28 million increase in ot her noncurrent liabilities is primarily due to the obligations for greenhouse gas allowances incurred in 2024 which are due in over one year. 
 The 26 million decrease in stockholders equity was due to 47 million of common stock dividends, and 5 million of shares withheld for payment of taxes on equity awards, offset by 21 million in net income and 5 million of stock-based compensation. 
 
 Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, and Contingencies 
 In the normal course of business, we, or our subsidiaries, are the subject of, or party to, pending or threatened legal proceedings, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters that seek, or may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, false claims, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, fines and penalties, remediation costs, or injunctive or declaratory relief. 
 We accrue for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. We have not recorded any reserve balances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We also evaluate the amount of reasonably possible losses that we could incur as a result of these matters. We believe that reasonably possible losses that we could incur in excess of accruals on our balance sheet would not be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 We, or our subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specific liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with transactions that they have entered into with us. As of September 30, 2024, we are not aware of material indemnity claims pending or threatened against us. 
 Securities Litigation Matters 
 In November 2020, a putative securities class action (the Securities Class Action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, claiming that Berry Corp. and certain of its current and former directors and officers violated the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934 by allegedly making false and misleading statements between the IPO and November 3, 2020, and in the IPO offering materials, about the Company s permits and permitting processes. 
 While the motion for class certification was still pending before the court, the parties reached an agreement-in-principle to settle all claims in the Securities Class Action for an aggregate sum of 2.5 million. Following notice to the class and an opt-out and objection process, the Court granted final approval of the settlement on February 6, 2024, and terminated the case. The Defendants continue to maintain that the claims were without merit and admitted no liability in connection with the settlement. 
 While the Securities Class Action is now concluded, certain related shareholder derivative actions remain pending. On October 20, 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit (the Assad Lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas by putative stockholder George Assad, allegedly on behalf of the Company, that piggy-backs on the Securities Class Action and is currently pending before the same court. The derivative complaint names certain current and former officers and directors as defendants, and generally alleges that they breached their fiduciary duties by causing or failing to prevent the securities violations alleged in the Securities Class Action. The derivative complaint also alleges claims for unjust enrichment as against all defendants, and claims for contribution and indemnification under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act. On January 27, 2023, the court granted the parties joint stipulated request to stay the Assad Lawsuit pending resolution of the Securities Class Action.

Table of Contents 

On January 20, 2023, a second shareholder derivative lawsuit (the Karp Lawsuit, together with the Assad Lawsuit, the Shareholder Derivative Actions was filed, this time in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, by putative stockholder Molly Karp, allegedly on behalf of the Company, again piggy-backing on the Securities Class Action. This complaint, similar to the Assad Lawsuit, is brought against certain current and former officers and directors of the Company, asserting breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and contribution claims based on the defendants allegedly having caused or failed to prevent the securities violations alleged in the Securities Class Action. In addition, the complaint asserts a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, alleging that Berry s 2022 proxy statement was false and misleading in that it suggested the Company s internal controls were sufficient and the Board of Directors was adequately overseeing material risks facing the Company when, according to the derivative plaintiff, that was not the case. On February 13, 2023, the court granted the parties joint stipulated request to stay the Karp Lawsuit pending further developments in the Securities Class Action. 
 
 The settlement of the Securities Class Action did not resolve the Shareholder Derivative Actions, which remain pending. The defendants continue to believe the claims in the Shareholder Derivative Actions are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against them, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome. At this time, we are unable to estimate the probability or the amount of liability, if any, related to these matters. 
 
 In addition, on or around April 17, 2023, the Company received a stockholder litigation demand that the Board of Directors investigate and commence legal proceedings against certain current and former officers and directors based ostensibly on the same claims asserted in the Shareholder Derivative Actions. The Board of Directors appointed a Demand Review Committee for the purpose of reviewing the demand.

 (2) Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on a discounted basis. We do not show the long-term asset retirement obligations by year as we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgements that are subject to revisions based on numerous factors, including the rate of inflation, changing technology, and changes to federal, state and local laws and regulations.

(3) These commitments and contractual obligations are expected to be funded by our cash flow from operations. 
 (4) Amounts include payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure pipeline transportation of natural gas to market and between markets. 
 (5) We have entered into contracts to purchase GHG compliance instruments totaling 22 million, of which 6 million will be delivered and paid in the fourth quarter 2024. The approximate remaining amount of 16 million of these instruments will be delivered and paid in 2025. 
 (6) As of September 30, 2024, we have a total drilling commitment in California of 17.1 million. We are required to drill 57 wells consisting of 28 wells by December 2024 and the remaining 29 wells by June 2025.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in the information required to be provided under Item 305 of Regulation S-K included in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report, except as discussed below. 
 Price Risk 
 Our most significant market risk relates to prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Management expects energy prices to remain unpredictable and potentially volatile. As energy prices decline or rise significantly, revenues, certain costs such as fuel gas, and cash flows are likewise affected. Additional non-cash impairment charges for our oil and gas properties may be required if commodity prices experience significant decline. 
 We have historically hedged a large portion of our expected crude oil and our natural gas production, as well as our natural gas purchase requirements to reduce exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We use derivatives such as swaps, calls, puts and collars to hedge. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes and we have not accounted for our derivatives as cash-flow or fair-value hedges. We continuously consider the level of our oil production and gas purchases that is appropriate to hedge based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, current and future expected commodity prices, our expected capital and operating costs, our overall risk profile, including leverage, size and scale, as well as any requirements for, or restrictions on, levels of hedging contained in any credit facility or other debt instrument applicable at the time. 
 We determine the fair value of our oil and gas sales and natural gas purchase derivatives and emission allowances required by California s cap-and-trade program using valuation techniques which utilize market quotes and pricing analysis. Inputs include publicly available prices and forward price curves generated from a compilation of data gathered from third parties. We validate data provided by third parties by understanding the valuation inputs used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain situations and confirming that those instruments trade in active markets. 
 At September 30, 2024, the fair value of our hedge positions was a net asset of approximately 22 million. A 10 increase in the oil and natural gas index prices above the September 30, 2024 prices would result in a net liability of approximately 75 million; conversely, a 10 decrease in the oil and natural gas index prices below the September 30, 2024 prices would result in a net asset of approximately 120 million. For additional information about derivative activity, see Note 3 Derivatives in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. 
 At September 30, 2024, the fair value of our emission allowances required by California s cap-and-trade program was 28 million. A 10 increase or decrease in the market price would result in a change in expense by approximately 3 million. 
 Actual gains or losses recognized related to our derivative contracts depend exclusively on the price of the underlying commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts. Additionally, we cannot be assured that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts. If a counterparty fails to perform and the derivative arrangement is terminated, our cash flows could be negatively impacted.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer supervised and participated in our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, they each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings in the normal course of business, the ultimate resolutions of which, in the opinion of management, are not anticipated to have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. 
 Securities Litigation Matter 
 In November 2020, a putative securities class action (the Securities Class Action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, claiming that Berry Corp. and certain of its current and former directors and officers violated the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934 by allegedly making false and misleading statements between the IPO and November 3, 2020, and in the IPO offering materials, about the Company s permits and permitting processes.

 The recent definitive implementation of SB 1137 to restrict the production of oil and gas in certain setback areas is expected to negatively impact our reserves and could result in decreased demand for fossil fuels within the states where we operate. 
 In September 2022, the Governor of California signed into law SB 1137 which prohibits CalGEM from permitting any new wells, or the rework of existing wells, if the proposed new drill or rework is within 3,200 feet of certain sensitive receptors such as homes, schools or parks, originally effective as of January 1, 2023. Additional provisions of SB1137, include, among others, the imposition of HSE controls applicable to wells located within the setback areas related to noise, light, and dust pollution controls and air emission monitoring, and the immediate suspension of operations at production facilities determined not to be in compliance with certain air emission requirements. However, in December 2022, proponents of a voter referendum (the Referendum collected more than the number of signatures required to put SB 1137 on the November 2024 ballot. On February 3, 2023, the Secretary of State of California certified the signatures and confirmed that the Referendum qualified for the November 2024 ballot and SB 1137 was stayed pending a vote of the California General Election in November 2024. However, in June 2024, the ballot proposal was withdrawn with the proposal s sponsors instead indicating a view to challenging SB 1137 in court. Accordingly, the provisions of SB 1137 went into immediate effect in June 2024. Then on September 30, 2024, the Governor signed into law AB 218, which delayed the deadline for compliance with CalGEM s regulations implementing SB 1137 until July 1, 2026 and further delays compliance with certain other requirements of SB 1137 by up to three years. See Part II, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Regulatory Matters Setbacks SB 1137 in this Quarterly Report. 
 As a result of the June 2024 effectiveness of SB 1137 s permitting restrictions, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax asset impairment charge of 44 million 33 million after-tax) on unproved oil and gas properties in certain California locations during the second quarter of 2024. The impairment represents approximately 2 of our total oil and natural gas properties. The majority of our production is in rural areas in the San Joaquin basin and is unlikely to be affected by SB 1137 as supplemented by AB 218. Approximately 13 of our production for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was within setback zones subject to SB 1137 and subject to these requirements. We do not expect this law to result in any material change to our overall existing proved developed producing reserves or current production rates. See Note 10 Oil and Natural Gas Properties to the Financial Statements.

 Following the passage of AB 218 in September 2024 which extended the deadline for certain compliance requirements of SB 1137, all wells and facilities within a setback must be in compliance with specific health, safety and environmental requirements pursuant to SB 1137 by July 1, 2026, with leak detection and response plans developed and submitted to CalGEM for agency approval by July 1, 2028. CalGEM must approve these plans by July 1, 2029 and, beginning on July 1, 2030, operators are required to suspend operations within setback areas unless they have a CalGEM-approved leak detection and response plan that has been fully implemented. This plan must be updated every five years, and operators must annually report on implementation of these plans as well as the results of baseline water quality testing. We cannot predict CalGEM s timeline for approving these plans, whether CalGEM will require more stringent mitigation in connection with final approval of such plans, or whether circumstances may arise in the future that could adversely impact production within setback zones. Additionally, failure to comply with the requirements of SB 1137 may result in enforcement action and the imposition of substantial fines and penalties. While we are still assessing the impact and additional costs associated with compliance with SB 1137, the impact and costs are expected to be immaterial. 
 We may face increased local restrictions on oil and gas exploration and production operations or even be prohibited from operating in certain areas as a result of recently enacted California legislation. 
 On September 25, 2024, the California Governor signed Assembly Bill 3233 (AB 3233) into law, which explicitly authorizes local governments to limit methods for, or even prohibit, oil and gas operations or development within its jurisdiction, including with respect to existing operations. This legislation specifically overrides a prior California Supreme Court decision that found limits on the authority of local governments to regulate oil and gas operations on the basis of preemption because of existing state law providing CalGEM with sole authority to regulate the methods for oil and gas production. Certain jurisdictions within California, including Monterey and Los Angeles, had previously taken steps to limit oil and gas operations that were struck down by that now invalidated California Supreme Court decision and it is possible that they or other local governments in California may pass similar legislation following AB 3233. We currently only operate in Kern County and at this time we are not aware of any local governments within Kern County that to seek to materially limit or otherwise prohibit oil and gas operations within its jurisdiction. However, it is difficult to predict how local governments in California may choose to exercise their new authority under AB 3233. While there may be future legal challenges to AB 3233 and any local ordinances enacted thereunder, we cannot predict whether or not such challenges will be successful, or if AB 3233 or any ordinances enacted pursuant to it will be stayed pending the outcome of such challenges. Notwithstanding any potential claims for regulatory takings we may have in the event local jurisdictions seek to prohibit any of our existing operations, any restrictions that materially limit or prohibit oil and gas production in the areas where we operate could materially impact our operations and financial condition. 
 We may not be successful in refinancing, repaying or extending the maturity of our 2026 Notes or our 2021 RBL Facility, and any such refinancing may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us. 
 The 2021 RBL Facility matures on August 26, 2025 and the 2026 Notes mature on February 15, 2026. The 2021 RBL Facility is classified as current debt on our balance sheet, and if we are not able to refinance the 2026 Notes, the 2026 Notes will be classified as current debt as of February 15, 2025. Management s ongoing assessment of the Company s ability to repay the 2021 RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes upon maturity could result in a going concern qualification with respect to our annual audited financial statements. Although we have entered into the 2024 Term Loan Credit Agreement which provides for commitments that we may use to refinance the 2026 Notes and the 2021 RBL Facility, we may not be able to borrow under such commitments if a condition precedent to funding is not satisfied or if the lenders thereunder default under their commitments. As a result, we may be unable to repay the 2021 RBL Facility or the 2026 Notes on their respective maturity dates and could be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or raise additional equity capital or seek bankruptcy protection.

 82 

Table of Contents 

 Proved developed producing reserves means reserves that are being recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. 
 Proved reserves means the estimated quantities of oil, gas and gas liquids, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 Proved undeveloped drilling location means a site on which a development well can be drilled consistent with spacing rules for purposes of recovering proved undeveloped reserves. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves or PUDs means proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 
 PSUs means performance-based restricted stock units 
 PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and gas reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10 per annum to reflect the timing of future cash flows and using SEC-prescribed pricing assumptions for the period. While this measure does not include the effect of income taxes as it would in the use of the standardized measure calculation, it does provide an indicative representation of the relative value of the company on a comparative basis to other companies and from period to period. 
 QF means qualifying facility. 
 Realized price means the cash market price less all expected quality, transportation and demand adjustments. 
 Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence. For a complete definition of reasonable certainty, refer to the SEC s Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a)(24). 
 Recompletion means the completion for production from an existing wellbore in a formation other than that in which the well has previously been completed. 
 Relative TSR means relative total stockholder return. 
 Reserves means estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir or negative test 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 
 Reservoir means a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible natural gas and/or oil that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 
 Resources means quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. 
 Royalty means the share paid to the owner of mineral rights, expressed as a percentage of gross income from oil and natural gas produced and sold unencumbered by expenses relating to the drilling, completing and operating of the affected well. 
 Royalty interest means an interest in an oil and natural gas property entitling the owner to shares of oil and natural gas production, free of costs of exploration, development and production operations. 
 RSUs is an abbreviation for restricted stock units. 
 SEC Pricing means pricing calculated using oil and natural gas price parameters established by current guidelines of the SEC and accounting rules based on the unweighted arithmetic average of oil and natural gas prices as of the first day of each of the 12 months ended on the given date. 
 Seismic Data means data produced by an exploration method of sending energy waves into the earth and recording the wave reflections to indicate the type, size, shape and depth of a subsurface rock formation. 2-D seismic provides two-dimensional information and 3-D seismic provides three-dimensional views. 
 SOFR is an abbreviation for Secured Overnight Financing Rate. 
 Spacing means the distance between wells producing from the same reservoir. Spacing is often expressed in terms of acres, e.g., 40-acre spacing, and is often established by regulatory agencies. 
 Steamflood means cyclic or continuous steam injection. 
 Standardized measure means discounted future net cash flows estimated by applying year-end prices to the estimated future production of proved reserves. Future cash inflows are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on period-end costs to determine pre-tax cash inflows. Future income taxes, if applicable, are computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of pre-tax cash inflows over our tax basis in the oil and natural gas properties. Future net cash inflows after income taxes are discounted using a 10 annual discount rate. 
 Stimulating means mechanically inducing a crack or surface of breakage within rock not related to foliation or cleavage in metamorphic rock in order to enhance the permeability of rocks by connecting pores together. 
 Strip Pricing means pricing calculated using oil and natural gas price parameters established by current guidelines of the SEC and accounting rules with the exception of pricing that is based on average annual forward-month ICE (Brent) oil and NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas contract pricing in effect on a given date to reflect the market expectations as of that date. 
 Superfund is a commonly known term for CERCLA. 
 UIC is an abbreviation for the Underground Injection Control program. 
 84 

Table of Contents 

 Unconventional resource plays means a resource play that uses methods other than traditional vertical well extraction. Unconventional resources are trapped in reservoirs with low permeability, meaning little to no ability for the oil or natural gas to flow through the rock and into a wellbore. Examples of unconventional oil resources include oil shales, oil sands, extra-heavy oil, gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids. 
 Undeveloped acreage means lease acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. 
 Unit means the joining of all or substantially all interests in a reservoir or field, rather than a single tract, to provide for development and operation without regard to separate property interests. Also, the area covered by a unitization agreement. 
 Unproved reserves means reserves that are considered less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Unproved reserves may be further sub-classified to denote progressively increasing uncertainty of recoverability and include probable reserves and possible reserves. 
 Wellbore means the hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for natural resource production on a completed well. Also called well or borehole. 
 Working interest means an interest in an oil and natural gas lease entitling the holder at its expense to conduct drilling and production operations on the leased property and to receive the net revenues attributable to such interest, after deducting the landowner s royalty, any overriding royalties, production costs, taxes and other costs. 
 Workover means maintenance on a producing well to restore or increase production. 
 WST is an abbreviation for well stimulation treatment. 
 WTI means West Texas Intermediate.

 (b) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that this Section 10.03 may not be relied on for purposes of calculating any financial ratios or other conditions or compliances other than the financial covenant set forth in Section 9.01 and shall not result in any adjustment to any amounts other than the amount of Consolidated EBITDAX or the amount of Total Net Debt, in each case, referred to in Section 10.01(a) above for purposes of determining the Borrower s compliance with Section 9.01 . To the extent a Covenant Cure Payment is applied to increase Consolidated EBITDAX or decrease Total Debt, as applicable, such Covenant Cure Payment shall only be taken into account in connection with the calculations of the applicable covenant 
 139 

contained in Section 9.01 as of a particular fiscal quarter end and any subsequent calculations of such covenants which contain such particular fiscal quarter as part of its trailing twelve month period or trailing four quarter period. 
 (c) In each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, there shall be at least two (2) fiscal quarters in which no cure set forth in this Section 10.03 is made.

 (c) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender under any Loan Document with respect to any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, against any amount that the Administrative Agent has demanded to be returned under immediately preceding clause (a) .

 (e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including, without limitation, any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. 
 Each party s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 11.13 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the applicable Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

In connection with any such bid, (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties' ratable interests in the Indebtedness which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any Disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Majority Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Majority Lenders contained in Section 12.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Indebtedness which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Indebtedness that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of the Indebtedness assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Indebtedness credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Indebtedness shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their original interest in such Indebtedness and the equity interests and or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Indebtedness shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Indebtedness of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable law and except for and subject to any limitations in connection with any applicable termination or release of a Guarantor s obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of Section 13.09 , the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to exercise or enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement (iii) the release of, or the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the exchange, substitution, release or any impairment of, any security held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for the Guaranteed Obligations (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations (v) any other act or omission that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of a Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) (vi) any illegality, lack of validity or enforceability of any Guaranteed Obligation (vii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Credit Party, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any Guaranteed Obligation (other than the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) (viii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights that a Guarantor may have at any time against any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent, or any other corporation or Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing herein will prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim and (ix) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party that might otherwise constitute a defense to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the Borrower or any other 
 170 

Credit Party or any other guarantor or surety. Each Guarantor expressly authorizes the applicable Secured Parties to take and hold security for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in their sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, all without affecting the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of liability of any other Guarantor, other than the Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or non-judicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Borrower or any other Credit Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Borrower or any other Credit Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of such Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations has been made. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any security. 
 Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and, to the extent permitted by Law, all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that any Secured Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against the Borrower under this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor waives, to the extent permitted by law, any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured Party upon the Guaranty pursuant to this Article XIII or acceptance of the Guaranty pursuant to this Article XIII , and the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon the Guaranty pursuant to this Article XIII , and all dealings between the Borrower and the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the Guaranty pursuant to this Article XIII . The Guaranty pursuant to this Article XIII shall be construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time or from time to time held by Secured Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other person at any time of any right or remedy against the Borrower or against any other person which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. The Guaranty pursuant to this Article XIII shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders, 
 171 

and their respective successors and assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding. 
 Section XIII.3 Reinstatement. 
 The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article XIII shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or other Credit Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. 
 Section XIII.4 No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. 
 Each Guarantor agrees that, as between such Guarantor and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, if any, may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 10.02 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Section 10.02 for purposes of Section 13.01 , notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 13.01 . No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent in exercising any right, power, privilege or remedy hereunder with respect to the obligations of the Guarantors shall operate as a waiver hereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The rights, powers, privileges and remedies of the Administrative Agent hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies provided by applicable Law. No waiver of any provision of this Guaranty or consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by this Section 13.04 , and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the funding of any Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle any Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. When making any demand hereunder against any of the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower or any other Guarantor or guarantor, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Guarantor or guarantor or any release of the Borrower or such other Guarantor or guarantor shall not relieve any of the Guarantors in respect of which a demand or collection is not made or any of the Guarantors not so released of their several obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party against any of the 
 172 

Guarantors. For the purposes hereof demand shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings. 
 Section XIII.5 Instrument for the Payment of Money.

 Section XIII.6 Continuing Guaranty. 
 The guarantee in this Article XIII is a continuing guarantee of payment and performance, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. 
 Section XIII.7 General Limitation on Guarantees. 
 In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate limited partnership or limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of the Guarantors under Section 13.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 13.01 , then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by any Guarantor, any Credit Party or any other person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding. 
 Section XIII.8 Information. 
 Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Guaranty, and agrees that none of any Agent or any Lender shall have any duty to advise Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks. 
 Section XIII.9 Release of Guarantors. 
 If, subject to compliance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion), (i) all or substantially all of the Equity Interests of any Guarantor are sold or otherwise transferred (a Transferred Guarantor to a person or persons, none of which is a Credit Party or (ii) any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, such Transferred Guarantor or Immaterial Subsidiary shall, upon the consummation of such sale or transfer or subject to the delivery to the Administrative Agent of a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying as to matters the

 Upon Payment in Full, this Agreement and the guarantees made herein shall terminate with respect to all Indebtedness except with respect to any component of Indebtedness that expressly survive such repayment pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall, at each Guarantor s expense and request, take such actions as are reasonably requested to release any Collateral owned by such Guarantor in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Security Instruments. 
 Section XIII.10 Right of Contribution. 
 Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment.
