 million term loan (the Concentra term loan ), and a million revolving credit facility, including a million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit (the Concentra revolving credit facility and, together with the Concentra term loan, the Concentra credit facilities ). 
 Borrowings under the Concentra credit facilities are guaranteed by the Company and substantially all of the Company s current domestic subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by CHSI s future domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the Company s existing and future property and assets and by a pledge of the Company s capital stock, the capital stock of CHSI s domestic subsidiaries and up to of the capital stock of CHSI s foreign subsidiaries held directly by CHSI or a domestic subsidiary. 
 Borrowings under the Concentra credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to: (i) in the case of the Concentra term loan, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from to , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from to , in each case based on CHSI s leverage ratio; and (ii) in the case of the Concentra revolving credit facility, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from to , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from to , in each case based on CHSI s leverage ratio, as defined in the Concentra credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the term loan borrowings bear interest at . The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, the Company had million of availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 The Concentra term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments in amounts equal to of the aggregate original principal amount of the Concentra term loan commencing on December 31, 2024. The balance of the Concentra term loan will be payable on July 26, 2031. The Concentra revolving credit facility will mature on July 26, 2029. 
 The Concentra credit facilities require CHSI to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the Concentra credit agreement), which is tested quarterly and currently must not be greater than to 1.00. Failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and, absent a waiver or an amendment from the revolving lenders, preclude CHSI from making further borrowings under the Concentra revolving credit facility and permit the revolving lenders to accelerate all outstanding borrowings under the Concentra revolving credit facility. Upon termination of the commitments for the Concentra revolving credit facility and acceleration of all outstanding borrowings thereunder, failure to comply with the covenant also would constitute an event of default with respect to the Concentra term loan. 
 The Concentra credit facilities also contain a number of other affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on mergers, consolidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; investments and acquisitions; indebtedness; liens; affiliate transactions; and dividends and restricted payments. The Concentra credit facilities contain events of default for non-payment of principal and interest when due, cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions and an event of default that would be triggered by a change of control. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. 
 Prepayment of borrowings 
 CHSI will be required to prepay borrowings under the Concentra credit facilities with (i) of the net cash proceeds received from non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions, or as a result of a casualty or condemnation, subject to reinvestment provisions and other customary carveouts and, to the extent required, the payment of certain indebtedness secured by liens subject to a first lien intercreditor agreement if CHSI s total net leverage ratio is greater than to 1.00 and of such net cash proceeds if our total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00 and greater than to 1.00, (ii) of the net cash proceeds received from the issuance of debt obligations other than certain permitted debt obligations, and (iii) of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) if CHSI s leverage ratio is greater than to 1.00 and of excess cash flow if CHSI s leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00 and greater than to 1.00, in each case, reduced by the aggregate amount of term loans, revolving loans and certain other debt optionally prepaid (and, in the case of revolving loans, accompanied by a reduction in the related commitment) during the applicable fiscal year. CHSI will not be required to prepay borrowings with excess cash flow or the net cash proceeds of asset sales if CHSI s leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 1.00.

 million for professional malpractice liability insurance and million for general liability insurance. The Company s insurance for the professional liability coverage is written on a claims-made basis, and its commercial general liability coverage is maintained on an occurrence basis. These coverages apply after a self-insured retention limit is exceeded. Each of these programs has either a deductible or self-insured retention limit. The Company also maintains additional types of liability insurance covering claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by or not fully covered by the applicable professional malpractice and general liability insurance policies, including workers compensation, property and casualty, directors and officers, cyber liability, and employment practices liability insurance coverages. Our insurance policies generally are silent with respect to punitive damages so coverage is available to the extent insurable under the law of any applicable jurisdiction, and are subject to various deductibles and policy limits. The Company reviews its insurance program annually and may make adjustments to the amount of insurance coverage and self-insured retentions in future years. Significant legal actions, as well as the cost and possible lack of available insurance, could subject the Company to substantial uninsured liabilities.

 Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. You should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, our actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.

You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and you should not consider the risks described above to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as required by law.

 Regulatory Changes 
 Our Registration Statement contains a detailed discussion of the regulations that affect our business in the Government Regulations section. 
 
 Operating Metrics 
 Management utilizes specific key operating metrics to monitor trends and performance in our business and therefore may be important to investors because management may assess our performance based in part on such metrics. Other healthcare providers may present similar measures; however, these measures are susceptible to varying definitions and our key metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Patient Visits and Visits Per Day Volume 
 We monitor the number of patient visits per day VPD volume for each of our major service lines in our Occupational Health Center operating segment workers compensation services, employer services, and consumer health. Management believes that the number of patient visits is a critical indicator of the volume of services being provided in our centers. VPD volume, which is calculated as total patient visits in a given period divided by total business days for such period, allows for comparability between time periods with different number of business days. Patient visits and VPD volume include only the patients seen in our Occupational Health Centers operating segment and does not include our Onsite Health Clinics or Other Businesses operating segments. 
 Revenue Per Visit 
 Management also measures reimbursement rates utilizing patient revenue per visit which is calculated as total patient revenue divided by total patient visits. Revenue per visit as reported includes only the revenue and patient visits in our Occupational Health Centers operating segment and does not include our Onsite Health Clinics or Other Businesses operating segments.

 Revenue 
 Revenue increased 3.3 to 489.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 474.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by the increase in revenue per visit, as described below.

 Revenue per visit increased 3.9 to 141.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 136.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We experienced a higher revenue per visit principally due to increases in the reimbursement rates payable pursuant to certain state fee schedules for workers compensation visits, increases in our employer services rates, and a favorable mix of visit types by service line for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue per visit for workers compensation visits increased 2.7 to 202.29 from 197.05, revenue per visit for employer services visits increased 3.6 to 89.55 from 86.45 and revenue per visit for consumer health visits increased by 5.0 to 137.30 from 130.82, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 General and Administrative, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization 
 General and administrative expense includes corporate overhead such as finance, legal, human resources, marketing, facilities, and other administrative areas as well as executive compensation. Our general and administrative expenses were 37.1 million, or 7.6 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 38.2 million, or 8.1 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest expense on our related party debt with Select of 2.7 million, compared to 11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense is due to the payoff of the revolving promissory note with Select during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as discussed further in Note 1, Organization. 
 Interest Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest expense of 21.4 million, compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to the issuance of an 850.0 million term loan and 650.0 million senior notes in July 2024, as described in Note 6, Long-Term Debt . 
 Income Taxes 
 We recorded income tax expense of 16.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which represented an effective tax rate of 26.4 . We recorded income tax expense of 15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represented an effective tax rate of 21.8 . O ur income tax expense is computed based on annual estimates which we allocate throughout the year based on our income. This intra-period tax allocation may cause our effective tax rate to reflect variances when compared to the prior year as estimates of our annual income and the components of our income tax expense change throughout the year.

 Non-GAAP Information 
 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as defined below, are important to investors because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are commonly used as an analytical indicator of performance by investors within the healthcare industry. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used by management to evaluate financial performance of, and determine resource allocation for, each of our operating segments. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net income margin, income from operations, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying definitions, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain (loss) on early retirement of debt, stock compensation expense, separation transaction costs, gain (loss) on sale of businesses, and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We will refer to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin throughout the remainder of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA and net income margin to Adjusted EBITDA margin and should be referenced when we discuss Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 In the following table and analysis, we discuss cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 180,963 158,138 Net cash used in investing activities (54,579) (47,125) Net cash used in financing activities (20,936) (124,990) Net increase (decrease) in cash 105,448 (13,977) Cash at beginning of period 31,374 37,657 Cash at end of period 136,822 23,680 
 Operating activities provided 181.0 million and 158.1 million of cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulted from increased collections on our accounts receivable. 
 Investing activities used 54.6 million and 47.1 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the principal uses of cash were 47.6 million for purchases of property and equipment and 7.0 million for acquisitions of businesses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the principal uses of cash were 41.3 million for purchases of property and equipment and 4.4 million for purchases of customer relationships. 
 Financing activities used 20.9 million and 125.0 million of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the principal uses of cash were a 1,535.7 million dividend payment to Select and 470.0 million of net repayments on our related party revolving promissory note. The principal sources of cash were net proceeds from our term loans of 836.7 million, net proceeds from the issuance of our 6.875 senior notes of 637.3 million, and net proceeds from our initial public offering of 511.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the principal uses of cash were 120.0 million in payments on the related party revolving promissory note, principal payments on other debt of 5.8 million, and distributions to and purchases of non-controlling interests of 4.5 million, partially offset by 5.5 million in borrowings of other debt. 
 Capital Resources 
 We had net working capital of 140.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to net working capital of 19.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the net working capital surplus was principally due to increases in our cash and accounts receivable. 
 A significant component of our net working capital is our accounts receivable. Collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our liquidity and capital resources. Because our accounts receivable is primarily paid for by highly-solvent, creditworthy payors, such as workers compensation programs, employer programs, third party administrators, commercial insurance companies, and federal and state governmental authorities, our credit losses have historically been infrequent and insignificant in nature, and we believe the possibility of credit default is remote. 
 Credit Facilities 
 On July 26, 2024, CHSI entered into the Concentra credit agreement that provides for an 850.0 million term loan, and a 400.0 million revolving credit facility, including a 75.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. 
 Borrowings under the Concentra credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to: (i) in the case of the Concentra term loan, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from 2.00 to 2.25 , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from 1.00 to 1.25 , in each case based on CHSI s leverage ratio; and (ii) in the case of the Concentra revolving credit facility, Term SOFR plus a percentage ranging from 2.25 to 2.75 , or Alternate Base Rate plus a percentage ranging from 1.25 to 1.75 , in each case on CHSI s leverage ratio, as defined in the Concentra credit agreement.

Table of Contents 

 The Concentra term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments in amounts equal to 0.25 of the aggregate original principal amount of the Concentra term loan commencing on December 31, 2024. The balance of the Concentra term loan will be payable on July 26, 2031. The Concentra revolving credit facility will mature on July 26, 2029. 
 The Concentra credit facilities require CHSI to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the Concentra credit agreement), which is tested quarterly and currently must not be greater than 6.50 to 1.00. Failure to comply with this covenant would result in an event of default under the Concentra revolving credit facility, absent a waiver or amendment from the lenders. CHSI will be required to prepay borrowings under the Concentra credit facilities upon cash proceeds from asset sales or dispositions, issuance of additional debt obligations, and excess cash flows, further outlined in the credit agreement. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings under its term loan of 850.0 million (excluding unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs of 13.0 million). The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its revolving facility. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 386.4 million of availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to 13.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 6.875 Senior Notes 
 On July 11, 2024, the Company completed a private offering by its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Escrow Issuer, of 650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875 senior notes due July 15, 2032. On July 26, 2024, Escrow Issuer merged with and into CHSI, with CHSI continuing as the surviving entity, and CHSI assumed all of the Escrow Issuer s obligations under the senior notes. The Concentra senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Interest on the Concentra senior notes accrues at a rate of 6.875 per annum and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2025. 
 Use of Capital Resources 
 From time to time we intend to pursue continued organic growth within our existing occupational health centers and onsite health clinics at employer worksites and to take advantage of opportunities to continue to grow our footprint and base of customers via strategic acquisitions and the opening of new centers in key areas. Such strategic acquisitions may be funded from operating cash flows, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or other sources. 
 Liquidity 
 We believe our internally generated cash flows and borrowing capacity under our revolving facility will allow us to finance our operations in both the short and long term. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 136.8 million and 386.4 million of availability under the revolving facility after giving effect to 13.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the net proceeds of the IPO and the debt financing transactions, except for 34.7 million, were paid to Select through the issuance of a dividend and the repayment of promissory notes. 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, may be funded from operating cash flows or other sources and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Dividend 
 On October 28, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.0625 per share. The dividend will be payable November 22, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2024. 
 There is no assurance that future dividends will be declared. The declaration and payment of dividends in the future are at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, the Company s financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, the terms of the Company s indebtedness, and other factors the Company s Board of Directors may deem to be relevant.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Inflation Risk 
 The healthcare industry is labor intensive, and our largest expenses are labor related costs. Wage and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace. We have recently experienced higher labor costs related to the current inflationary environment and competitive labor market. In addition, suppliers have passed along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices. To help mitigate the inflationary pressures on our business, we have implemented compensation strategies, selective price increases in certain markets, supply chain optimization initiatives and carefully monitor labor costs in our day-to-day operations. However, if our costs continue to be subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to offset such higher costs through price increases, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our variable rate long-term indebtedness. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to the loans outstanding under our credit facilities, which bear interest rates that are indexed against Term SOFR. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities consisting of an 850.0 million term loan (excluding unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs of 13.0 million). We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. 
 At September 30, 2024, each 0.25 increase in market interest rates will impact the annual interest expense on our variable rate debt by 2.1 million per year. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered in this report. Based on this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including the accumulation and communication of disclosure to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be included in our periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the relevant SEC rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Use of Proceeds 
 On July 26, 2024, the Company completed the IPO, resulting in the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of its common stock at a price of 23.50 per share. In addition, the underwriters exercised the option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The 23,250,000 shares of common stock sold in the IPO represent approximately 18.26 of the Company s outstanding shares, of which Select owns 81.74 . 
 The shares sold in the offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 File No. 333-280242, which was declared effective by the SEC as of July 24, 2024. The aggregate offering price of common stock registered and sold under the registration statement was approximately 546.4 million (including shares issued pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares).
