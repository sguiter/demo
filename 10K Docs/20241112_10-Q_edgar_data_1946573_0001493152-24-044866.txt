to the principal amount at the IPO share price, and (ii) repayment of the principal and accrued interest in cash. The note contains customary
covenants and events of default for a loan of this type.

Revenues 

The Company earned 106,567 in reimbursements from
insurance payers during the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 16.4 increase compared to the 91,553 earned during
the three months ended June 30, 2024. The Company earned 232,842 in reimbursements from insurance payers during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and 0 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenues
decreased by 221,401, or 25.5 , to 647,867 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 869,268 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributed to a decrease in cash-pay patient care services as Kindly MD continues
to shift toward insurance billing with commercial and governmental payers including Medicare, Medicaid, Select Health, Blue Cross Blue
Shield, Cigna, and other commercial payers compared to the prior period.

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses increased by 316,820, or 22.9 , to 1,697,685 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,380,865 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following: 

1. 
 Salaries
 and wages increased by 143,483, or 14.4 , to 1,138,561 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 995,078 for the three
 months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in salaries and wages is primarily attributed to additional staffing labor for Enterprise Data Management infrastructure and increased labor for compliance and billing and coding costs as Kindly MD shifts to insurance billing with
 commercial and governmental payers. 

2. 
 General
 and administrative expenses increased by 186,199, or 54.8 , to 525,758 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 339,559
 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to increased
 professional fees and directors and officers insurance as a publicly traded company. 

3. 
 Cost
 of revenues decreased by 12,434, or 61.5 , to 7,790 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 20,224 for the three months
 ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenues is primarily attributed to the corresponding decline in product revenues
 and a reduction to the inventory reserve. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Net
other income increased by 39,220, or 1,105.1 , to 35,671 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from net other expense of 3,549
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net other income is primarily attributable to the following: 

1. 
 Other income increased by 36,329, or 403.6 , to 45,330 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9,001 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to interest income earned during the period. 

2. 
 Interest
 expense decreased by 2,891, or 23.0 , to 9,659 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 12,550 for the three months
 ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in interest expense is primarily attributed to a reduction of accrued interest of notes
 payable and amortization of debt discounts. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net loss was 1,014,147 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, compared to a net loss of 515,146 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
loss per share decreased by 0.06, or 54.5 , to (0.17) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (0.11) for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Kindly MD management strives to look for opportunities to optimize revenue by increasing sales, acquiring
additional clinics, improving margins, and controlling ongoing operating expenses.

Expenses 

Operating
expenses increased by 112,849, or 2.6 , to 4,440,091 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4,327,242 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to the following:

nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 128,356 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenues is
primarily attributed to the corresponding decline in product revenues and a reduction in our inventory reserve, which lowered the provisions
previously set aside for potential inventory obsolescence. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Net
other expenses increased by 317,546, or 1,242.5 , to 291,988 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from net other income of
 25,558 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net other expenses is primarily attributable to the following: 

1.

 ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to increased interest income earned on our bank accounts and income
 from affiliate programs and educational partnerships during the period. 

2. 
 Interest
 expense increased by 364,604, or 1,757.6 , to 385,348 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 20,744 for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense is primarily attributable to accrued interest
 of notes payable and amortization of debt discounts of 367,046. 

3.

 a result of the repayment and issuance of common shares upon settlement of notes payable in connection with a public offering IPO,
 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 38,889 and a gain on change
 in fair value of derivative liability of 61,051. 

Net
Loss 

As
a result of the cumulative effect of the factors described above, our net loss was 2,616,126 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 1,292,533 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
loss per share increased by 0.21 or 72.4 , to (0.50) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (0.29) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Management continues to look for opportunities to increase sales, acquire additional clinics, improve
margins, and control ongoing operating expenses. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3,642,944 and total working capital of 3,215,466. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an operating loss of 2,324,138 and used cash flows in operating activities of 2,172,361. 

To
date, we have financed our operations primarily through revenues generated from operations and cash proceeds from financing
activities. On June 3, 2024, the we completed an IPO through the issuance of common stock and warrants for total net proceeds of
 5.86 million. The IPO provided us with adequate liquidity and cash reserves to meet our obligations for at least the
12-month period following the date of this report, and to assist us in implementing our strategic operational business plans to create sustained
cash flow generation thereafter.

Net
cash used in operating activities was 2,172,361 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 240,806 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of an increased net loss, stock based compensation, and prepaid
expenses during the period. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 13,291 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14,420 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributed to decreased property and equipment expenditures
during the period. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 5,303,096 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 219,553 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributed to the 5.9 million
of net proceeds received in the public offering, offset by repayments of notes payable. 

As
a result of these cash flow activities, our net cash increased by 3,117,444, or 593.2 , from 525,500 as of December 31, 2023, to 3,642,944
as of September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of these condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of
and during the reported period of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate our estimates
and assumptions on an ongoing basis. 

Use
of Estimates. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,
at the date of and during the reported period of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate
our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. 

Revenue
Recognition. The Company records revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Revenue is
recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following
five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3)
determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize
revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. 

The
Company primarily recognizes revenue from: (i) patient care services related to medical evaluation and treatment and (ii) product retail
sales, (iii) service affiliate agreements 

Revenue
from patient care services, which relates to medical evaluation and treatment, is reported at the amount reflecting the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing these services. These amounts are due from patients, third-party
payors (including Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance payers), and others. The patient is considered the Company s customer,
and a signed patient treatment consent typically constitutes a written contract between the Company and the patient. Patient care services
are considered discrete and are initiated and concluded at the patient s discretion, which occurs each individual appointment.
Generally, the Company satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time, specifically when it has the right to invoice the customer
for the work completed, which usually occurs on an interaction basis for the work performed during any given billable interaction. The
Company has determined that the underlying nature of the services provided remains consistent across different payor types. Consequently,
the Company utilizes a portfolio approach to assess price concessions in its contracts with patients. The Company recognizes revenue
for patient care services net of price concessions, which include contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts offered
to uninsured patients in accordance with the Company s policy, and/or implicit price concessions extended to patients. Implicit
price concessions, representing differences between the amount the Company expects to receive from patients and standard billing rates,
are accounted for as contractual adjustments or discounts, deducted from gross revenue to calculate net revenues. The Company bases its
estimates of contractual adjustments and discounts on contractual agreements, its discount policies, and historical experience. 

Revenue
from retail sales is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer. This occurs when the customer can direct the
use of, and obtain substantially all benefits from, the Company s products, generally at the time of shipment or customer pickup.
Revenue is recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration such as product returns, rebates, discounts,
and other adjustments. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded
from revenues. 

19 

Revenue
from service affiliate agreements is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, or when
services are rendered to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified,
payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and the collectability of consideration is probable. The company
recognizes revenue after the service price has been allocated and when it satisfies the performance obligation. Usually, there is only
a single performance obligation in the sale and service, and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance
obligation. This typically occurs at a point in time when products and or services are rendered, delivered, or shipped. The transaction price for contracts is set per the contract language. The transaction
price for services is set by the company for the various service options, less current discounts or coupons offered, where those discounts
are set and approved by management from time to time. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets such property and equipment and right-of-use ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might
not be recoverable. These events and circumstances may include significant decreases in the market price of an asset or asset group,
significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used by the Company or in its physical condition,
a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate, a history or forecast of future operating or cash flow losses, significant
disposal activity, a significant decline in the Company s share price, a significant decline in revenue or adverse changes in the
economic environment. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by
determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability
test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group
using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be
measured as the difference between the asset group s carrying amount and its estimated fair value. 

Stock-Based
Compensation. We recognize the fair value compensation cost relating to stock-based payment transactions in accordance with ASC
Topic 718, Share-Based Payments. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at
the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee s requisite
service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of our stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option
valuation model. Restricted stock awards are valued based on the closing stock price on the date of grant (intrinsic value method).
The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur. 

Embedded
Derivative Liabilities. The Company evaluates the embedded features in accordance with ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity , and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. Certain conversion
options and redemption features are required to be bifurcated from their host instrument and accounted for as free-standing
derivative financial instruments should certain criteria be met. The Company applies significant judgment to identify and evaluate
complex terms and conditions of all of its financial instruments, including notes payable, to determine whether such instruments are
derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives must be separately measured from the host
contract if all the requirements for bifurcation are met. The assessment of the conditions surrounding the bifurcation of embedded
derivatives depends on the nature of the host contract and the features of the derivatives. Bifurcated embedded derivatives are
recognized at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations each period.
