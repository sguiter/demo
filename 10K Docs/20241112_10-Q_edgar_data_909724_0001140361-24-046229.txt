Item 2.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The Business and Strategy 

Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. is one of the world s largest specialty retailers of leather and leathercraft-related items. Founded in 1919 in Fort Worth, Texas, and organized in 2005 as a Delaware corporation, the
 Company introduced leathercrafting to millions of American and later Canadian and other international customers and has built a track record as the trusted source of quality leather, tools, hardware, supplies, kits and teaching materials for
 leatherworkers everywhere. Today, our mission remains to build on our legacy of inspiring the timeless art and trade of leatherworking.

What differentiates Tandy from the competition is our high brand awareness and strong brand equity and loyalty, our network of retail stores that provides convenience, a high-touch customer service experience, and
 a hub for the local leathercrafting community, and our 100-year heritage. We believe that this combination of qualities is unique to Tandy and gives the brand competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate.

We sell our products primarily through company-owned stores and through orders generated from our global websites, and through direct account representatives in our commercial division. We also manufacture leather
 lace, cut leather pieces and most of the do-it-yourself kits that are sold in our stores and on our websites. We also offer production services to our business customers such as cutting clicking ), splitting, and some assembly. We maintain our
 principal offices at 1900 Southeast Loop 820, Fort Worth, Texas 76140.

Currently, the Company operates a total of 100 retail stores. There are 90 stores in the United States U.S, ), nine stores in Canada and one store in Spain.

Tandy Leather has been introducing people to leatherworking for over 100 years. Our stores have been and continue to be our competitive advantage:
 where our consumers learn the craft in classes, open table , and from the expertise of our store staff, where they can touch, feel and test the product, and where they can connect and commune with others passionate about leather. Our
 websites provide inspiration, detailed product descriptions and specifications, educational information and videos, and a convenient place to also purchase products 
 especially for those who are far from our retail stores, including a growing international customer base. For many of our retail and web customers, leatherworking evolves from a passion to a trade. Our Commercial Division is tailored to the
 needs of those customers who build businesses around leather. With dedicated direct account representatives, a direct-from-our-warehouse shipping model, bulk and volume-based competitive pricing, customized product development, and production
 and pre-production services, we are building long-term, strategic relationships with our largest customers.

In 2019, with the arrival of a new management team, we began the process of assessing and reinvigorating the business. We focused in three broad strategic initiative areas: 1) improving our brand proposition, 2)
 rebuilding our foundation: the talent, processes, tools and systems needed to modernize and efficiently operate the business, and 3) creating a vision and road map for long-term growth. We had significant achievements in all of these areas
 including significantly improving the product quality, breadth of assortment and value, dramatically improving the website and web operations, rebuilding the team, people policies and culture, and replacing all of the key systems, among many
 other accomplishments.

We made this steady progress to transform and reinvigorate our business even in the face of two very significant obstacles: a financial restatement and COVID-19. With those obstacles behind us, we have been
 focused on improving our financial sustainability and profitability. In the short-term, we are managing operating expenses and gross margin to deliver free operating cash and operating income even in the face of possible continued economic
 headwinds. We will also continue to selectively invest in profitable sales growth where it makes sense, but rebuilding a durable, profitable business model is the highest priority.

Net Sales

Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.2 million, or 1.1 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. We believe the
 decrease in sales was due in part to temporary store closures related to store relocation and weather including Hurricanes Beryl, Debby, Francine and Helene, and ongoing
 weak consumer demand compared to a year ago resulting from uncertainty related to global political, economic and other uncontrollable factors.

Our store footprint consisted of 100 and 103 stores at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the 12-month period ending September 30,
 2024, we closed 5 stores and opened 2 new stores for a net decrease of 3 stores. Of the 100 current stores, 2 are temporarily closed during relocation and will reopen before the end of the year.

We evaluate a number of factors when determining whether to close existing stores, including the 4-wall cash flow trend and longer-term projection for the store, the long-term sales trend, ongoing cost of store
 operations, date of lease expiration, quality of the store and location, and the size and potential of the trade area including proximity to other existing stores, among other variables. We use similar factors to determine whether to open new
 stores.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the quarter decreased by 0.9 million, or 8.4 , compared to the same period in 2023, and our gross margin percentage for the quarter ended September
 30, 2024, decreased year-over-year by 460 basis points due primarily to timing of capitalization of our inventoriable costs, and greater promotional activity this year compared to same period last year, to help overcome decreased consumer
 discretionary spend.

Operating expenses for the quarter increased by 0.2 million or 2.3 compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily as a result of an increase in
 employment costs of 0.6 million due to higher wages, in particular for retail and other hourly employees, partially offset by a decrease in bonus accrual of 0.3 million and a decrease of 0.1 million in miscellaneous operating expenses
 including travel, repairs, and insurance.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 27.7 and 24.0 respectively. Our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to U.S.
 state income tax expense, and expenses that are nondeductible for tax purposes, and the estimates in our valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets.

Net Sales

Consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1.5 million, or 2.7 , compared to the corresponding prior year period. We believe the decrease in sales was due in part to temporary
 store closure and ongoing weak consumer demand compared to a year ago, continued weaker consumer demand resulting from ongoing uncertainty related to global political, economic and other uncontrollable factors, exacerbated by temporary store
 closures and moves.

Our store footprint consisted of 100 and 103 stores at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the 12-month period ending September 30,

Gross profit decreased by 2.7 million, or 8.1 , compared to the same period in 2023, and our gross margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased year over year by 340 basis points due
 to a one-time accounting adjustment in cost of sales as reported in our 2023 second quarter 10-Q, and timing of capitalization of inventoriable costs in Q3 2024 and greater promotional activity to help overcome decreased consumer discretionary
 spend .

Operating expenses decreased by 0.5 million or 1.7 compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily as a result of a decrease in bonus accrual of 1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in medical
 insurance of 0.2 million, an increase in employment costs of 0.2 million, and an increase in utilities of 0.1 million.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.5 compared to 28.8 for the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to U.S.
 state income tax expense, expenses that are nondeductible for tax purposes, and the change in our valuation allowance associated with our deferred tax assets.

Capital Resources, Liquidity and Financial Condition 

We require cash principally for day-to-day operations, to purchase inventory and to finance capital investments. We expect to fund our operating and liquidity needs primarily from a combination of current cash
 balances and cash generated from operating activities. Any excess cash will be invested as determined by our Board of Directors in accordance with its approved investment policy. Our cash balances as of September 30, 2024 totaled 10.1
 million.
