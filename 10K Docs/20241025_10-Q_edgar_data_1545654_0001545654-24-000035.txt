The Company will operate the VIE pursuant to a management agreement until the reverse exchange transaction is completed or the Company elects to collapse the reverse exchange structure. As the primary beneficiary with the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and all the risks and rewards of ownership, the Company has consolidated the VIE. The assets of the VIE primarily consist of leased property (net real estate and intangibles).

 Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company records its interest rate swaps at fair value. The fair values of the Company's interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy and are based on the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date and are determined using interest rate pricing models and interest rate related observable inputs (refer to Note 7 Derivative Instruments for fair value information regarding the Company's derivative instruments). 
 Non-Recurring Fair Value 
 Certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. The Company s process for identifying and recording impairment is discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Impairment of Assets Held for Sale, net: As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, CRE improved property met the criteria for classification as held for sale and accordingly, was measured at its fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded additional fair value adjustment related to assets and liabilities held for sale. The Company classifies these fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they are determined using significant unobservable inputs such as management assumptions about expected sales proceeds from third parties.

 Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value 
 Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, net and notes payable and other debt. The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, net and short-term borrowings approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of the instruments, and are classified as Level 1 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. 
 The fair value of the Company's notes receivable approximated the carrying amount of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of these notes is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis in which the Company uses unobservable inputs such as market interest rates determined by the loan-to-value and market capitalization rates related to the underlying collateral at which management believes similar loans would be made, and is classified as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. 
 million and the corresponding fair value was million. At December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company's notes payable and other debt was million and the corresponding fair value was million. The fair value of debt is calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the debt at rates based on instruments with similar risk, terms and maturities as compared to the Company's existing debt arrangements, and is classified as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy.

interest rate swap agreements, all of which were designated as cash flow hedges. The key terms are as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 
 Effective Maturity Fixed Interest Notional Amount at Asset (Liability) Fair Value at Date Date Rate September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Interest Rate Swap Agreements 4/7/2016 8/1/2029 5/1/2024 12/9/2031 ) ) Forward-Starting Interest Rate Swap Agreement 12/9/2024 12/9/2031 ) ) 
 The asset related to the interest rate swap and liabilities related to the interest rate swap and forward interest rate swap as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are presented within Prepaid expenses and other assets and Accrued and other liabilities , respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense as interest is incurred on the related variable-rate debt. Changes in fair value of undesignated cash flow hedges, including de-designated hedges, are recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net . 
 In 2022, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million and million in order to hedge interest rate fluctuations related to million of future financing aligned with the effective and maturity dates listed. The Company designated the hedging relationships of these forward interest swap agreements as cash flow hedges at their inception. In December 2023, the Company de-designated the forward interest swap agreements as it was determined that underlying cash flows related to the designated hedging relationships were no longer probable of occurring. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in Interest and other income (expense), net a million loss related to the fair value adjustment of the de-designated hedging relationships. Subsequent changes in fair value of the forward interest rate swaps were recorded in earnings until, on February 29, 2024, the Company re-designated the hedging relationships of both forward interest rate swaps in anticipation of future financing. The Company recorded a gain on forward interest rate swap valuation adjustment of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that occurred prior to the date of re-designation. Cash settlements related to the million notional amount interest rate swap began on May 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was forward-starting interest rate swap remaining.

 million as of September 30, 2024, and represent commercial bonds issued by third party sureties (permit, subdivision, license and notary bonds). If drawn upon, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the surety that issued the bond for the amount of the bond, reduced for the work completed to date. 
 Legal proceedings and other contingencies 
 Prior to the sale of approximately acres of agricultural land on Maui to Mahi Pono Holdings, LLC ("Mahi Pono") in December 2018, the Company, through East Maui Irrigation Company, LLC ("EMI"), also owned approximately acres of watershed lands in East Maui and held water licenses to approximately acres owned by the State of Hawai i in East Maui. The sale to Mahi Pono included the sale of a interest in EMI (which closed February 1, 2019), and provided for the Company and Mahi Pono, through EMI, to jointly continue the existing process to secure a long-term lease from the State for delivery of irrigation water to Mahi Pono for use in Central Maui. 
 The last of these water license agreements expired in 1986, and all agreements were then extended as revocable permits that were renewed annually. In 2001, a request was made to the State Board of Land and Natural Resources (the "BLNR") to replace these revocable permits with a long-term water lease. Pending the completion by the BLNR of a contested case hearing it ordered to be held on the request for the long-term lease, the BLNR has kept the existing permits on a holdover basis. parties (Healoha Carmichael; Lezley Jacintho; and Na Moku Aupuni O Ko olau Hui) filed a lawsuit on April 10, 2015, (the "Initial Lawsuit") alleging that the BLNR has been renewing the revocable permits annually rather than keeping them in holdover status. The lawsuit challenged the BLNR s decision to continue the revocable permits for calendar year 2015 and asked the court to void the revocable permits and to declare that the renewals were illegally issued without preparation of an environmental assessment ("EA"). In December 2015, the BLNR decided to reaffirm its prior decisions to keep the permits in holdover status. This decision by the BLNR was challenged by the parties. In January 2016, the court ruled in the Initial Lawsuit that the renewals were not subject to the EA requirement, but that the BLNR lacked legal authority to keep the revocable permits in holdover status beyond (the "Initial Ruling"). The Initial Ruling was appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals ("ICA") of the State of Hawai i. 
 In May 2016, while the appeal of the Initial Ruling was pending, the Hawai i State Legislature passed House Bill 2501, which specified that the BLNR has the legal authority to issue holdover revocable permits for the disposition of water rights for a period not to exceed . The governor signed this bill into law as Act 126 in June 2016. Pursuant to Act 126, the annual authorization of the existing holdover permits was sought and granted by the BLNR in December 2016, November 2017 and November 2018 for calendar years 2017, 2018, and 2019. No extension of Act 126 was approved by the Hawai i State Legislature in 2019. 
 In June 2019, the ICA vacated the Initial Ruling, effectively reversing the determination that the BLNR lacked authority to keep the revocable permits in holdover status beyond (the "ICA Ruling"). The ICA remanded the case back to the trial court to determine whether the holdover status of the permits was both (a) "temporary" and (b) in the best interest of the State, as required by statute. The plaintiffs filed a motion with the ICA for reconsideration of its decision, which was denied on July 5, 2019. On September 30, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a request with the Supreme Court of Hawai i to review and reverse the ICA Ruling. On November 25, 2019, the Supreme Court of Hawai i granted the plaintiffs' request to review the ICA Ruling and, on May 5, 2020, oral argument was held. 
 On October 11, 2019, the BLNR took up the renewal of all the existing water revocable permits in the state, acting under the ICA Ruling, and approved the continuation of the East Maui water revocable permits for another period through December 31, 2020. On November 13, 2020, the BLNR approved another renewal of such permits through December 31, 2021. 
 On March 2, 2022, the Supreme Court of Hawai i vacated the ICA s ruling relating to the BLNR's decision to continue the revocable permits for the calendar year 2015, holding that Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343 (the Hawaii Environmental Policy Act) did apply to the permits. The court remanded the matter back to the Circuit Court to determine if any exceptions would apply and, if not, how HRS Chapter 343 should be applied in light of the steps taken by A B/EMI toward the long-term water lease. The Supreme Court of Hawai i also determined that the BLNR had the statutory authority to continue the permits for more than , but required the BLNR to make findings of fact and conclusions of law determining that the action would serve the best interests of the State. On remand, the Carmichael Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment asking the Circuit Court to conclude that the BLNR and A B/EMI violated HRS Chapter 343 when the BLNR continued the revocable permits for calendar year 2015. On December 21, 2023, the Circuit Court entered its order granting in part and denying in part the motion for partial summary judgment, determining that the BLNR and A B/EMI had violated HRS Chapter

million gallons a day until a permit or lease is properly issued by the BLNR, and for the imposition of certain conditions on the revocable permits by the BLNR. The count seeking to invalidate the revocable permits based on the failure to perform an EA was dismissed by the court, based on the ICA Ruling in the Initial Lawsuit. The Sierra Club s lawsuit was amended to include a challenge to the BLNR s renewal of the revocable permits for calendar year 2020. After a full trial on the merits held beginning in August of 2020, the court ruled, on April 6, 2021, against the Sierra Club on its lawsuit challenging the 2019 and 2020 revocable permits. On February 17, 2022, the Sierra Club filed its notice of appeal challenging the decision on the August 2020 trial. The court separately considered a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club appealing the BLNR s decision to deny it a contested case hearing on the 2021 revocable permits, which were granted by the BLNR on or about November 13, 2020. In that case, on May 28, 2021, the court issued an interim decision that the Sierra Club s due process rights were violated, ordered the BLNR to hold a contested case hearing on the 2021 permits, and that the permits would be vacated. On July 30, 2021, the court modified its ruling to say that the permits would not be invalidated, but left in place pending the outcome of the contested case hearing. The contested case hearing was held by the BLNR in December 2021 to address the continuation of the revocable permits for both calendar years 2021 and 2022 and the BLNR issued a decision on June 30, 2022. On December 27, 2021, while the BLNR s decision in the contested case hearing was pending, the court further modified its ruling to allow the permits to remain in place until the earlier of May 1, 2022, the date on which the BLNR renders a substantive decision on the continuation of the permits for calendar year 2022, or further order of the court. On April 26, 2022, the court orally granted an extension of the May 1, 2022 deadline to the earlier of June 15, 2022, or the date on which the BLNR renders a substantive decision on the continuation of the permits for calendar year 2022, or as may be further ordered by the court. On June 1, 2022, the court granted an extension of the June 15, 2022 deadline to the earlier of July 15, 2022 or the date on which the BLNR renders a substantive decision on the continuation of the permits for calendar year 2022 or as may be further ordered by the court. On June 30, 2022, the BLNR issued its final decision on the contested case hearing on the permits for calendar years 2021 and 2022, approving the continuation of the permits through the end of calendar year 2022. The Company and the BLNR appealed the court s determination that the Sierra Club was entitled to a contested case hearing on the 2021 revocable permits. At the request of the Sierra Club, the Intermediate Court of Appeals held oral argument on the matter on December 13, 2023. On April 12, 2024, the ICA issued its opinion holding that the Sierra Club was not entitled to a contested case hearing, the circuit court erred by modifying the permits, and the Sierra Club was not entitled to attorneys fees and costs. The Sierra Club filed an application with the Supreme Court of Hawai i for a writ of certiorari challenging the ICA s opinion. On July 11, 2024, the Supreme Court of Hawai i entered its order accepting Sierra Club's application for a writ of certiorari. In July 2022, the Sierra Club filed a separate appeal challenging the BLNR s June 30, 2022 decision on the contested case hearing on the permits for calendar years 2021 and 2022. On March 31, 2023, the court entered its decision on appeal, dismissing the appeal as moot. On January 29, 2024, the court entered final judgment in this case. On February 8, 2024, the Sierra Club filed a notice of appeal with the Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
 On November 10, 2022, the BLNR voted to continue the revocable permits for calendar year 2023 and, at that same meeting, denied the Sierra Club s oral request for a contested case hearing. The Sierra Club subsequently submitted a written request to the BLNR for a contested case hearing on the continuation of the revocable permits, which the BLNR denied on December 9,

million gallons per day. A B/EMI filed motions to increase the modified cap and for leave to take an immediate appeal. On August 11, 2023, the court entered its order denying A B/EMI s motion for leave to take an immediate appeal. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its ruling denying without prejudice A B/EMI s motion to increase the modified cap. On August 17, 2023, Sierra Club filed its First Motion to Modify Permits, asking the court to impose conditions on the revocable permits requiring A B/EMI to determine the water needs of the County of Maui Fire Department and to line reservoir, which the court granted in part, ordering the parties to meet with the County of Maui Fire Department to discuss the Department s water needs. In January 2024, the court entered final judgment in this case. In February 2024, A B/EMI and BLNR filed separate notices of appeal with the Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
 On December 8, 2023, the BLNR issued a new revocable permit to the Company for calendar year 2024. On that same date, after the BLNR voted to grant the new revocable permit to the Company, Sierra Club made an oral request for a contested case hearing and, on December 18, 2023, filed a written request for the same. The BLNR has not decided on Sierra Club s requests for a contested case hearing. 
 In connection with A B s obligation to continue the existing process to secure a long-term water lease from the State, A B and EMI will defend against the remaining claims made by the Sierra Club. 
 In addition to the litigation described above, the Company is a party to, or may be contingently liable in connection with, other legal actions arising in the normal conduct of its businesses. While the outcomes of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel, the reasonably possible losses would not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a whole. 
 Further note that certain of the Company's properties and assets may become the subject of other types of claims and assessments at various times (e.g., environmental matters based on normal operations of such assets). Depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding such potential claims and assessments, the Company records an accrual if it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated/valued as of the date of the financial statements.

Related to the periods during which such relationships existed, revenues earned from transactions with such affiliates were million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses recognized from transactions with such affiliates were million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Introduction and Objective 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") provides additional material information about the Company's business, recent developments and financial condition; its results of operations at a consolidated and segment level; its liquidity and capital resources including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources; and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect its financial statements. MD A is organized as follows: 
 Business Overview: This section provides a general description of the Company's business, as well as recent developments that management believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or in understanding anticipated future trends. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations: This section provides an analysis of the Company's consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year. 
 Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment: This section provides an analysis of the Company's results of operations by business segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This section provides a discussion of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures included in this report and presents quantitative reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources: This section provides a discussion of any material changes in the Company's liquidity, financial condition and cash flows, including a discussion of any material changes in the Company's ability to fund its future commitments and ongoing operating activities in the short-term (i.e., over the next twelve months from the most recent fiscal period end) and in the long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months) through internal and external sources of capital, as compared to the end of preceding fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. It includes an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. 
 25 

Other Matters: This section identifies and summarizes other matters to be discussed in Item 2 of this report including any changes in the significant judgments or critical accounting estimates on the part of management in preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements that may materially impact the Company's reported results of operations and financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the potential impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements and other miscellaneous matters as needed. 
 Amounts in the MD A are rounded to the nearest thousand. Accordingly, a recalculation of totals and percentages, if based on the reported data, may be slightly different. 
 
 Business Overview 
 Reportable segments 
 The Company operates two segments: Commercial Real Estate and Land Operations. A description of each of the Company's reporting segments is as follows: 
 Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") - This segment functions as a vertically integrated real estate investment company with core competencies in property management and in-house leasing (i.e., executing new and renegotiating renewal lease arrangements, managing its properties' day-to-day operations and maintaining positive tenant relationships); investments and acquisitions (i.e., identifying opportunities and acquiring properties); and construction and development (i.e., designing and ground-up development of new properties or repositioning and redevelopment of existing properties). The Company's preferred asset classes include improved properties in retail and industrial spaces, and also urban ground leases. Its focus within improved retail properties, in particular, is on grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers that meet the daily needs of Hawai i communities. Through its core competencies and with its experience and relationships in Hawai i, the Company seeks to create special places that enhance the lives of Hawai i residents and to provide venues and opportunities that enable its tenants to thrive. Income from this segment is principally generated by owning, operating, and leasing real estate assets. 
 Land Operations - This segment includes the Company's legacy landholdings, assets, and liabilities that are subject to the Company's simplification and monetization effort. Financial results from this segment are principally derived from real estate development and land sales, and joint venture activity. 
 Simplification strategy 
 As a REIT focused on Hawai i commercial real estate, the Company has pursued the monetization and disposition of legacy, non-core assets and landholdings in order to simplify its business and allocate its capital resources to commercial real estate. In November 2023, the Company completed the sale of its interests in Grace Pacific, a materials and construction company, and Company-owned quarry land on Maui (collectively, the "Grace Disposal Group"), marking the last major step in the Company's simplification efforts that began in 2016. The financial results associated with the Grace Disposal Group are classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Related to the Land Operations segment, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the sale of approximately 420 acres of land holdings on Maui and Kauai for 20.1 million.

 The causes of material changes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, are described below or in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment sections below. 
 27 

Operating revenue during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 18.0 , or 9.4 million, to 61.9 million, due primarily to higher revenues from the Land Operations segment's unimproved and other land sales of approximately 81 acres of land holdings on Maui, as well as the sale of one development parcel at Maui Business Park in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Cost of operations during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 18.9 , or 5.1 million, to 32.4 million, due primarily to the Land Operations segment's higher cost of sales associated with unimproved and other land sales and the Maui Business Park development lot sale. 
 Impairment of assets of 0.6 million during the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, related to abandonment of potential CRE development projects. 
 Income (loss) related to joint ventures during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 125.5 , or 1.2 million, to 2.1 million, due primarily to higher earnings from the Company's unconsolidated investment in a materials company. 
 Interest and other income (expense), net during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased 0.7 million, to 0.9 million due primarily to the collection of interest income related to a note receivable, which was previously reserved, in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Loss from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, of 0.3 million relates to the resolution of cessation related liabilities associated with the Company's former sugar operations. Income from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) during the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, of 3.9 million primarily relates to operations of the Grace Disposal Group, which was sold in November 2023.

The causes of material changes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, are described below or in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Profit by Segment sections below. 
 Operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 11.7 , or 18.2 million, to 174.2 million, primarily due to higher revenues from the Land Operations segment's unimproved and other land sales of approximately 420 acres of land holdings on Maui and Kauai, as well as the sale of four development lots at Maui Business Park in the current period compared to none in the prior year period. 
 29 

Cost of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 11.4 or 9.5 million, to 92.3 million, primarily due to the Land Operations segment's higher cost of sales associated with unimproved and other land sales and the Maui Business Park development lot sales. 
 Selling, general and administrative for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 16.3 , or 4.3 million, to 21.9 million, due to lower personnel-related expenses primarily related to the Chief Executive Officer transition in the prior year. 
 Impairment of assets of 0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to abandonment of potential CRE development projects. 
 Gain from disposals, net of 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is related to the favorable resolution of contingent liabilities related to the sale of a legacy business in a prior year. Gain from disposals, net of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the sale of the Company's ownership interest in a legacy trucking and storage business on Maui. 
 Income (loss) related to joint ventures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 104.2 , or 2.0 million, to 3.8 million, due primarily to higher earnings from the Company's unconsolidated investment in a materials company. 
 Interest and other income (expense), net of 2.7 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due primarily to a gain on the fair value adjustment for two forward interest rate swaps and the collection of interest income related to a note receivable, which was previously reserved, that was collected in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a one-time financing charge. 
 Loss from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 3.2 million relates to the resolution of cessation related liabilities associated with the Company's former sugar operations. Income from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of 3.9 million primarily relates to operations of the Grace Disposal Group, which was sold in November 2023.

 2 For a discussion of management's use of non-GAAP financial measures and the required reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, refer to page 36 . 
 
 Commercial Real Estate operating revenue increased 2.4 or 1.1 million, to 49.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. Operating profit increased 10.6 , or 2.2 million, to 22.8 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating revenue from the prior year period was primarily driven by higher rental and recovery revenue. The increase in operating profit from the prior year period was due primarily driven by the aforementioned higher revenues, compounded by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in the current year, as well as lower impairment of real estate assets of 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to the abandonment of potential CRE development projects, that did not recur in the current year.

Commercial Real Estate portfolio additions, transfers, and dispositions 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's acquisitions of commercial real estate properties were as follows (dollars in millions): 
 Acquisitions Property Location Date (Month/Year) Transaction Price GLA (SF) Waihona Industrial Oahu 09/2024 29.7 81,495 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no transfers or dispositions of commercial real estate properties. 
 Leasing activity 
 During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company signed 23 new leases and 48 renewal leases for its improved properties across its retail, industrial, and office asset classes, covering 182,100 square feet of GLA. The 23 new leases consist of 35,100 square feet with an average annual base rent of 38.03 per-square-foot. Of the 23 new leases, 13 leases with a total GLA of 24,600 square feet were considered comparable (i.e., renewals, for the same units, or new leases executed for units that have been vacated in the previous 12 months for comparable space and comparable lease terms) and, for these 13 leases, resulted in an 21.6 average base rent increase over comparable expiring leases. The 48 renewal leases consist of 147,000 square feet with an average annual base rent of 36.33 per square foot. Of the 48 renewal leases, 40 leases with a total GLA of 132,000 square feet were considered comparable and resulted in an 14.3 average base rent increase over comparable expiring leases. The Company signed one new ground lease renewals during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Occupancy 
 The Company reports three types of occupancy: "Leased Occupancy," "Physical Occupancy," and "Economic Occupancy." 
 The Leased Occupancy percentage calculates the square footage leased (i.e., the space has been committed to by a lessee under a signed lease agreement) as a percentage of total available improved property square footage as of the end of the period reported. 
 The Physical Occupancy percentage calculates the square footage leased and commenced (i.e., measured when the lessee has physical access to the space) as a percentage of total available improved property space at the end of the period reported. 
 The Economic Occupancy percentage calculates the square footage under leases for which the lessee is contractually obligated to make lease-related payments (i.e., subsequent to the rent commencement date) to total available improved property square footage as of the end of the period reported. 
 As of As of Basis Point Change September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Leased Occupancy 94.0 94.6 (60) Physical Occupancy 93.5 93.9 (40) Economic Occupancy 93.0 92.9 10

 Land Operations 
 Trends, events and uncertainties 
 The asset class mix of Land Operations segment real estate sales in any given period can be diverse and may include developable subdivision lots, undeveloped land, or property sold under threat of condemnation. Further, the timing of property or parcel sales can significantly affect operating results in a given period. 
 Operating profit reported in each period for the Land Operations segment does not necessarily follow a percentage of sales trend because the cost basis of property sold can differ significantly between transactions. For example, the sale of undeveloped land and vacant parcels in Hawai i may result in higher margins than the sale of developed property due to the low historical cost basis of the Company's legacy landholdings. 
 As a result, direct year-over-year comparison of the Land Operations segment results may not provide a consistent, measurable indicator of future performance. Further, Land Operations revenue trends, cash flows from the sales of real estate, and the amounts of real estate developments for sale on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet do not necessarily indicate future profitability trends for this segment.

 Land Operations operating profit of 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily composed of the margins resulting from land sales, equity in earnings from joint ventures of 1.9 million primarily related to the Company's unconsolidated investment in a materials company, and the gain on disposal of the Company's ownership interest in a legacy trucking and storage business on Maui of 1.1 million. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company uses non-GAAP measures when evaluating operating performance because management believes that they provide additional insight into the Company's and segments' core operating results, and/or the underlying business trends affecting performance on a consistent and comparable basis from period to period. These measures generally are provided to investors as an additional means of evaluating the performance of ongoing core operations. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations 
 
 Funds from operations FFO is a widely used supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of REITs' operating performance. FFO is computed in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit and is calculated as follows: net income (loss) available to A B common shareholders (calculated in accordance 
 36 

with GAAP), excluding (1) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (2) gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, (3) gains and losses from change in control, (4) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, and (5) income (loss) from discontinued operations related to legacy business operations. 
 Management believes that FFO serves as a supplemental measure to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP for comparing its performance and operations to those of other REITs because it excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of the Company s operating and financial performance, such as depreciation and amortization related to real estate, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time instead of fluctuating with market conditions, and items that can make periodic or peer analysis more difficult, such as gains and losses from the sale of CRE properties, impairment losses related to CRE properties, and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that FFO more accurately provides an investor an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and fund other needs. 
 The Company has been executing a simplification strategy to focus on the growth and expansion of its commercial real estate portfolio in Hawai i by monetizing its legacy assets and operations. The sale of Grace Pacific, LLC and the Company-owned quarry land on Maui in 2023 marked the culmination of the Company s simplification strategy. Although the Company has some remaining legacy assets to be monetized, investors and analysts now view the Company as a pure-play REIT. In order to enhance comparability to other REITs, the Company provides an additional performance metric, Adjusted FFO, to further adjust FFO to exclude the effects of certain items not related to ongoing property operations. Adjusted FFO is a widely recognized measure of the property operations of REITs and may be more useful than FFO in evaluating the operating performance of the Company s properties over the long term, as well as enabling investors and analysts to assess performance in comparison to other real estate companies 
 
 Adjusted FFO is an additional supplemental non-GAAP measure of REITs' operating performance. It is calculated by adjusting FFO to exclude share-based compensation, straight-line lease adjustments and other non-cash adjustments, such as amortization of market lease adjustments, debt premium or discount and deferred financing cost amortization, maintenance capital expenditures, leasing commissions, provision for current expected credit losses and other non-comparable and non-operating items, including certain gains, losses, income, and expenses related to the Company s legacy business operations and assets. 
 FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent alternatives to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as more prominent measures of performance than net income (loss) or cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, nor should they be used as measures of the Company s liquidity, or cash available to fund the Company s needs or pay distributions. FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered only as supplements to net income as a measure of the Company s performance. 
 
 The Company presents both non-GAAP measures and reconciles FFO to the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, Net Income (Loss) available to A B common shareholders, and FFO to Adjusted FFO. The Company's FFO and Adjusted FFO may not be comparable to such metrics reported by other REITs due to possible differences in the interpretation of the current Nareit definition used by such REITs.

Net Operating Income and Same-Store Net Operating Income 
 
 NOI is a non-GAAP measure used internally in evaluating the unlevered performance of the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio. Management believes NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only the contract-based income and cash-based expense items that are incurred at the property level. When compared across periods, NOI can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by non-contract-based revenue (e.g., straight-line lease adjustments required under GAAP); by non-cash expense recognition items (e.g., the impact of depreciation and amortization expense or impairments); or by other income, expenses, gains, or losses that do not directly relate to the Company's ownership and operations of the properties (e.g., indirect selling, general, administrative and other expenses, as well as lease termination income). Management believes the exclusion of these items from operating profit (loss) is useful because the resulting measure captures the contract-based revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) and the direct property-related expenses paid or payable in cash that are incurred in operating the Company's Commercial Real Estate portfolio, as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. NOI should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 NOI represents total Commercial Real Estate contract-based operating revenue that is realizable (i.e., assuming collectability is deemed probable) less the direct property-related operating expenses paid or payable in cash. The calculation of NOI excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization (e.g., depreciation related to capitalized costs for improved properties, other capital expenditures for building/area improvements and tenant space improvements, as well as amortization of leasing commissions); 
 38 

straight-line lease adjustments (including amortization of lease incentives); amortization of favorable/unfavorable lease assets/liabilities; lease termination income; interest and other income (expense), net; selling, general, administrative and other expenses (not directly associated with the property); and impairment of commercial real estate assets. 
 The Company reports NOI and Occupancy on a Same-Store basis, which includes the results of properties that were owned, operated, and stabilized for the entirety of the prior calendar year and current reporting period, year-to-date. The Same-Store pool excludes properties under development, and properties acquired or sold during either of the comparable reporting periods. The Same-Store pool may also exclude properties that are fully or partially taken out of service for the purpose of redevelopment or repositioning. Management judgment is involved in the classification of properties for exclusion from the same-store pool when they are no longer considered stabilized due to redevelopment or other factors. Properties are moved into the Same-Store pool after one full calendar year of stabilized operation. 
 Management believes that reporting on a Same-Store basis provides investors with additional information regarding the operating performance of comparable assets separate from other factors (such as the effect of developments, redevelopments, acquisitions or dispositions). 
 To emphasize, the Company's methods of calculating non-GAAP measures may differ from methods employed by other companies and thus may not be comparable to such other companies. Reconciliations of Commercial Real Estate operating profit to Commercial Real Estate NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are as follows (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 The Company's principal sources of liquidity to meet its business requirements and plans both in the short-term (i.e., the next twelve months from September 30, 2024) and long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months) have generally been cash provided by operating activities; available cash and cash equivalents; and borrowing capacity under its credit facility. The Company's primary liquidity needs for its business requirements and plans have generally been supporting its known contractual obligations and also funding capital expenditures (including recent commercial real estate acquisitions and real estate developments); shareholder distributions; and working capital needs. 
 The Company's ability to retain outstanding borrowings and utilize remaining amounts available under its revolving credit facility will depend on its continued compliance with the applicable financial covenants and other terms of the Company's notes payable and other debt arrangements. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants for all outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024, and intends to operate in compliance with these covenants or seek to obtain waivers or modifications to these financial covenants to enable the Company to maintain compliance in the future. However, due to various uncertainties and factors outside of Management's control, the Company may be unable to continue to maintain compliance with certain of its financial covenants. Failure to maintain compliance with its financial covenants or obtain waivers or agree to modifications with its lenders would have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition. 
 As of September 30, 2024, after the effects of interest rate swaps, the Company had 457.5 million of fixed-rate debt and 15.0 million of variable-rate debt with a total weighted average interest rate of 4.58 . Of the total debt amount of 472.5 million, 181.4 million will become due in the next twelve months. Other than in default, the Company does not have an obligation, nor the option in some cases, to prepay its fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate fluctuations and the resulting changes in fair value would have little impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations unless the Company was required to refinance such debt. 
 Based on its current outlook, the Company believes that funds generated from cash provided by operating activities; available cash and cash equivalent balances; borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility; and proceeds from debt financings will be sufficient to meet the needs of the Company's business requirements and plans both in the short-term (i.e., the next twelve months from September 30, 2024) and long-term (i.e., beyond the next twelve months). 
 On April 15, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Prudential Agreement") with PGIM, Inc. and its affiliates ("Prudential") for an unsecured note purchase and private shelf facility that enables the Company to issue notes in an aggregate amount up to 300.0 million, less the sum of all principal amounts then outstanding on any notes issued by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to Prudential and the amounts of any notes that are committed under the Prudential Agreement for a period of three years from execution of the agreement. In addition, on April 15, 2024, the Company issued a 60.0 million note (the "Series M Note") under its Prudential Agreement. The Series M Note has a coupon rate of 6.09 , paid semiannually, and matures in full on April 15, 2032. 
 On October 17, 2024, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America N.A, as administrative agent, First Hawaiian Bank, KeyBank National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and other lenders party thereto, which amended and restated the existing 500.0 million committed revolving credit facility ("A B Revolver"). The Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement decreased the total revolving commitment to 450.0 million, extended the term of the facility to October 2028 with two six-month extension options, and amended certain covenants. 
 Known contractual obligations 
 A description of material contractual commitments is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K, and relates to the Company's Notes payable and other debt and Accrued post-retirement benefits. In addition, a description of other material cash requirements, including capital expenditures, is provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K, and includes contractual interest payments for Notes payable and other debt as well as amounts to be spent on contractual non-cancellable purchase obligations (that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction that are not recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet). 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in the Company's known contractual obligations from the end of the preceding fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, with the exception of the issuance of a 60.0 million unsecured note and the 
 40 

maturity and repayment of the 57.5 million Laulani Village mortgage. Refer to Note 6 Notes Payable and Other Debt in this report for further discussion. 
 Further, a description of other commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in the Company's other commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements from the end of the preceding fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in this report for further discussion. 
 Sources of liquidity 
 As noted above, one of the Company's principal sources of liquidity has been operating cash flows from continuing operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating cash flows from continuing operations of 75.4 million was primarily driven by cash generated by the Commercial Real Estate segment (the Company's core business) and cash proceeds from unimproved land and development sales in the Land Operations segment. The Company's operating cash flows from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents an increase of 19.6 million from 55.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to higher cash proceeds from unimproved land and development sales as well as collections throughout 2024 on note receivables related to prior years land sales. Total cash flows in future periods may be subject to variation from the Land Operations segment due to the varying activity in completing sales on remaining non-core assets as part of the Company's continued execution on its simplification strategy and development property sales. 
 The Company's other primary sources of liquidity include its cash on-hand of 17.9 million as of September 30, 2024, and the Company's revolving credit and term facilities, which provide liquidity and flexibility on a short-term (i.e., the next twelve months from September 30, 2024), as well as long-term basis. With respect to the 500.0 million A B Revolver available for general A B purposes, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 72.0 million of borrowings outstanding, no letters of credit issued against, and 428.0 million of available capacity. As noted above, on October 17, 2024, the A B Revolver was amended and the total revolving commitment was decreased to 450.0 million and the term of the facility was extended to October 2028 with two six-month extension options. 
 On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into an at-the-market equity distribution agreement, or ATM Agreement, pursuant to which it may sell common stock up to an aggregate sales price of 200.0 million. Sales of common stock, if any, made pursuant to the ATM Agreement may be sold in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market offerings, as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock, capital needs, and the Company's determination of the appropriate sources of funding to meet such needs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not sold any shares under the at-the-market offering program, nor has any obligation to sell shares under the at-the-market offering program. 
 Other uses (or sources) of liquidity 
 The Company may use (or, in some periods, generate) cash through various investing activities or financing activities. Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations was 40.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by capital expenditures of 41.7 million, including 29.8 million in capital expenditures for commercial real estate property acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by capital expenditures of 23.1 million, including 9.5 million in capital expenditures for commercial real estate property acquisitions, partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of the Company's legacy trucking and storage business in the Land Operations segment. 
 As it relates to the CRE segment, the Company differentiates capital expenditures as follows (based on management's perspective on discretionary versus non-discretionary areas of spending for its CRE business): 
 Ongoing Maintenance Capital Expenditures: Costs necessary to maintain building value, the current income stream, and position in the market. 
 Discretionary Capital Expenditures: Property acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and tenant improvements to generate income and cash flow growth. 
 41 

Capitalized Indirect Costs: Certain costs related to the development and redevelopment of real estate properties, including: pre-construction costs; real estate taxes; insurance; construction costs; attributable interest expense; and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved. 
 
 Capital expenditures for the respective periods for all segments were as follows (dollars in thousands, unaudited): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Capital expenditures for real estate Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures Building/area improvements 1,335 2,797 3,851 4,459 Tenant space improvements 1,168 666 3,894 1,975 Total ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for real estate 2,503 3,463 7,745 6,434 Discretionary capital expenditures Property acquisitions 29,826 29,826 9,464 Development and redevelopment 1

 1 Excludes capital expenditures for real estate developments to be held and sold as real estate development inventory, which are classified in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as operating activities and are excluded from the tables above. 
 Cash used in financing activities for continuing operations was 43.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 32.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's net cash outlays related to financing activities were primarily due to repayments of secured and unsecured notes payable and other debt of 86.6 million and cash dividend payments totaling 48.8 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of 60.0 million from the Series M Note and net borrowings of 35.0 million on the Company's revolving credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's net cash outlays related to financing activities were due primarily to cash dividend payments totaling 64.2 million and repayments of secured and unsecured notes payable and other debt of 33.7 million, partially offset by net borrowings of 69.0 million on the Company's revolving credit facility. 
 The Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 100.0 million of its common stock between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2025. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. 
 Other capital resource matters 
 The Company frequently utilizes 1031 and 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), to obtain tax-deferral treatment when qualifying real estate assets are sold or become subject to involuntary conversion and the resulting proceeds are reinvested in replacement properties within the required time period. Proceeds from potential tax-deferred sales under 1031 of the Code are held in escrow (and presented as part of Restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets) pending future reinvestment or are returned to the Company for general use if eligibility for tax-deferral treatment based on the required time period lapses. The proceeds from involuntary conversions under 1033 of the Code are held by the Company until the funds are redeployed. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not complete any transactions that would give rise to cash proceeds from sales or involuntary conversion activity that qualified under 1031 or 1033 of the Code and, over the same period, completed one acquisition utilizing a reverse like-kind exchange structure pursuant to 1031 of the Code. As of September 30, 2024, no funds from tax-deferred sales or involuntary conversions were available for use and had not yet been reinvested under 1031 or 1033 of the Code.

Trends, events and uncertainties 
 General economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results. Unfavorable local, regional, national, or global economic developments or uncertainties, including market volatility, supply chain and labor constraints, inflationary pressures, travel restrictions, war, natural disasters or effects of climate change, or a prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our business. The impact of an elevated federal funds rate for a prolonged period, has resulted in a tightening of credit and contributed to volatility in the banking, technology, and housing industries. The ultimate extent of the impact that these trends and events will have on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources will largely depend on future developments, including the resulting impact on economic growth/recession, the impact on travel and tourism behavior and the impact on consumer confidence and discretionary and non-discretionary spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted. 
 
 Other Matters 
 Critical accounting estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, upon which Management's Discussion and Analysis is based, requires that management exercise judgment when making estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty and actual results will, inevitably, differ from those critical accounting estimates. These differences could be material. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company's financial statements were described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. Changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates are included herein. 
 Purchase Price Allocation of Acquired Real Estate 
 In accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations , acquisitions of real estate properties generally do not meet the definition of a business and are treated as asset acquisitions. Upon the acquisition of a property, management assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above-market and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities on a relative fair value basis. All expenses related to an acquisition are capitalized and allocated among the identified assets. Generally, the most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land, and requires the use of market-based estimates and assumptions. 
 
 In estimating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management uses various valuation methods, such as estimated cash flow projections using appropriate discount and capitalization rates, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, estimates of replacement costs net of depreciation, and other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market and economic conditions. Management determines capitalization rates based on recent transactions and other market data and adjusts, if necessary, based on a property's specific characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of a property's site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are available on the market for sale. 
 
 Acquired above-market and below-market leases are recorded at their fair values (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Acquired in-place lease values are recorded based on an evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods are included in the estimate, as appropriate. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are included, as appropriate. Management also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including, but not limited to, the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals.
