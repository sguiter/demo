 The overall quality of the Bank s loan portfolio is primarily assessed using the Bank s risk-grading scale. This review process is assisted by frequent internal reporting of loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans. Credit quality indicators are adjusted based on management s judgment during the quarterly review process. 
 Consumer credit cards are monitored based on a borrower payment history. Credit card loans are classified as performing and are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due when, or in the opinion of management, the collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. As of September 30, 2024, there w ere cred it cards that were evaluated based on economic conditions specific to the loans or borrowers, and were downgraded to substandard and non-performing. 
 Loans subject to risk ratings are graded on a scale of one to ten. 
 Ratings 1 thru 6 Pass - Ratings 1 thru 6 have asset risks ranging from excellent-low to adequate. The specific rating assigned considers customer history of earnings, cash flows, liquidity, leverage, capitalization, consistency of debt service coverage, the nature and extent of customer relationship and other relevant specific business factors such as the stability of the industry or market area, changes to management, litigation or unexpected events that could have an impact on risks. 
 Rating 7 Special Mention - These credits have potential weaknesses due to economic conditions, less than adequate earnings performance or other factors which require the lending officer to direct more than normal attention to the credit. Financing alternatives may be limited and/or command higher risk interest rates. Special mention loan relationships are reviewed at least quarterly. 
 Rating 8 Substandard - Substandard assets are assets that are inadequately protected by the sound worth or paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. Substandard loans are the first adversely classified loans on the Bank's watchlist. These assets have a

 Forward Contracts 
 To avoid interest rate risk, we hedge the open locked/closed position with TBA forward trades. On a regular basis, we allocate disbursed loans to mandatory commitments with government-sponsored enterprises and private investors delivering the loans within 120 days of origination to maximize interest earnings. For a small percentage of our business, we enter into best efforts forward sales commitments with investors at the time we make an IRLC to a borrower. Once a loan has been closed and funded, the best efforts commitments convert to mandatory forward sales commitments. The mandatory commitments are derivatives, and we measure and report them at fair value. Fair value is based on the gain or loss that would occur if we were to pair-off the transaction with the investor at the measurement date. This is a Level 2 input. We have elected to measure and report best efforts commitments at fair value, when outstanding, using a valuation methodology similar to that used for mandatory commitments. 
 Market assumptions utilized in the fair value measurement of the reporting entity s residential mortgage derivatives, inclusive of IRLCs, Closed Loan Inventory, TBA derivative trades, and Mandatory Forwards may be subject to investor overlays that may result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Generally such overlays are announced with advanced notice in order to include the risk adjuster, however there are times when announcements are mandated resulting in a lower fair value measurement. Additionally market assumptions such as spec pool payups may result in a significantly higher fair value measurement at time of loan allocation to specific trades.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 
 The most significant accounting policies that the Company follows are presented in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement included in the 2023 Annual Report. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the financial statements and in this MD A, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that the accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans, goodwill and bargain purchase gain, loans acquired in a business combination and income taxes are critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they relate to accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) , as amended, on January 1, 2023 and in accordance with ASC 326, has recorded an ACL on loans carried at amortized cost. The ACL represents management s best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within the Company's loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The ACL is established through a provision for credit losses and is increased by recoveries of loans previously charged off. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management's assessments confirm that the Company will not collect the full amortized cost basis of a loan. The calculation of expected credit losses is determined using cash flow methodology, and includes considerations of historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that may affect collection of the recorded balances. The Company assesses an ACL to groups of loans which share similar risk characteristics or on an individual basis, as deemed appropriate. Changes in the ACL on loans and the related provision for credit losses, can materially affect financial results. Although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets, the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for loans in the portfolio. 
 The determination of the appropriate level of ACL on loans inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant judgments concerning credit risks and trends using quantitative and qualitative information as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, all of which may undergo frequent and significant changes. Changes in conditions including unforeseen events, changes in asset-specific risk characteristics, and other economic factors both within and outside the Company's control, may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the ACL on loans. While management makes every effort to utilize the best information available in making its assessment of the ACL estimate, the estimation process is inherently challenging as potential changes in any one factor or input may occur at different rates and/or impact pools of loans in different ways. Further, changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. 
 Goodwill and Bargain Purchase Gain 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Determining fair value is subjective, requiring the use of estimates, assumptions, and management judgment. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, usually during the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate. Impairment testing requires a qualitative assessment and/or an independent valuation of the fair value of each of the Company s reporting units compared to the carrying amount of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value, an impairment loss may be required to write down the related goodwill. 
 A bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the cost of an acquisition. Determining fair value is subjective, requiring the use of estimates, assumptions and management judgement. Bargain purchase gain is recorded as noninterest income in the period it was generated. An acquirer has a measurement period to finalize the accounting for a business combination which could adjust bargain purchase gain if material facts or circumstances arise. 
 Loans Acquired in a Business Combination 
 Acquired loans are classified as either (i) purchase credit-deteriorated PCD loans or (ii) purchased performing loans and are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. 
 PCD loans are those for which there is more than insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since origination. When determining fair value as of the date of acquisition, PCD loans are aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics such as loan type, date of origination, and evidence of credit quality deterioration based on internal risk grades and past due and nonaccrual status. At the acquisition 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 date, the ACL is determined and added to the fair value of the loan to determine the new amortized cost basis. The difference between the new amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance is either a noncredit discount or premium that will be amortized or accredited into the interest income over the remaining life of the loan. Disposals of loans, which may include sale of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in full or in part from the borrower or foreclosure of the collateral, result in removal of the loan from the PCD loan portfolio at its carrying amount. 
 The Company accounts for purchased performing loans using the contractual cash flows method of recognizing discount accretion based on the acquired loans contractual cash flows. Purchased performing loans are recorded at fair value including a credit discount. The fair value discount is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated lives of the loans. Purchased performing loans do not have a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination and have an ACL established in a manner that is consistent with the Company originated loans. The allowance for PCD loans is determined based upon the Company s methodology for estimating the allowance under CECL, and is recorded as an adjustment to the acquired loan balance on the date of acquisition. Additionally, upon the purchase or acquisition of non-PCD loans, the Company measures and records a reserve for credit losses based on the Company s methodology for determining the allowance under CECL. The allowance for non-PCD loans is recorded through a charge to provision for credit losses in the period in which the loans were purchased or acquired. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with required accounting guidance. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the expected amount most likely to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of a sufficient level of future taxable income, recoverable taxes paid in prior years and tax planning strategies. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence before determining if a valuation allowance is deemed necessary regarding the realization of deferred tax assets. 
 The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties as a component of tax expense. 
 The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes in the reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against the Company. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company remains subject to examination for tax years ending on or after December 31, 2020.

 OVERVIEW 
 The Company s net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 11.2 million or 0.34 per diluted common share, which was equal to the second quarter of 2024. The Company had a net loss of 9.7 million or (0.29) per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2023, as a result of the merger with TCFC. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was 30.6 million or 0.92 per diluted common share, compared to net income for the first nine months of 2023 of 738 thousand or 0.03 per diluted common share. 
 Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Highlights 
 Return on Average Assets ROAA - The Company reported ROAA of 0.77 for the third quarter of 2024, which was equal to reported ROAA for the second quarter of 2024.

 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin - Third quarter 2024 net interest income increased 1.1 million to 43.3 million from 42.1 million in the second quarter of 2024. Net interest income increased due to modest loan growth, slightly higher accelerated accretion income, and loans and securities repricing at a faster pace than the Bank s cost of funds. Net interest margin NIM increased six basis points bps to 3.17 for the third quarter of 2024, from 3.11 for the second quarter of 2024. Excluding net accretion interest income of 4.5 million and 3.8 million for the same time periods, NIM increased one bp to 2.84 for the third quarter of 2024, from 2.83 for the second quarter of 2024. 
 Asset Quality - Allowance for credit losses ACL was 58.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 58.5 million at June 30, 2024. The third quarter of 2024 ACL as a percentage of loans remained stable at 1.24 from the second quarter of 2024. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.27 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.29 for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.23 for the fourth quarter of 2023. Classified assets to total assets increased to 0.39 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.33 for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.25 for the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Operating Leverage - The third quarter of 2024 efficiency ratio was 67.49 when compared to 66.23 in the second quarter of 2024. The third quarter efficiency ratio was affected by one-time data processing expense related to the fraud incident in the first quarter of 2024. The third quarter of 2024 non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 62.10 when compared to 61.05 in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Deposits - Total deposits increased to 5.23 billion at September 30, 2024 from 5.15 billion at June 30, 2024 . Average noninterest bearing deposits were 1.58 billion for the third quarter of 2024 representing 30.55 of average funding, excluding subordinated debt, compared to 28.42 during the second quarter of 2024. The Bank s use of wholesale funding, which includes Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances and brokered deposits, has been minimal in 2024. Wholesale funding increased from 44.5 million or 0.74 of assets at December 31, 2023 to 50.0 million or 0.84 of total assets at September 30, 2024. Sustained efforts to enhance the Bank s deposit franchise are expected to continue to attract additional deposits in future quarters.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 The Company reported net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 11.2 million or 0.34 diluted earnings per common share compared to a net loss of 9.7 million or diluted earnings per common share of (0.29) for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Interest Income 
 Tax-equivalent net interest income is net interest income adjusted for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. As shown in the table below, tax-equivalent net interest income was 43.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 45.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest on deposits, a decrease in interest on deposits with other banks and an increase in interest on long-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans, all significantly impacted by the merger with TCFC in the third quarter of 2023.

 Fluctuations in net interest income can result from the combination of changes in the average balances of asset and liability categories and changes in interest rates. Interest rates earned and paid are affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by competitive factors, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 
 Net interest income was 43.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 45.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest on deposits of 5.4 million, a decrease in interest on deposits with other banks of 649 thousand and an increase in interest on long-term borrowings of 618 thousand. These changes were partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans of 4.3 million. 
 The Company s NIM decreased to 3.17 for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.35 for the third quarter of 2023. Comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023, the Company s interest-earning asset yields increased 23 basis points to 5.47 from 5.24 , while the cost of funds repriced at a faster pace resulting in an increase of 43 basis points to 2.38 from 1.95 for the same period. 
 Provision for Credit Losses PCL and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 See discussion of the Bank s PCL and ACL in the asset quality discussion in the analysis of financial condition in this MD A. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Total noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 7.3 million, a decrease of 7.7 million from 15.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower trust and investment fee income of 1.1 million. and a one time third quarter 2023 bargain purchase gain of 8.8 million, partially offset by 2.2 million of losses on sale of investment securities, a direct result of the merger with TCFC in the third quarter of 2023.

 Noninterest Expense 
 Total noninterest expense of 34.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 13.0 million when compared to the third quarter of 2023 total noninterest expense of 47.2 million. The decrease in total noninterest expense from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to one time merger related expenses that were incurred in 2023, partially offset by an increase in expenses due to the operation of a larger branch network and employee base due to the merger with TCFC, which significantly impacted almost all expense line items. In addition, despite the increased size, the Company has prudently reduced its staff by approximately 72 FTEs since the consummation of the merger. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company reported income tax expense of 3.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, and income tax benefit of 5.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 25.24 and (33.89 ), respectively. The third quarter 2023 tax rate was impacted by a net pre-tax loss, nondeductible merger costs, and reassessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities at an estimated effective tax rate due to an adjustment to state apportionment.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 The Company reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 30.6 million or diluted earnings per share of 0.92 compared to net income of 738 thousand or diluted earnings per share of 0.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s ROAA, Non-GAAP ROAA, ROACE and ROATCE were 0.70 , 0.91 , 7.84 and 12.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.02 , 0.49 , 0.24 and 6.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The increase to net income in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the merger with TCFC, which resulted in higher net interest income and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense, higher income tax expense and lower noninterest income. The increase in net interest income was impacted by higher average balances and yields earned on average earning assets, partially offset by higher average balances and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2024 was due to higher levels of reserves required by the Company s CECL model related to the merger in 2023 and recognition of provision on acquired loans. Almost all noninterest expense line items in 2024 increased as a result of the merger and the expanded operations of the newly combined Company.

The increase in net interest income when compared to the prior period was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans of 1.40 billion, or 42.3 . The increase in interest income was partially offset by increased total interest expense of 43.2 million, or 87.9 , primarily due to increases in the cost of funds and in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of 1.02 billion, or 38.1 , and an increase in net accretion interest of 5.5 million. All of the noted increases were significantly impacted by the merger.

 The Company s net interest margin remained flat at 3.12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, as more rapid increases in rates on interest-bearing liabilities were offset by lower increases in interest-earning asset yields and larger balances in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increases in the average balance and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits of 1.02 billion and 104 bps, respectively, were partially offset by increases in the average balance and yields earned on average earning assets of 1.40 billion and 64 bps, respectively. Additionally, margins were positively impacted as average balances of noninterest-bearing deposits increased 424.9 million, or 43.2 , from 25.9 of average funding for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 27.2 of average funding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net accretion income impacted net interest margin by 29 bps and 21 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Until the balance sheet restructuring in the third quarter of 2023, the net interest margin experienced compression due to the Company s liability sensitive position, deposit rate pressures and significantly higher FHLB borrowing rates.

 See discussion of the Bank s PCL and ACL in the asset quality discussion in the analysis of financial condition in this MD A. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Total noninterest income of 22.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.3 million, or 13.0 , when compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower trust and investment fee income of 1.1 million. The decrease was affected by one-time bargain purchase income of 8.8 million and 2.2 million of losses on sale of investment securities in the third quarter 2023, both a direct result of the merger with TCFC in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Total noninterest expense of 104.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14.6 million, or 16.3 , when compared to the same period in 2023. Almost all noninterest expense line items increased as a result of the merger with TCFC and the expanded operations of the newly combined Company and 4.7 million of credit card related fraud losses. There were no merger-related expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company continues to focus on streamlining processes to unlock operational efficiencies and reduce overall noninterest expenses. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company reported income tax expense of 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and income tax benefit of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 24.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and (329.12) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by nondeductible merger costs incurred.

 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Balance Sheet Summary 
 Total assets were 5.92 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 93.2 million, or 1.6 , when compared to 6.01 billion at December 31, 2023. The aggregate decrease was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents of 188.8 million and investment securities held to maturity HTM of 28.6 million partially offset by an increase in investment securities available for sale AFS of 22.8 million and loans held for investment of 92.9 million. The ratios of the ACL on loans to total loans were 1.24 and 1.24 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents totaled 183.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 372.4 million at December 31, 2023. Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate due to transactions in process and other liquidity demands. Management believes liquidity needs are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional and wholesale funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year. 
 Investment Securities 
 The investment portfolio includes debt and equity securities. Securities are classified as either AFS or HTM. AFS investment securities are stated at estimated fair value based on market prices. They represent securities which may be sold as part of the asset/liability management strategy or in response to changing interest rates. Net unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are reported net of related income taxes as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity. Investment securities in the HTM category are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts and the ACL. We have the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity. At September 30, 2024, 21.6 of the portfolio of debt securities was classified as AFS and 78.4 was classified as HTM, compared to 17.7 and 82.3 respectively, at December 31, 2023. See Note 3 Investment Securities , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the composition of our investment portfolio. 
 Investment securities, including restricted stock and equity securities, totaled 644.2 million at September 30, 2024, a 3.2 million, or 0.5 , decrease compared to 647.4 million at December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, AFS securities, carried at fair value, totaled 133.3 million compared to 110.5 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, AFS securities consisted of 79.7 mortgage-backed, 15.5 U.S. Government agencies and 4.8 corporate bonds, compared to 76.0 , 18.5 and 5.5 , respectively, at year-end 2023. At September 30, 2024, the accumulated other comprehensive loss was 5.5 million, compared to 7.5 million at December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, HTM securities, carried at amortized cost, totaled 484.7 million compared to 513.3 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, HTM securities consisted of 70.1 mortgage-backed, 27.4 U.S. Government agencies, 2.2 other debt securities, and 0.3 states and political subdivisions, compared to 69.7 , 27.9 , 2.0 and 0.3 , respectively, at year-end 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 97.0 and 97.1 , respectively, of the Bank s carrying value of its investment portfolio consisted of securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or government-sponsored agencies. 
 The Company monitors the credit quality of HTM securities through credit ratings provided by Standard Poor s Rating Services and Moody s Investor Services. Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security, and are updated at each quarter end. Investment grade securities are rated BBB- or higher by S P and Baa3 or higher by Moody s and are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be of low credit risk. Conversely, securities rated below investment grade, which are labeled as speculative grade by the rating agencies, are considered to have distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade securities. There were no speculative grade HTM securities at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. HTM securities that are not rated are agency mortgage-backed securities sponsored by U.S. government agencies, as well as direct obligations of the agencies, with the remainder being sub-debt of other banks.

 Loans 
 Loans Held for Sale

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the fair value of loans held for sale amounted to 26.9 million and 8.8 million, respectively. The Bank makes certain representations to purchasers in the sale of the mortgage loans related to loan ownership, loan compliance and legality, and accurate documentation. If a loan is found to be out of compliance with any of the representations subsequent to the date of purchase, the Bank may be required to repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser.

 Our loan portfolio has a CRE concentration, which is generally defined as a combination of certain construction and CRE loans. The federal banking regulators have issued guidance for those institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in CRE lending. Pursuant to the supervisory criteria contained in the guidance for identifying institutions with a potential CRE concentration risk, institutions which have (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land acquisitions which represent 100 or more of an institution s total risk-based capital; or (2) total non-owner occupied CRE loans representing 300 or more of the institution s total risk-based capital and the institution s non-owner occupied CRE loan portfolio (including construction) has increased 50 or more during the prior 36 months are identified as having potential CRE concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in CRE

 lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their CRE portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. The Bank has a concentration in CRE loans, and has experienced significant growth in its CRE portfolio in recent years and was further impacted with its acquisition of CBTC in the third quarter of 2023. Non-owner occupied CRE loans as an amount and as a percentage of the Bank s Tier 1 Capital + ACL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 2.07 billion or 364.0 and 2.02 billion or 382.6 , respectively. Construction loans as an amount and as a percentage of the Bank s Tier 1 Capital + ACL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 337.1 million or 59.3 and 299.0 million or 56.7 , respectively. 
 The CRE portfolio (including construction) has increased significantly in the past two years. Management has extensive experience in CRE lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened risk management procedures, as well as strong underwriting criteria with respect to its CRE portfolio. Monitoring practices include stress testing analysis to evaluate changes in collateral values and to cash flows from interest rate increases and declines in net operating income. We may be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of our CRE concentrations, which could require us to obtain additional capital or to sell/participate portions of loans, which may adversely affect stockholder returns.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 Classified assets increased 8.4 million to 23.3 million or 0.39 of total assets at September 30, 2024 from 14.9 million or 0.25 of total assets at December 31, 2023. Classified assets are substandard loans, repossessed assets and OREO. The increase was primarily due to increases in OREO and repossessed assets of 0.3 million and 8.1 million in substandard loans. 
 As shown in the following table, nonperforming assets were 15.8 million or 0.27 of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared to 13.7 million or 0.23 of total assets at December 31, 2023. The balance of nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to decreases in total loans 90 days or more past due of 0.3 million and repossessed assets and OREO of 0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in nonaccrual loans of 2.1 million.

 Total deposits decreased 160.4 million, or 3.0 , to 5.23 billion at September 30, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to a decrease in demand deposits of 414.0 million, and money market and savings of 143.8 million. The decrease in deposits is attributable to seasonal municipal runoff and a decrease in interest rate-sensitive cannabis-related deposits. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits was significantly impacted by a transfer of 399.4 million of demand deposits which carried an average rate of four bps during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Total estimated uninsured deposits were 895.9 million or 17.1 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and 1.05 billion or 19.5 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there were 127.4 million included in uninsured deposits that the Bank secured using the market value of pledged collateral. The Bank's uninsured deposits, excluding the market value of pledged collateral, at September 30, 2024 were 768.6 million or 14.7 of total deposits. Reciprocal deposits were 1.29 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.29 billion at December 31, 2023. Reciprocal deposits as a percentage of the Bank s liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 24.3 and 23.8 , respectively. 
 The Bank is required to monitor large deposit relationships and concentration risks in accordance with regulatory guidance. This includes monitoring deposit concentrations and maintaining fund management policies and strategies that take into account potentially volatile concentrations and significant deposits that mature simultaneously. Regulatory guidance defines a large depositor as a customer or entity that owns or controls 2 or more of the Bank s total deposits. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had three local municipal customer deposit relationships that exceeded 2 of total deposits, totaling 477.3 million, which represented 9.1 of total deposits of 5.23 billion. At December 31, 2023, there were four customer deposit relationships that exceeded 2 of total deposits, totaling 598.5 million, which represented 11.1 of total deposits of 5.40 billion. 
 Wholesale Funding - Short-Term Borrowings and Brokered Deposits 
 The Company had no short-term borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Short-term advances are defined as those with original maturities of one year or less. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no securities sold under agreements to repurchase or overnight borrowings from correspondent banks. 
 The Company s wholesale funding increased 5.5 million, which includes FHLB advances and brokered deposits, from 44.5 million in brokered deposits at December 31, 2023 to 50.0 million in FHLB advances at September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Long-Term Debt 
 The Company occasionally borrows from the FHLB to meet longer term liquidity needs, specifically to fund loan growth when liquidity from deposit growth is not sufficient. There were long-term borrowings from the FHLB outstanding at September 30, 2024 of 50.0 million and zero at December 31, 2023. This increase was due to a purchase of 50 million in FHLB advances for 18-months at 4.79 which was lower than short-term FHLB advances of 5.57 . These advances have the option to be called by FHLB at any time and mature on November 7, 2025. 
 On August 25, 2020, the Company entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the Company issued and sold 25.0 million in aggregate principal amount with an initial interest rate of 5.375 of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due September 1, 2030. 
 As a result of the merger with Severn Bancorp, Inc., effective October 31, 2021, the Company acquired Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due in 2035 which had an outstanding principal balance of 20.6 million. The debt balances of 18.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 18.6 million at December 31, 2023 were presented net of fair value adjustments of 1.9 million and 2.0 million, respectively. 
 Additionally, as a result of the TCFC merger, the Company acquired Junior Subordinated Debt Securities which had an outstanding principal balance of 12.4 million. The debt balance of 11.0 million at September 30, 2024 was presented net of a fair value adjustment of 1.3 million. In addition, the Company acquired 4.75 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes with a carrying value of 19.5 million at September 30, 2024. The notes aggregate balance of 18.8 million at September 30, 2024 was presented net of fair value adjustment of 700 thousand.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise. Cash needs may come from loan demand, deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities. Potential obligations, resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers, are other factors affecting our liquidity needs. Many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position. 
 The Company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank s most liquid assets are cash, cash equivalents and federal funds sold. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank s operating, financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows. Customer deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the Bank s lending and investment activities. 
 Based on management s going concern evaluation, we believe that there are no conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s or the Bank s ability to continue as a going concern, within one year of the date of the issuance of the financial statements. 
 The Bank s principal sources of funds for investment and operations are net income, deposits, sales of loans, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, principal and interest received on investment securities and proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities. The Bank s principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans, the purchase of securities and the payment of maturing deposits. 
 The Bank s most liquid assets are cash, cash equivalents and federal funds sold. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank s operating, financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows. 
 Liquidity is provided by access to funding sources, which include core depositors and brokered deposits. Other sources of funds include our ability to borrow, such as purchasing federal funds from correspondent banks, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase and advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. The Bank uses wholesale funding (brokered deposits and other sources of funds) to supplement funding when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth and for asset-liability management purposes. 
 We derive liquidity through increased customer deposits, non-reinvestment of the cash flow from the investment portfolio, loan repayments, borrowings and income from earning assets. As seen in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was 188.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to an increase of 53.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to the decrease of 474.8 million in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of 313.4 million in noninterest-bearing deposits. 
 To the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand, liquidity needs can be met in the short-term fund markets. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had approximately 1.12 billion of available liquidity including: 183.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, 321.2 million in unpledged securities, 742.4 million in secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Atlanta offset by FHLB advances and letter of credit of 50.0 million and 81.1 million, respectively. The Bank has arrangements with other correspondent banks whereby it has 95.0 million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short-term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the Bank s portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash. Through the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank had available lendable collateral of approximately 742.4 million and 745.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank has pledged, under a blanket lien, all qualifying residential and commercial real estate loans under borrowing agreements with the FHLB of Atlanta. 
 The Bank and the Company are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank and the Company to maintain minimum ratios of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital as a percentage of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, adjusted for risk weights ranging from 0 to 12.50 . The Bank and Company are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on quarterly average assets, which is known as the leverage ratio. The Bank was deemed well capitalized under applicable regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2024.

 The Bank and Company were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements to which they were subject, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations.

 For information on risks relating to liquidity, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Liquidity Risk, as presented in the Company's 2023 Annual Report. 
 The Company provides banking services to customers who do business in the cannabis industry. While the Company is providing banking services to customers that are engaged in the growing, processing, and sales of cannabis in a manner that complies with applicable state law, such customers engaged in those activities currently violate Federal laws. The Company may be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the services that it provides to these customers. While we are not aware of any instance of a federally-insured financial institution being subject to such aiding and abetting liability, the strict enforcement of Federal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in the Company s inability to continue to provide banking services to these customers and the Company could have legal action taken against it by the Federal government, including imprisonment and fines. There is an uncertainty of the potential impact to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements if the Federal government takes actions against the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not accrued an amount for the potential impact of any such actions. 
 Following is a summary of the level of business activities with our cannabis industry customers: 
 Deposit and loan balances at September 30, 2024 were approximately 134.0 million, or 2.6 of total deposits, and 75.1 million, or 1.6 of total gross loans, respectively. 
 Interest income and noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 2.9 million and 813 thousand, respectively.

 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Statements in the MD A include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. The Company s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures and believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. See Non-GAAP reconciliation schedules that immediately follow: 
 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES (UNAUDITED) 
 Reconciliation of GAAP total assets, common equity, common equity to assets and book value to non-GAAP tangible assets, tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible book value. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the accompanying financial statement tables, contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. This financial information includes certain performance measures, which exclude intangible assets. These non-GAAP measures are included because the Company believes they may provide useful supplemental information for evaluating the underlying performance trends of the Company.

 Return on Average Common Equity ROACE 
 The ROACE is a financial ratio that measures the profitability of a company in relation to the average stockholders' equity. This financial metric is expressed in the form of a percentage which is equal to net income after tax divided by the average stockholders' equity for a specific period of time.

 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity ROATCE 
 ROATCE is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common stockholders by average tangible common shareholders' equity. Management believes that ROATCE is meaningful because it measures the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or internally developed. ROATCE is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

 Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation, and management has procedures in place to evaluate and mitigate this risk. This risk and these procedures are discussed in Part II, Item 7A of the 2023 Annual Report under the caption Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . Management recognizes that recent changes in interest rates have had an impact on the Company s market risk. The procedures used to evaluate and mitigate these risks remain unchanged, and we continue to monitor our actual and simulated sensitivity positions since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4 Controls and Procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act with the SEC, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in those rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including Shore Bancshares, Inc. s principal executive officer PEO and its principal financial officer PFO ), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the PEO and the PFO. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the PEO and the PFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level at September 30, 2024 due to the material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management assessed the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. This assessment was conducted based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses identified below. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management previously disclosed a material weakness in relation to deferred income taxes discussed in Part I, Item 4 of the Company s Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which has been fully remediated as reported in Part I, Item 4 of the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 Management previously disclosed a material weakness caused by improperly designed preventative controls and insufficient monitoring controls of the online credit card account opening process, which resulted in a material fraud loss, as discussed in Part I, Item 4 of the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. As described below, management expects the remediation of the online credit card account opening material weakness will be completed prior to the end of 2024. 
 Management previously disclosed a material weakness associated with ineffective input review controls relating to specific aspects of the Company s ACL model discussed in Part II, Item 9A of the 2023 Annual Report. As described below, management continues to follow its remediation plan with respect to the review of controls related to the allowance for credit losses and expects the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of 2024. 
 Remediation Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses 
 In response to the material weaknesses identified above, the Company is in the process of implementing changes to its internal control over financial reporting, with oversight of the Audit Committee. 
 Specifically in relation to the material weakness identified related to the online credit card account opening process, remediation began immediately upon detection on April 1, 2024, by completely closing the online application portal and suspending the opening of all new credit card accounts using the automated online account opening application hosted by the Company s third party credit card processor.

Table of Contents 

 The Company reviewed all accounts opened on or after February 1, 2024, and closed those deemed to be fraudulent including all accounts/cards opened on or after March 28, 2024, to ensure no additional loss to the Bank. The Company is evaluating whether to sell and exit the credit card issuer program. We expect that the remediation of the online credit card account opening material weakness will be completed prior to the end of 2024. 
 Specifically in relation to the allowance for credit losses, management has continued to follow the remediation plan outlined in the 2023 Annual Report. According to the plan management compiled a detailed inventory of significant inputs to the allowance for credit losses calculation and, reevaluating the relevant SOX control design and operation to ensure all significant inputs to the allowance for credit losses calculation are recorded timely and accurately. In addition, management also conducted a detailed data audit to ensure the completeness and accuracy of select inputs to the allowance for credit losses calculation. We expect that the allowance for credit losses material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of 2024. 
 Management will consider the material weaknesses remediated once the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above, there were no additional changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
