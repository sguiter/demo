respectively, of customer reimbursement balances of pass-through claims, which are fully offset in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Accounts receivable also include accruals and trade receivables for program management and processing fees that have terms pursuant
to their related contracts. 

and , respectively, in excess of federally insured bank account limits. In February of 2024, the Company initiated
a program with one of our financial institutions called deposit swapping, where the financial institution utilizes a third-party who is
participating in reciprocal deposit networks. This program is an alternative way for our financial institution to offer us full Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance on deposits over 250,000. Under this program, deposit networks divide uninsured
deposits into smaller units and distribute these monies among participating banks in the network, where the monies are fully FDIC insured. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had
a concentration of accounts receivable risk. Two pharma program customers associated with our pharma patient affordability programs each
individually represented and of our accounts receivable balance. Two pharma program customers each individually represented 
and of our accounts receivable balance on December 31, 2023. These accounts receivable balances relate to passthrough claim reimbursements
that have been paid on behalf of the pharma program customers. 

. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements
are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements. Expenditures
for property betterments and renewals are capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition of a depreciable asset, cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in other income (expense). 

The Company periodically evaluates whether events
and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance
of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over
the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability. 

. 

Internally Developed Software Costs 
Computer software development costs are expensed as incurred, except for internal use software or website development costs that qualify
for capitalization as described below, and include compensation and related expenses, costs of hardware and software, and costs incurred
in developing features and functionality. 

For computer software developed or obtained for
internal use, costs that are incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of software development are expensed as
incurred. Costs incurred during the application and development stage are capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line
method over a three year estimated useful life, beginning in the period in which the software is available for use. 

Contract Assets Incremental
costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer are capitalized. The Company determines the costs that are incremental by confirming
the costs (i) are directly related to a customer s contract, (ii) generate or enhance resources to fulfill contract performance
obligations in the future, and (iii) are recoverable. Amortization is on a straight-line basis generally over , beginning
when goods and services are transferred to the customer or group of customers. 

Hosting Implementation 
Costs to implement the cloud computing arrangements (the hosting site are accounted for by following the same model as
internally developed software costs. Costs that are incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of hosting development
are expensed when they are incurred. Costs incurred during the application and development stage are capitalized. Capitalized costs are
amortized using the straight-line method over a estimated useful life, beginning in the period when the hosting site is available
for use. 

The portion of the dollar value of prepaid-stored
value cards that consumers do not ultimately redeem are referred to as breakage. In certain card programs where we hold the cardholder
funds and expect to be entitled to a breakage amount, we recognize revenue using estimated breakage rates ratably over the estimated card
life; provided that a significant reversal of the amount of breakage revenue recognized is not probable, and record adjustments to such
estimates when redemption is remote or we are legally defeased of the obligation, if applicable. For each program, we utilize a third
party to estimate breakage rates based on historical redemption patterns, market-specific trends, escheatment rules and existing economic
conditions. The Company accounts for breakage in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-04, Liabilities Extinguishment
of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Cards for the recognition of such revenue.
Breakage revenue is recorded in other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and was and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Breakage revenue was for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The Company utilizes the remote method of revenue
recognition for settlement income whereby the unspent balances will be recognized as revenue at the expiration of the cards or the respective
card program. This has primarily been associated with the pharma prepaid business which ended in 2022. The Company records all revenue
on a gross basis since it is the primary obligor and establishes the price in the contract arrangement with its customers. The Company
is currently under no obligation to refund any fees, and the Company does not currently have any obligations for disputed claim settlements.
Given the nature of the Company s services and contracts, generally it has no contract assets. Settlement income was for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of revenues is comprised of transaction processing
fees, data connectivity and data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production and postage costs, customer service, program
management, application integration setup, fraud charges, and sales and commission expense. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through
enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in the ASU require, among other things, disclosure of significant
segment expenses that are regularly provided to an entity's chief operating decision maker CODM and a description of other
segment items by reportable segment, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses
the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Annual disclosures
are required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim disclosures are required for periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is required, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
effect the updated guidance will have on the Company's financial statement disclosures as the Company has a single reportable segment.

insurance policy, for the referenced class of purchasers, and scheduled a final approval hearing for April 17, 2024. On April 17, 2024,
the Court conducted the final approval hearing and approved the settlement and, on April 18, 2024, issued an order and final judgment
thereon. 

The Company has also been named as a nominal defendant
in four stockholder derivative actions currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. The first-filed
derivative action is entitled Andrzej Toczek, derivatively on behalf of Paysign, Inc. v. Mark R. Newcomer, et al. and was filed on September
17, 2020. This action alleges violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste,
largely in connection with the failure to correct information technology controls over financial reporting alleged in the Securities Class
Action, thereby causing the Company to face exposure in the Securities Class Action. The complaint also alleges insider trading violations
against certain individual defendants. The second-filed derivative action is entitled John K. Gray, derivatively on behalf of Paysign,
Inc. v. Mark Attinger, et al. and was filed on May 9, 2022. This action involves the same alleged conduct raised in the Toczek action
and asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with financial reporting, breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged
insider trading against certain individual defendants, and unjust enrichment. On June 3, 2022, the Court approved a stipulation staying
the action until the Court in the consolidated Securities Class Action issued a ruling on the Motion to Dismiss. On May 10, 2023, the
Toczek and Gray actions were consolidated. 

The Company has also been named as a nominal defendant
in a third stockholder derivative action initially filed in state court in Clark County, Nevada, on October 2, 2023, entitled Simone Blanchette,
derivatively on behalf of Paysign, Inc. v. Mark Newcomer, et al, which the defendants subsequently removed to federal district court in
Nevada pursuant to a Notice of Removal filed on October 10, 2023. That complaint makes substantially the same allegations as made in the
consolidated Toczek and Gray actions, and also contains a claim that the individual defendants violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder. On December 7, 2023, the parties requested that the action be stayed for sixty days due to the settlement negotiations in
the consolidated Toczek and Gray actions, and the Court granted the sixty-day stay on December 11, 2023. Subsequently, the Court extended
that deadline to March 29, 2024 and then to May 29, 2024 based upon the parties stipulations. 

The Company has also been named as a nominal defendant
in a fourth stockholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, filed on December 27, 2023,
entitled Mo Jeewa, derivatively on behalf of Paysign, Inc. v. Mark R. Newcomer, et al. That complaint makes substantially the same allegations
as made in the consolidated Toczek and Gray actions and the Blanchette action discussed above, and alleges breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment. 

On October 4, 2024, the parties to the four shareholder
derivative actions agreed to a mediator s proposal to settle all four actions. The parties are currently in the process of documenting
that settlement and intend to submit the proposed settlement to the district court for approval pursuant to Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. 

The four shareholder derivative actions settled
by the Company agree to certain corporate therapeutics and the payment of a total of in attorneys fees split among counsel
in all four of the existing derivative actions, which will be paid by the Company s insurer.

scalability allowing our clients and partners to leverage these advantages for cost savings and revenue opportunities. 

Our suite of product offerings includes solutions
for corporate rewards, prepaid gift cards, general purpose reloadable debit cards, employee incentives, consumer rebates, donor compensation,
clinical trials, healthcare reimbursement payments and pharmaceutical payment assistance, and demand deposit accounts accessible with
a debit card. In the future, we expect to further expand our product into other prepaid card offerings such as travel cards and expense
reimbursement cards. Our cards are sponsored by our issuing bank partners. 

Our revenues include fees generated from cardholder
fees, interchange, card program management fees, transaction claims processing fees, breakage, and settlement income. Revenue from cardholder
fees, interchange, card program management fees, and transaction claims processing fees is recorded when the performance obligation is
fulfilled. Breakage is recorded ratably over the estimated card life based on historical redemption patterns, market-specific trends,
escheatment rules, and existing economic conditions and relates solely to our open-loop gift card business which began at the end of 2022.
Settlement income is recorded at the expiration of the card or card program and relates primarily to our pharma prepaid business which
ended in 2022. 

We have two categories for our prepaid debit cards:
(1) corporate and consumer reloadable cards, and (2) non-reloadable cards. 

Reloadable Cards: These types of cards are generally
classified as payroll or considered general purpose reloadable GPR cards. Payroll cards are issued by an employer to an
employee in order to allow the employee to access payroll amounts that are deposited into an account linked to their card. GPR cards can
also be issued to a consumer at a retail location or mailed to a consumer after completing an on-line application. GPR cards can be reloaded
multiple times with a consumer s payroll, government benefit, a federal or state tax refund or through cash reload networks located
at retail locations. Reloadable cards are generally open-loop cards as described below. 

Non-Reloadable Cards: These are generally one-time
use cards that are only active until the funds initially loaded to the card are spent. These types of cards are generally used as gift
or incentive cards. Typically, these types of cards are used for the purchase of goods or services at retail locations and cannot be used
to receive cash. 

Both reloadable and non-reloadable cards may be
open-loop, closed-loop, or restricted-loop. Open-loop cards can be used to receive cash at ATM locations by PIN; or purchase goods or
services by PIN or signature at retail locations virtually anywhere that the network brand (American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa,
etc.) is accepted. Closed-loop cards can only be used at a specific merchant. Restricted-loop cards can be used at several merchants,
or a defined group of merchants, such as all merchants at a specific shopping mall. 

The prepaid card market in the United States has
experienced significant growth in recent years due to consumers and merchants embracing improved technology, greater convenience, more
product choices and greater flexibility. Prepaid cards have also proven to be an attractive alternative to traditional bank accounts for
certain segments of the population, particularly those without, or who could not qualify for, a checking or savings account. 

We manage all aspects of the prepaid card lifecycle,
from managing the card design and approval processes with partners and networks, to production, packaging, distribution, and personalization.
We also oversee inventory and security controls, renewals, lost and stolen card management, and replacement. We employ a 24/7/365 fully
staffed, in-house customer service department which utilizes bilingual customer service representatives, Interactive Voice Response, and
two-way short message service messaging and text alerts. 

Currently, we are focusing our marketing efforts
on corporate incentive and expense prepaid card products in various market verticals including but not limited to general corporate expense,
healthcare related markets including patient affordability solutions, clinical trials and donor compensation, loyalty rewards, and incentive
cards.

As part of our continuing platform expansion process,
we evaluate current and emerging technologies for applicability to our existing and future software platform. To this end, we engage with
various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology
components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized
business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints. Our principal target markets for
processing services include prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers, small third-party processors, and small and mid-size
financial institutions in the United States and Mexico. 

We have devoted more extensive resources to sales
and marketing activities as we have added essential personnel to our marketing, sales and support teams. We market our Paysign payment
solutions through direct marketing by the Company s sales team. Our primary market focus is on companies that require a streamlined
payment solution for rewards, rebates, payment assistance, and other payments to their customers, employees, agents and others. To reach
these markets, we focus our sales efforts on direct contact with our target market and attendance at various industry specific conferences.
We may, at times, utilize independent contractors who make direct sales and are paid commissions and/or restricted stock awards. We market
our Paysign premier product through existing communication channels to a targeted segment of our existing cardholders, as well as to a
broad group of individuals, ranging from non-banked to fully banked consumers with a focus on long term users of our product. 

In 2024, we plan to continue to invest additional
funds in technology improvements, sales and marketing, cybersecurity, fraud, customer service, and regulatory compliance. From time to
time, we evaluate raising capital to enable us to diversify into new market verticals. If we do not raise new capital, we believe that
we will still be able to support our existing business and expand into new vertical markets using internally generated funds.

The increase in total revenues of 2,856,106 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year consisted primarily of a 377,822 increase in
plasma revenue, a 2,248,618 increase in pharma revenue, and a 229,666 increase in other revenue. The increase in plasma revenue was
primarily due to the addition of 16 net new plasma centers since September 30, 2023 and rise in the number of donations at existing plasma
centers, and, consequently, dollars loaded to cards, cardholder fees, and interchange, as there continues to be an increase in demand
for plasma driven by global increases in plasma protein therapies. The increase in pharma revenue was primarily due to the launch of 32
net new pharma patient affordability programs since September 30, 2023 and the subsequent growth in monthly management and setup fees,
claim processing fees, and other billable services such as call center support. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the
growth and usage in the number of cardholders of our payroll, retail, and corporate incentive programs. 

Cost of revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2024 increased 714,910 compared to the same period in the prior year. Cost of revenues is comprised of transaction processing fees,
data connectivity and data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production and postage costs, customer service, program management,
application integration setup, and sales and commission expense. The increase in cost of revenues consisted primarily of (i) increased
customer care expense of approximately 293,000 associated with the growth in our business, wage inflation pressures, a tight labor market,
and increased benefit costs; (ii) increased third-party program management of approximately 173,000 associated with our pharma revenue;
(iii) increased sales commission expense of approximately 175,000 related to the increase in overall revenue for programs in which we
pay commission expenses; (iv) increased fraud charges of approximately 123,000; and (v) and increased network fees of approximately 34,000,
which was driven predominantly by increased ATM network usage associated with growth in our card programs and increases in transaction
fees related to inflationary pressures. These increases were offset by a decline in postage of approximately 42,000 and a decline in
plastics and collateral of approximately 36,000. 

Gross profit for the three months ended September
30, 2024 increased 2,141,196 compared to the same period in the prior year, resulting primarily from the increase in plasma revenue and
the beneficial impact of a variable cost structure, as many of the plasma transaction costs are variable in nature and are provided by
third-parties who charge us based on the number of active cards outstanding and transactions that occurred during the period. Gross profit
also benefited from the growth in our pharma patient affordability business. The increase in gross profit was offset by price increases
from many of our third-party service providers, and an increase in customer service and fraud expenses mentioned above. The increase in
gross margin resulted from the aforementioned factors. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,521,335 compared to the same period in the prior year and consisted primarily
of an increase in (i) compensation and benefits of approximately 1,821,000 due to continued hiring to support the Company s growth,
a tight labor market, and increased benefit costs; (ii) technologies and telecom of approximately 279,000 primarily related to ongoing
platform security investments; and (iii) all other operating expenses of approximately 16,000. This increase was offset by a decrease
in stock compensation of approximately 136,000 and an increase of 459,000 in the amount of capitalized platform development costs. 

Depreciation and amortization expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 520,444 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in depreciation and
amortization expense was primarily due to continued capitalization of new software development costs and equipment purchases related to
continued enhancements to our processing platform and employment growth. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we recorded income from operations of 689,849 representing an improvement of 99,417 compared to income from operations of 590,432 during
the same period in the prior year, related to the aforementioned factors. 

Other income for the three months ended September
30, 2024 increased 185,391 primarily related to an increase in interest rates and the associated interest income received on higher average
bank account balances at our sponsor bank. 

At September 30, 2024, our income tax expense
was 53,727, which equates to an effective tax rate of 3.6 primarily as a result of tax benefits
related to our stock-based compensation and changes to the Company s valuation allowance recorded on its net deferred tax assets. 
We recorded an income tax expense of 105,152 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which equates to an effective tax rate of
8.7 primarily as a result of the full valuation on our deferred tax assets in both the current
and prior period and the tax benefit related to our stock-based compensation. 

19 

The net income for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 1,436,837, an improvement of 336,233 compared to the net income of 1,100,604 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The overall change in net income relates to the aforementioned factors.

data connectivity and data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production and postage costs, customer service, program management,
application integration setup, and sales and commission expense. The increase in cost of revenues consisted primarily of (i) increased
network fees of approximately 1,413,000, which was driven predominantly by increased ATM network usage associated with growth in our
card programs and increases in transaction fees related to inflationary pressures; (ii) increased sales commission expense of approximately
 510,000 related to the increase in overall revenue for programs in which we pay commission expenses; (iii) increased customer care expense
of approximately 637,000 associated with the growth in our business, wage inflation pressures, a tight labor market, and increased benefit
costs; (iv) increased fraud charges of approximately 407,000; and (v) and increased third-party program management of approximately 409,000
related to the growth in our pharma patient affordability business. These increases were offset by a decline in plastics and collateral
of approximately 161,000. 

Gross profit for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 increased 6,002,801 compared to the same period in the prior year resulting primarily from the increase in plasma revenue and
the beneficial impact of a variable cost structure, as many of the plasma transaction costs are variable in nature and are provided by
third parties who charge us based on the number of active cards outstanding and transactions that occurred during the period. Gross profit

Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures 

Management reviews a number of metrics to help
us monitor the performance of and identify trends affecting our business. We believe the following measures are the primary indicators
of our quarterly and annual revenues: 

Gross Dollar Volume Loaded on Cards: Represents
the total dollar volume of funds loaded to all of our prepaid card programs. Our gross dollar volume loaded on cards was 456 million
and 448 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross dollar volume loaded on cards was
 1,339 million and 1,232 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We use this metric to analyze the
total amount of money moving into our prepaid card programs. 

Conversion Rates on Gross Dollar Volume Loaded
on Cards: Represents revenues, gross profit or net income conversion rates of gross dollar volume loaded on cards which are calculated
by taking our total revenues, gross profit or net income, respectively, as a numerator and dividing by the gross dollar volume loaded
on cards as a denominator. As we derive a number of our financial results from cardholder fees, we utilize these metrics as an indication
of the amount of money that is added to cards and will eventually be converted to revenues, gross profit and net income. Our total revenue
conversion rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.34 or 334 basis points bps ), and 2.77 
or 277 bps, respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded on cards. Our total gross profit conversion rates for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.86 or 186 bps, and 1.41 or 141 bps, respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded on cards. Our net income conversion
rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.31 or 31 bps, and 0.25 or 25 bps, respectively, of gross dollar
volume loaded on cards. Our total revenue conversion rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.20 or 320 basis
points bps, and 2.73 or 273 bps, respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded on cards. Our total gross profit conversion rates for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.72 or 172 bps, and 1.38 or 138 bps, respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded
on cards. Our net income conversion rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.18 or 18 bps, and 0.07 or 7 bps,
respectively, of gross dollar volume loaded on cards. 

Management also reviews key performance indicators,
such as revenues, gross profit, operational expenses as a percent of revenues, and cardholder participation. In addition, we consider
certain non-GAAP (or adjusted measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for
the periods presented and provide a financial tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information
can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment and investment
in new card programs. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating
and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute
for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined
in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported
by other companies, to be key performance indicators: 

EBITDA is defined as earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and Adjusted EBITDA reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude
stock-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the table below.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we financed our operations through internally generated funds. 

Operating activities provided 8,633,922 of cash
as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 4,453,858 compared to the same period last year. This change in cash flow is primarily due to
increases in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and customer card funding are primarily
related to the growth in our pharma patient affordability business and timing of payments as we are invoiced by third-party service providers
at the end of the period and are due monies from our pharma patient affordability customers to cover these third-party payables. The increase
in cash flows from operating activities was also impacted by net income and non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred
income taxes, stock-based compensation, and lease expenses. 

We used net cash in investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 7,087,867 and 4,999,986, respectively. Cash used for investing activities was primarily
attributed to an increase in the capitalization of internally developed software as we continue to invest in our technology platform. 

Finance activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 used 331,695 in cash, attributable to the repurchase of 100,000 shares of the Company s
common stock at a weighted average price of 3.60 per share offset by proceeds received of 28,800 for the exercise of stock options.
Financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 used 1,118,284 in cash, attributable to the repurchase of 394,558
shares of the Company s common stock at a weighted average price of 2.86 per share offset by proceeds received of 9,600 for the
exercise of stock options. 

Our significant contractual cash requirements
also include ongoing payments for lease liabilities. For additional information regarding our cash commitments and contractual obligations,
see Note 4 LEASE in the notes to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Sources of Liquidity 

Unrestricted cash was 10,293,207 as of September
30, 2024, an increase of 356,580 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from the improvement
in our operating results. We believe that our available cash on hand, excluding restricted cash, at September 30, 2024 of 10,293,207,
along with our forecast for revenues and cash flows for the remainder of 2024 and through the third quarter of 2026, will be sufficient
to sustain our operations for the next 24 months. In light of the elevated interest rates and increased refinancing risks related to commercial
real estate holdings on bank balance sheets, we continue to monitor the health and soundness of our bank relationships through publicly
available information. Based on recent SEC filings, we have not discovered any issues that would cause us to alter our bank relationships.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our significant accounting policies are described
in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Our estimates are based on our experience and
our interpretation of economic, political, regulatory, and other factors that affect our business prospects. Actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates. 

Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

Because we are a smaller reporting company, we
are not required to provide the information called for by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures means controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in those reports is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

The Company has been named as a defendant in three
securities class action complaints filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada: Yilan Shi v. Paysign, Inc. et
al., filed on March 19, 2020 Shi ), Lorna Chase v. Paysign, Inc. et al., filed on March 25, 2020 Chase ),
and Smith Duvall v. Paysign, Inc. et al., filed on April 2, 2020 (collectively, the Complaints or Securities
Class Action ). Smith Duvall v. Paysign, Inc. et al. was voluntarily dismissed on May 21, 2020. On May 18, 2020, the Shi plaintiffs
and another entity called the Paysign Investor Group each filed a motion to consolidate the remaining Shi and Chase actions and to be
appointed lead plaintiff. The Complaints are putative class actions filed on behalf of a class of persons who acquired the Company s
common stock from March 19, 2019 through March 31, 2020, inclusive. The Complaints generally allege that the Company, Mark R. Newcomer,
and Mark Attinger violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and that
Messrs. Newcomer and Attinger violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, by making materially false or misleading statements, or failing
to disclose material facts, regarding the Company s internal control over financial reporting and its financial statements. The
Complaints seek class action certification, compensatory damages, and attorney s fees and costs. On December 2, 2020, the Court
consolidated Shi and Chase as In re Paysign, Inc. Securities Litigation and appointed the Paysign Investor Group as lead plaintiff. On
January 12, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in the consolidated action. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint
on March 15, 2021. On February 9, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants Motion to Dismiss. On May 22, 2023,
Defendants filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint. On December 15, 2023, the parties agreed in principle to a proposed settlement of
the Securities Class Action and Plaintiffs filed a Consented Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement. On January 4, 2024, the Court
preliminarily approved a settlement in the amount of 3,750,000, the entirety of which came from the Company s directors-and-officers
insurance policy, for the referenced class of purchasers, and scheduled a final approval hearing for April 17, 2024. On April 17, 2024,
the Court conducted the final approval hearing and approved the settlement and, on April 18, 2024, issued an order and final judgment
thereon. 

The Company has also been named as a nominal defendant
in four stockholder derivative actions currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. The first-filed
derivative action is entitled Andrzej Toczek, derivatively on behalf of Paysign, Inc. v. Mark R. Newcomer, et al. and was filed on September
17, 2020. This action alleges violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste,
largely in connection with the failure to correct information technology controls over financial reporting alleged in the Securities Class
Action, thereby causing the Company to face exposure in the Securities Class Action. The complaint also alleges insider trading violations
against certain individual defendants. The second-filed derivative action is entitled John K. Gray, derivatively on behalf of Paysign,
Inc. v. Mark Attinger, et al. and was filed on May 9, 2022. This action involves the same alleged conduct raised in the Toczek action
and asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with financial reporting, breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged
insider trading against certain individual defendants, and unjust enrichment. On June 3, 2022, the Court approved a stipulation staying
the action until the Court in the consolidated Securities Class Action issued a ruling on the Motion to Dismiss. On May 10, 2023, the
Toczek and Gray actions were consolidated. 

The Company has also been named as a nominal defendant
in a third stockholder derivative action initially filed in state court in Clark County, Nevada, on October 2, 2023, entitled Simone Blanchette,
derivatively on behalf of Paysign, Inc. v. Mark Newcomer, et al, which the defendants subsequently removed to federal district court in
Nevada pursuant to a Notice of Removal filed on October 10, 2023. That complaint makes substantially the same allegations as made in the
consolidated Toczek and Gray actions, and also contains a claim that the individual defendants violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder. On December 7, 2023, the parties requested that the action be stayed for sixty days due to the settlement negotiations in
the consolidated Toczek and Gray actions, and the Court granted the sixty-day stay on December 11, 2023. Subsequently, the Court extended
that deadline to March 29, 2024 and then to May 29, 2024 based upon the parties stipulations. 

25 

The Company has also been named as a nominal defendant
in a fourth stockholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, filed on December 27, 2023,
entitled Mo Jeewa, derivatively on behalf of Paysign, Inc. v. Mark R. Newcomer, et al. That complaint makes substantially the same allegations
as made in the consolidated Toczek and Gray actions and the Blanchette action discussed above, and alleges breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment. 

On October 4, 2024, the parties to the four shareholder
derivative actions agreed to a mediator s proposal to settle all four actions. The parties are currently in the process of documenting
that settlement and intend to submit the proposed settlement to the district court for approval pursuant to Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. 

The four shareholder derivative actions settled
by the Company agree to certain corporate therapeutics and the payment of a total of 607,500 in attorneys fees split among counsel
in all four of the existing derivative actions, which will be paid by the Company s insurer.
