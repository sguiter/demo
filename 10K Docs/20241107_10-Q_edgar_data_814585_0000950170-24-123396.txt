FORWARD-LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS This quarterly report of MBIA Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, (collectively, MBIA , the Company , we , us or our includes statements that are not historical or current facts and are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words believe , anticipate , project , plan , expect , estimate , intend , will likely result , looking forward , or will continue and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. MBIA cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only to their respective dates. We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statement if the Company later becomes aware that such result is not likely to be achieved. The following are some of the general factors that could affect financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in or underlying the Company s forward-looking statements: increased credit losses or impairments on public finance obligations that National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation National insures issued by state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities and other providers of public services, located in the U.S. or abroad, that are experiencing fiscal stress; 

 the possibility that loss reserve estimates are not adequate to cover potential claims; 

 a disruption in the cash flow from National or an inability to access the capital markets and our exposure to significant fluctuations in liquidity and asset values in the global credit markets as a result of collateral posting requirements; 

 our ability to fully implement our strategic plan; 

 the possibility that MBIA Insurance Corporation will have inadequate liquidity or resources to timely pay claims as a result of higher than expected losses on certain insured transactions or as a result of a delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries, which could lead the New York State Department of Financial Services NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding under Article 74 of the New York Insurance Law and/or take such other actions as the NYSDFS may deem necessary to protect the interests of MBIA Insurance Corporation s policyholders; 

 deterioration in the economic environment and financial markets in the United States or abroad, real estate market performance, credit spreads, interest rates and foreign currency levels; and 

 the effects of changes to governmental regulation, including insurance laws, securities laws, tax laws, legal precedents and accounting rules. 

 The above factors provide a summary of and are qualified in their entirety by the risk factors discussed under Risk Factors in Part II, Other Information, Item 1A included in Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company encourages readers to review these risk factors in their entirety. This quarterly report of MBIA Inc. also includes statements of the opinion and belief of MBIA management which may be forward-looking statements subject to the preceding cautionary disclosure. Unless otherwise indicated herein, the basis for each statement of opinion or belief of MBIA management in this report is the relevant industry or subject matter experience and views of certain members of MBIA s management. Accordingly, MBIA cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such statements, because like all statements of opinion or belief they are not statements of fact and may prove to be incorrect. We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any statement of opinion or belief if the Company later becomes aware that such statement of opinion or belief was not or is not then accurate. In addition, readers are cautioned that each statement of opinion or belief may be further qualified by disclosures set forth elsewhere in this report or in other disclosures by MBIA.

MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Con solidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) operating segments: 1) United States U.S. public finance insurance; 2) corporate; and 3) international and structured finance insurance. The Company s U.S. public finance insurance business is managed through National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation National ), the corporate segment is operated through MBIA Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, including its service company, MBIA Services Corporation MBIA Services and its international and structured finance insurance business is primarily operated through MBIA Insurance Corporation and its subsidiaries MBIA Corp. ). Refer to Note 9: Business Segments for further information about the Company s operating segments. Business Developments PREPA On January 1, 2024, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority PREPA defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of million. In addition, on July 1, 2024, PREPA defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of million. As of September 30, 2024, National had million of insured debt service outstanding related to PREPA. On January 31, 2023, National entered into a restructuring support agreement PREPA RSA with the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the Oversight Board ), on behalf of itself and as the sole Title III representative of PREPA. A plan of adjustment for PREPA (the "Plan") and related disclosure statement was filed on February 9, 2023. Subsequently, both the Plan and PREPA RSA were amended. The Title III Court conducted confirmation hearings in March 2024. On June 12, 2024, the First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Swain's prior rulings on bondholder liens and claim amounts (the "Appeal Decision"), following which the Oversight Board informed the Court that it intended to file an amendment to the Plan it believed would account for the changes required by the First Circuit opinion. On June 26, 2024, the Oversight Board filed a petition for a First Circuit panel rehearing, and the Unsecured Creditors Committee filed an en banc appeal. Both are currently pending. Following a status conference held on July 10, 2024, the Court imposed a 60-day stay of all litigation and other filings related to the amended Plan, which stay was subsequently extended until January 31, 2025, and ordered the parties into mediation. Following the Appeal Decision, the Oversight Board informed the Court, National and other parties that it intended to modify National s settlement in a forthcoming amended Plan. Thereafter, National provided notice to the Oversight Board that National did not support the board's actions and that such actions constituted a breach and termination of the PREPA RSA, as amended. There is no assurance that a plan that is substantially similar in the treatment of National's claims and rights will ultimately be confirmed and become effective. In the event of a substantially different confirmed plan, National s PREPA loss reserves and recoveries could be materially adversely affected. Refer to Note 5: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves for additional information of the Company s PREPA reserves and recoveries.

Risks and Uncertainties The Company s financial statements include estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The outcome of certain significant risks and uncertainties could cause the Company to revise its estimates and assumptions or could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s estimates. The discussion below highlights the significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements and business objectives in future periods. National s Insured Portfolio National continues to monitor and remediate its existing insured portfolio. Certain state and local governments and territory obligors that National insures are under financial and budgetary stress. This could lead to an increase in defaults by such entities on the payment of their obligations and losses or impairments on a greater number of National s insured transactions. In particular, PREPA is currently in bankruptcy-like proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. There is no assurance that a PREPA plan that is substantially similar in the treatment of National's claims and rights will ultimately be confirmed and become effective. PREPA may continue to fail to make payments when due, which could cause National to make additional claims payments which could be material. Refer to the above Business Developments - PREPA section for additional information.

MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) additional consolidations or deconsolidations of VIEs. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company did t consolidate any additional VIEs and deconsolidated VIE due to the prepayment of outstanding notes and recorded losses of million, of which million was due to credit losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") that were released to earnings. During the third, second and first quarters of 2023, the Company deconsolidated structured finance VIE each quarter due to the commutation of the credit enhancement on or prepayments of the outstanding notes of the VIEs that the Company insured and recorded losses of million, million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, additional VIEs were consolidated. Consolidation and deconsolidation gains and losses, if any, are recorded within Other net realized gains (losses) under Revenues of consolidated variable interest entities on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Holders of insured obligations of issuer-sponsored VIEs do not have recourse to the general assets of the Company. In the event of nonpayment of an insured obligation issued by a consolidated VIE, the Company is obligated to pay principal and interest, when due, on the respective insured obligation only. The Company s exposure to consolidated VIEs is limited to the credit protection provided on insured obligations and any additional variable interests held by the Company.

 Changes in Loss and LAE Reserves Loss and LAE reserves represent the Company s estimate of future claims and LAE payments, net of any future recoveries of such payments. The following table presents changes in the Company s loss and LAE reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in loss and LAE reserves, with the exception of loss and LAE payments, are recorded in Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.

() 

() 

(1) - 
 The increase in the Company s loss and LAE reserves was primarily due to assumption changes for National's PREPA reserves, partially offset by the January and July of 2024 claim payments on PREPA. Refer to Note 1: Business Developments and Risks and Uncertainties for further information on PREPA. In addition, National established reserves on a U.S. Public Finance lease-backed transaction. Changes in Insurance Loss Recoverable Insurance loss recoverable represents the Company s estimate of expected recoveries on paid claims and LAE.

 Sensitivity of Significant Unobservable Inputs The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s equity investments at fair value are the discount rate, EBITDA multiple and EBITDA royalty share. The fair value of equity investments is determined as the mid-point of a range of valuation scenarios. If there had been lower or higher EBITDA multiple or EBITDA royalty share, the value of equity investments would have been lower or higher, respectively. If there had been a lower or higher discount rate, the value of equity investments would have been higher or lower, respectively. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s equity investments at fair value were the EBITDA multiples, discount rate, hard asset values and type certificate values. The fair value of equity investments was determined by taking a weighted average of valuation scenarios. If there had been lower or higher EBITDA multiples, hard asset values or type certificate values, the value of equity investments would have been lower or higher, respectively. If there had been a lower or higher discount rate, the value of equity investments would have been higher or lower, respectively. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the loans carried at fair value is the discount rate. The loans carried at fair value is determined by discounting cash flows. The discount rate includes the credit spread which primarily reflects the credit quality of the obligor. If there had been a lower or higher discount rate, the value of loans carried at fair value would have been higher or lower, respectively. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s residential loans receivable at fair value of consolidated VIEs is the impact of the financial guarantee. The fair value of residential loans receivable is calculated by subtracting the value of the financial guarantee from the market value of similar instruments to that of the VIE liabilities. The value of a financial guarantee is estimated by the Company as the present value of expected cash payments, net of recoveries, under the policy. If there had been a lower expected cash flow on the underlying loans receivable of the VIE, the value of the financial guarantee provided by the Company under the insurance policy would have been higher. This would have resulted in a lower fair value of the residential loans receivable in relation to the obligations of the VIE. As of December 31, 2023, the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s VIE notes of consolidated VIEs was the impact of the financial guarantee. The fair value of VIE notes was calculated by adding the value of the financial guarantee to the market value of VIE assets. When the VIE note is backed by RMBS, the fair value of the VIE liability is calculated by applying the market value of similar instruments to that of the VIE liabilities. The value of a financial guarantee was estimated by the Company as the present value of expected cash payments under the policy. If the value of the guarantee provided by the Company to the obligations issued by the VIE had increased, the credit support would have added value to the liabilities of the VIE. This would have resulted in an increased fair value of the liabilities of the VIE.

Medium-term notes 

The differences between the contractual outstanding principal and the fair values on loans receivable, VIE notes and MTNs in the preceding table are primarily attributable to credit risk. This is due to the high rate of defaults on loans (90 days or more past due), the collateral supporting the VIE notes and the nonperformance risk of the Company on its MTNs, all of which resulted in depressed pricing of the financial instruments. Instrument-Specific Credit Risk of Liabilities Elected Under the Fair Value Option As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the cumulative changes in instrument-specific credit risk of liabilities elected under the fair value option were gains of million and losses of million, respectively, reported in AOCI on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from changes in the Company s credit spread. For liabilities of VIEs, additional adjustments to instrument-specific credit risk are required, which is determined by an analysis of deal specific performance of collateral that support these liabilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , the portions of instrument-specific credit risk included in AOCI that were recognized in earnings due to settlement of liabilities were losses of million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the portions of instrument-specific credit risk included in AOCI that were recognized in earnings due to settlement of liabilities were losses of million and million, respectively.

million and reported in "Other net realized gains (losses)" on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Credit Losses on Investments The Company s fixed-maturity securities for which fair value is less than amortized cost are reviewed quarterly in order to determine whether a credit loss exists. If the Company determines that the declines in the fair value are related to credit loss, the Company will establish an allowance for credit losses and recognize the credit component through earnings. Refer to Note 8: Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of the Company s policy for its determination of credit losses. The Company did not purchase any credit-deteriorated assets or establish an allowance for credit losses for AFS securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not recognize credit losses on securities insured by MBIA Corp. and National since those securities, whether or not owned by the Company, are evaluated for impairments in accordance with its loss reserving policy.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes 

Effective tax rate 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s effective tax rate applied to its loss from continuing operations before income taxes was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due to the full valuation allowance on the changes in its net deferred tax asset. Deferred Tax Asset, Net of Valuation Allowance The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of its existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the Company having a three-year cumulative loss. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company s projections of pre-tax income. On the basis of this evaluation, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company will continue to analyze the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Net operating losses NOLs of property and casualty insurance companies are permitted to be carried back two years and carried forward 20 years. NOLs of property and casualty insurance companies are not subject to the 80 percent taxable income limitation and indefinite lived carryforward period required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act applicable to general corporate NOLs. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes The Company s policy is to record and disclose any change in unrecognized tax benefit UTB and related interest and/or penalties to income tax in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company includes interest as a component of income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had material UTB. Federal income tax returns through 2011 have been examined or surveyed. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company s NOL is approximately billion. NOLs generated prior to tax reform and property and casualty NOLs generated after tax reform will expire between tax years 2026 through 2044. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has a foreign tax credit carryforward of million, which will expire between tax years 2024 through 2033. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code Included in the Company s Amended By-Laws are restrictions on certain acquisitions of Company stock that otherwise may have increased the likelihood of an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. With certain exceptions, the By-Laws generally prohibit a person from becoming a Section 382 five-percent shareholder by acquiring, directly or by attribution, 5 or more of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock.

MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) operating segments: 1) U.S. public finance insurance; 2) corporate; and 3) international and structured finance insurance. The Company s U.S. public finance insurance business is operated through National and its international and structured finance insurance business is operated through MBIA Corp. The following sections provide a description of each of the Company s reportable operating segments. U.S. Public Finance Insurance The Company s U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National. The financial guarantees issued by National provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, U.S. public finance insured obligations when due. The obligations are not subject to acceleration, except that National may have the right, at its discretion, to accelerate insured obligations upon default or otherwise. National s guarantees insure municipal bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable indebtedness of U.S. political subdivisions, as well as utilities, airports, health care institutions, higher educational facilities, housing authorities and other similar agencies and obligations issued by private entities that finance projects that serve a substantial public purpose. Municipal bonds and privately issued bonds used for the financing of public purpose projects are generally supported by taxes, assessments, fees or tariffs related to the use of these projects, lease payments or other similar types of revenue streams. Corporate The Company s corporate segment consists of general corporate activities, including providing support services to MBIA Inc. s subsidiaries as well as asset and capital management. Support services are provided by the Company s service company, MBIA Services, and include, among others, management, legal, accounting, treasury, information technology, and insurance portfolio surveillance, on a fee-for-service basis. MBIA Services is compensated for services at cost and its net revenues and expenses are generally managed to break-even. Capital management includes activities related to servicing obligations issued by MBIA Inc. and its subsidiary, MBIA Global Funding, LLC GFL ). MBIA Inc. issued debt to finance the operations of the MBIA group. GFL raised funds through the issuance of MTNs with varying maturities, which were in turn guaranteed by MBIA Corp. GFL lent the proceeds of these MTN issuances to MBIA Inc. MBIA Inc. also provided customized investment agreements, guaranteed by MBIA Corp., for bond proceeds and other public funds for such purposes as construction, loan origination, escrow and debt service or other reserve fund requirements. The Company has ceased issuing new MTNs and investment agreements and the outstanding liability balances and corresponding asset balances have declined over time as liabilities matured, terminated or were called or repurchased. All of the debt within the corporate segment is managed collectively and is serviced by available liquidity. International and Structured Finance Insurance The Company s international and structured finance insurance segment is principally conducted through MBIA Corp. The financial guarantees issued by MBIA Corp. generally provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, non-U.S. public finance and global structured finance insured obligations when due, or in the event MBIA Corp. has the right, at its discretion, to accelerate insured obligations upon default or otherwise. MBIA Corp. insures non-U.S. public finance and global structured finance obligations, including asset-backed obligations. MBIA Corp. has insured sovereign-related and sub- sovereign bonds, utilities, privately issued bonds used for the financing of projects that include toll roads, bridges, public transportation facilities, and other types of infrastructure projects serving a substantial public purpose. MBIA Corp. also insures structured finance and asset-backed obligations repayable from expected cash flows generated by a specified pool of assets, such as residential and commercial mortgages, consumer loans and structured settlements. MBIA Corp. insures the investment contracts written by MBIA Inc., and if MBIA Inc. were to have insufficient assets to pay amounts due upon maturity or termination, MBIA Corp. would make such payments. MBIA Insurance Corporation also insures debt obligations of GFL. MBIA Corp. has also written policies guaranteeing obligations under certain derivative contracts, including termination payments that may become due upon certain insolvency or payment defaults of the financial guarantor or the issuer. MBIA Corp. has not written any meaningful amount of business since 2008.

MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) material legal proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party. Lease Commitments The Company has a lease agreement for its headquarters in Purchase, New York. The initial lease term expires in 2030 with the option to terminate the lease in 2025 upon the payment of a termination amount. This lease agreement included an incentive amount to fund certain leasehold improvements, renewal options, escalation clauses and a free rent period. This lease agreement has been classified as an operating lease, and operating rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. In May of 2024, the Company notified its landlord of the Purchase, New York lease that it is exercising its right to terminate the lease in August of 2025 ("Termination Date"). In connection with this termination notice, the Company will pay a termination fee that includes the unamortized amount of incentives, free rent and other costs at the Termination Date. The Company accounted for this termination as a lease modification and remeasured its lease liability to the present value of the remaining lease payments and adjusted its right-of-use ("ROU") asset as of the modification date in accordance with ASC 842. This resulted in a decrease of the Company's ROU asset and lease liability of million and did not have a material impact to lease expense recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of MBIA Inc. should be read in conjunction with the other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q. In addition, this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes statements of the opinion of MBIA Inc. s management which may be forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. Refer to Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A and Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of MBIA Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties. OVERVIEW MBIA Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, (collectively, MBIA , the Company , we , us , or our operates within the financial guarantee insurance industry. MBIA manages its business within three operating segments: 1) United States U.S. public finance insurance; 2) corporate; and 3) international and structured finance insurance. Our U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation National ), our corporate segment is managed through MBIA Inc. and several of its subsidiaries, including our service company, MBIA Services Corporation MBIA Services ), and our international and structured finance insurance business is primarily managed through MBIA Insurance Corporation and its subsidiaries MBIA Corp. ). National s primary objectives are to maximize the performance of its existing insured portfolio through effective surveillance and remediation activity and effectively manage its investment portfolio. Our corporate segment consists of general corporate activities, including providing support services to MBIA s operating subsidiaries and asset and capital management. MBIA Corp. s primary objectives are to satisfy all claims by its policyholders and to maximize future recoveries, if any, for its surplus note holders, and then its preferred stock holders. MBIA Corp. is executing this strategy by, among other things, taking steps to maximize the collection of recoveries and reducing and mitigating potential losses on its insurance exposures. We do not expect National or MBIA Corp. to write new financial guarantee policies outside of remediation related activities. Economic Environment U.S. economic activity indicators have continued to expand at a solid pace with slowing job gains and a low unemployment rate. Inflation remains elevated. With the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC seeking to achieve maximum employment and 2 inflation over the longer run, at the September of 2024 meeting, the FOMC lowered its federal funds rate target range by 50 basis points to 4.75 to 5.00 . Economic and financial market trends could impact the Company s financial results. Economic improvement at the state and local level strengthens the credit quality of the issuers of our insured municipal bonds, improves the performance of our insured U.S. public finance portfolio and could reduce the amount of National s potential incurred losses. Higher interest rates could adversely affect the values of our Company s investment portfolio, but increase investment portfolio yield and income, and decrease the present value of loss reserves. 2024 Business Developments The following is a summary of 2024 business developments: PREPA On January 1, 2024, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority PREPA defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of 16 million. In addition, on July 1, 2024, PREPA defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of 122 million. As of September 30, 2024, National had 670 million of insured debt service outstanding related to PREPA.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 OVERVIEW (continued) On January 31, 2023, National entered into a restructuring support agreement PREPA RSA with the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the Oversight Board ), on behalf of itself and as the sole Title III representative of PREPA. A plan of adjustment for PREPA (the "Plan") and related disclosure statement was filed on February 9, 2023. Subsequently, both the Plan and PREPA RSA were amended. The Title III Court conducted confirmation hearings in March 2024. On June 12, 2024, the First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Swain's prior rulings on bondholder liens and claim amounts (the "Appeal Decision"), following which the Oversight Board informed the Court that it intended to file an amendment to the Plan it believed would account for the changes required by the First Circuit opinion. On June 26, 2024, the Oversight Board filed a petition for a First Circuit panel rehearing, and the Unsecured Creditors Committee ("UCC") filed an en banc appeal. Both are currently pending. Following a status conference held on July 10, 2024, the Court imposed a 60-day stay of all litigation and other filings related to the amended Plan, which stay was subsequently extended until January 31, 2025, and ordered the parties into mediation. Following the Appeal Decision, the Oversight Board informed the Court, National and other parties that it intended to modify National s settlement in a forthcoming amended Plan. Thereafter, National provided notice to the Oversight Board that National did not support the board's actions and that such actions constituted a breach and termination of the PREPA RSA, as amended. There is no assurance that a plan that is substantially similar in the treatment of National's claims and rights will ultimately be confirmed and become effective. In the event of a substantially different confirmed plan, National s PREPA loss reserves and recoveries could be materially adversely affected. 

 Refer to the following U.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures section for additional information on our PREPA exposure.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Income (loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The increase in consolidated total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was principally due to favorable changes in revenues from consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") and net realized investment losses. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes from our interest rate swaps and by unfavorable changes from movements in foreign exchange rates. The three months ended September 30, 2023 included 30 million of consolidated VIE losses primarily from the reclassification of credit risk losses from AOCI to net income (loss) due to early redemptions of VIE liabilities and a loss from the deconsolidation of a VIE compared with a gain of 1 million for the same period of 2024. The three months ended September 30, 2023 also included 13 million of net realized investment losses from the sales of investments with no comparable losses in 2024. The three months ended September 30, 2023 included fair value net gains on our interest rate swaps of 20 million with no comparable amounts for the same period of 2024. This variance was primarily due to the termination of substantially all of the interest rates swaps in 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2024 included foreign currency losses of 4 million on euro-denominated liabilities compared with foreign currency gains of 4 million on these liabilities for the same period of 2023. This unfavorable change was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro in 2024 compared with the U.S. dollar strengthening against the euro in 2023. Consolidated total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 11 million of losses and loss adjustment expense LAE compared with 123 million for the same period of 2023. This decrease in losses and LAE was primarily due to changes in PREPA net reserves. Refer to the following Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses sections of the U.S. Public Finance Insurance and International and Structured Finance Insurance segments for additional information on our losses and LAE.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Income (loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The decrease in consolidated total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was principally due to unfavorable changes from fair valuing investments, net investment income and our interest rate swaps. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by favorable changes from revenues from consolidated VIEs and net realized investment losses from sales of investments. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 56 million of losses from fair valuing investments compared with 4 million of gains for the same period of 2023. Net investment income decreased 24 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 primarily due to a lower average asset base as a result of the extraordinary cash dividend payment on MBIA Inc.'s stock in December of 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included fair value net gains on our interest rate swaps of 22 million with no comparable amounts for the same period of 2024. This variance was primarily due to the termination of substantially all of the interest rates swaps in 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 37 million and 72 million, respectively, of consolidated VIE losses primarily from the reclassification of credit risk losses from AOCI to net income (loss) due to early redemptions of VIE liabilities and losses from the deconsolidation of VIEs. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 3 million and 23 million, respectively, of net realized investment losses from sales of investments Consolidated total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 171 million of losses and LAE compared with 158 million for the same period of 2023, primarily related to PREPA. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included an incurred loss from accretion compared with an incurred benefit from the impact of changes in risk-free interest rates on the present value of loss reserves for the same period of 2023 on our insured residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") exposure. Refer to the following Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses sections of the U.S. Public Finance Insurance and International and Structured Finance Insurance segments for additional information on our losses and LAE. Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Provision for Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our effective tax rate applied to our loss before income taxes was below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 due to the full valuation allowance on the changes in our net deferred tax asset, which included our net operating loss NOL ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset was 1.3 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. Notwithstanding the full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset, the Company believes that it may be able to use some of its net deferred tax asset before the expirations associated with that asset based upon expected earnings at National. Accordingly, the Company will continue to re-evaluate its net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that the Company will reverse any of its valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset in the future. Refer to Note 8: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes, including the valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax asset and its accounting for tax uncertainties. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes Pursuant to a plan of liquidation that became effective in August of 2022, MBIA Corp.'s interest in the remaining collateral of the Zohar collateralized debt obligation CDO 2003-1, Limited Zohar I and Zohar II 2005-1, Limited Zohar II (collectively, the "Zohar CDOs") was distributed to MBIA Corp. either directly or in the form of interests in certain asset recovery entities. The interests in the asset recovery entities include various loans to and equity interest in portfolio companies. The Company classifies certain of these portfolio companies as discontinued operations. Included in this amount are the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 1: Business Developments and Risks and Uncertainties in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income (Loss) In addition to our results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), we also analyze the operating performance of the Company using adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, both non-GAAP measures. Since adjusted net income (loss) is used by management to assess performance and make business decisions, we consider adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share fundamental measures of periodic financial performance which are useful in understanding our results. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share are not substitutes for net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted common share determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definitions of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share may differ from those used by other companies. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share include the after-tax results of the Company and remove the after-tax results of our international and structured finance insurance segment, comprising the results of MBIA Corp. and its discontinued operations net of noncontrolling interest and income taxes, which given MBIA Corp. s capital structure and business prospects, we do not expect its financial performance to have a material economic impact on MBIA Inc., as well as adjusting the following: Mark-to-market gains (losses) on financial instruments We remove the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses) on financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, investment securities and hybrid financial instruments. These amounts fluctuate based on market interest rates, credit spreads and other market factors. 

 Foreign exchange gains (losses) We remove foreign exchange gains (losses) on the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities and transactions in non-functional currencies. Given the possibility of volatility in foreign exchange markets, we exclude the impact of foreign exchange gains (losses) to provide a measurement of comparability of adjusted net income (loss). 

 Net realized investment gains (losses), impaired securities and extinguishments of debt We remove realized gains (losses) on the sale of investments, net investment losses related to impairment of securities and net gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt since the timing of these transactions are subject to management s assessment of market opportunities and conditions and capital liquidity positions. 

 Income taxes We apply a zero effective tax rate for federal income tax purposes to our pre-tax adjustments, if applicable, consistent with our consolidated effective tax rate.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Book Value Adjustments Per Share In addition to GAAP book value per share, for internal purposes management also analyzes adjusted book value ABV per share, changes to which we view as an important indicator of financial performance. ABV is also used by management in certain components of management s compensation. Since many of the Company s investors and analysts continue to use ABV to evaluate MBIA s share price and as the basis for their investment decisions, we present GAAP book value per share as well as the individual adjustments used by management to calculate its internal ABV metric.g Management adjusts GAAP book value to remove the book value of MBIA Corp., its discontinued operations, and for certain items which the Company believes will reverse from GAAP book value through GAAP earnings and comprehensive income, as well as add in the impact of certain items which the Company believes will be realized in GAAP book value in future periods. The Company has limited such adjustments to those items that it deems to be important to fundamental value and performance and for which the likelihood and amount can be reasonably estimated. The following provides a description of management s adjustments to GAAP book value: Negative Book value of MBIA Corp. We remove the negative book value of MBIA Corp., including its discontinued operations based on our view that given MBIA Corp. s current financial condition, the regulatory regime in which it operates, the priority given to its policyholders, surplus note holders and preferred stock holders with respect to the distribution of assets, and its legal structure, it is not and will not likely be in a position to upstream any economic benefit to MBIA Inc. Further, MBIA Inc. does not face any material financial liability arising from MBIA Corp. 

 Net unrealized (gains) losses on available-for-sale AFS securities excluding MBIA Corp. We remove net unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income since they will reverse from GAAP book value when such securities mature. Gains and losses from sales and impairments of AFS securities are recorded in book value through earnings. 

 Net unearned premium revenue in excess of expected losses of National - We include net unearned premium revenue in excess of expected losses. Net unearned premium revenue in excess of expected losses consists of the financial guarantee unearned premium revenue of National in excess of expected insurance losses, net of reinsurance and deferred acquisition costs. In accordance with GAAP, a loss reserve on a financial guarantee policy is only recorded when expected losses exceed the amount of unearned premium revenue recorded for that policy. As a result, we only add to GAAP book value the amount of unearned premium revenue in excess of expected losses for each policy in order to reflect the full amount of our expected losses. The Company s net unearned premium revenue will be recognized in GAAP book value in future periods, however, actual amounts could differ from estimated amounts due to such factors as credit defaults and policy terminations, among others. 

 Since the Company has a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset and a zero consolidated effective tax rate, the book value per share adjustments reflect a zero effective tax rate. The following table provides the Company s GAAP book value per share and management s adjustments to book value per share used in our internal analysis:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) U.S. Public Finance Insurance Segment Our U.S. public finance insurance portfolio is managed through National. The financial guarantees issued by National provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured obligations when due or, in the event National has exercised, at its discretion, the right to accelerate the payment under its policies upon the acceleration of the underlying insured obligations due to default or otherwise. National s guarantees insure municipal bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable indebtedness of U.S. political subdivisions, as well as utility districts, airports, healthcare institutions, higher educational facilities, housing authorities and other similar agencies and obligations issued by private entities that finance projects that serve a substantial public purpose. Municipal bonds and privately issued bonds used for the financing of public purpose projects are generally supported by taxes, assessments, user fees or tariffs related to the use of these projects, lease payments or other similar types of revenue streams. As of September 30, 2024, National had total insured gross par outstanding of 25.9 billion. National continues to monitor and remediate its existing insured portfolio and has pursued and may continue to pursue other transactions that could enhance shareholder value. Regarding its insured portfolio, some state and local governments and territory obligors that National insures are experiencing financial and budgetary stress which could lead to an increase in defaults by such entities on the payment of their obligations and, while such stress has not yet occurred materially, losses or impairments on a greater number of the Company s insured transactions. In particular, PREPA had been experiencing significant fiscal stress and constrained liquidity. Refer to the U.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures section for additional information on our PREPA exposures. We continue to monitor and analyze these situations and other stressed credits closely, and the overall extent and duration of stress affecting our insured credits remains uncertain.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NET PREMIUMS EARNED Net premiums earned on financial guarantees represent gross premiums earned net of premiums ceded to reinsurers, and include scheduled premium earnings and premium earnings from refunded issues. Refunding activity over the past several years has accelerated premium earnings in prior years and reduced the amount of scheduled premiums that would have been earned in the current year. Refunding activity can vary significantly from period to period based on issuer refinancing behavior. Included in net premiums earned for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were scheduled premiums earned of 7 million and 6 million, respectively. Included in net premiums earned for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were scheduled premiums earned of 20 million and 21 million, respectively. NET INVESTMENT INCOME The decrease in net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023 were primarily due to a lower average invested asset base as a result of the dividend payments to National's ultimate parent, MBIA Inc., in 2023. This decrease was partially offset by higher yields on investments. NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) The net realized investment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to sales of securities from the ongoing management of our U.S. public finance investment portfolio, including to generate liquidity to pay claims. OTHER NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) The other net realized losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to impairments of certain investments that were in an unrealized loss position and which we intended to sell before their values recovered to their amortized cost basis. LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES Our U.S. public finance insured portfolio management group is responsible for monitoring our U.S. public finance segment s insured obligations. The level and frequency of monitoring of any insured obligation depends on the type, size, rating and our assessed performance of the insured issue. Refer to Note 5: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company s insurance loss recoverables and loss and LAE reserves. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, losses and LAE activity was primarily due to accretion partially offset by a decline in risk-free rates, which caused future liabilities, net of recoveries to increase related to our PREPA exposure. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, losses and LAE incurred primarily related to changes in PREPA reserves as a result of current developments in the PREPA remediation. Refer to the following U.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures section for additional information on our PREPA exposures. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 incurred loss included reserves on a U.S. public finance lease-backed transaction. For three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, losses and LAE incurred related to updating PREPA scenarios to reflect the Amended PSA, which included extending the effective date of a settlement until 2024. The following table presents information about our U.S. public finance insurance loss recoverable asset and loss and LAE reserves liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Gross expenses represent total insurance expenses before the deferral of any policy acquisition costs. When an insured obligation refunds, we accelerate to expense any remaining deferred acquisition costs associated with the policy covering the refunded insured obligation. We did not defer a material amount of policy acquisition costs during 2024 or 2023 as we did not write any new insurance business in those years. INSURED PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE Financial guarantee insurance companies use a variety of approaches to assess the underlying credit risk profile of their insured portfolios. National uses both an internally developed credit rating system as well as third-party rating sources in the analysis of credit quality measures of its insured portfolio. In evaluating credit risk, we obtain, when available, the underlying rating(s) of the insured obligation before the benefit of National s insurance policy from nationally recognized rating agencies, Moody s Investor Services Moody s and Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC S P ). Other companies within the financial guarantee industry may report credit quality information based upon internal ratings that would not be comparable to our presentation. We maintain internal ratings on our entire portfolio, and our ratings may be higher or lower than the underlying ratings assigned by Moody s or S P. The following table presents the credit quality distribution of National s U.S. public finance outstanding gross par insured as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Capital appreciation bonds are reported at the par amount at the time of issuance of the insurance policy. All ratings are as of the period presented and represent S P underlying ratings, where available. If transactions are not rated by S P, a Moody s equivalent rating is used. If transactions are not rated by either S P or Moody s, an internal equivalent rating is used.

U.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board certified and filed a petition under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act for Puerto Rico with the District Court of Puerto Rico thereby commencing a bankruptcy-like case for the Puerto Rico Commonwealth GO ("GO"). Under separate petitions, the Oversight Board subsequently commenced Title III proceedings for the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation COFINA ), Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority ("HTA"), PREPA and the Public Buildings Authority PBA on May 5, 2017, May 21, 2017, July 2, 2017 and September 27, 2019, respectively. On February 4, 2019, the District of Puerto Rico entered the order confirming the Third Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment for COFINA. The Title III cases for GO and PBA were confirmed on January 18, 2022, and became effective on March 15, 2022. The confirmation hearing for the HTA Title III case was completed on August 17, 2022, and the confirmation order was entered on October 12, 2022, which became effective on December 6, 2022.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) As a result of prior defaults, various stays and the Title III cases, Puerto Rico failed to make certain scheduled debt service payments for National insured bonds. As a consequence, National has paid gross claims in the aggregate amount of 3.1 billion relating to GO, PBA, PREPA and HTA bonds through September 30, 2024, inclusive of the commutation payment and the additional payment in the amount of 66 million in 2019 related to COFINA and the GO and HTA acceleration and commutation payments of 277 million and 556 million, respectively, in 2022. Status of Puerto Rico s Fiscal Plans On June 23, 2023, the Oversight Board filed a fiscal plan for PREPA for FY2023, which provided for approximately 2.4 billion of distributions to PREPA bondholders. The University of Puerto Rico (the "University") is not a debtor in Title III and continues to be current on its debt service payment. However, the University is subject to a standstill agreement with its senior bondholders, which has been extended to November 30, 2024. National is not a party to the standstill agreement. As of September 30, 2024, National had 62 million of insured debt service outstanding related to the University. PREPA National s largest remaining exposure to Puerto Rico, by gross par outstanding, is to PREPA. On January 31, 2023, National entered into the PREPA RSA with the Oversight Board, on behalf of itself and as the sole Title III representative of PREPA. The Plan and related disclosure statement was filed on February 9, 2023. Subsequently, both the Plan and PREPA RSA were amended. The Title III Court conducted confirmation hearings in March 2024. On June 12, 2024, following the Appeal Decision, the Oversight Board informed the Court that it intended to file an amendment to the Plan it believed would account for the changes required by the First Circuit opinion. On June 26, 2024, the Oversight Board filed a petition for a First Circuit panel rehearing, and the UCC filed an en banc appeal. Both are currently pending. Following a status conference held on July 10, 2024, the Court imposed a 60-day stay of all litigation and other filings related to the amended Plan, which stay was subsequently extended until January 31, 2025, and ordered the parties into mediation. Following the Appeal Decision, the Oversight Board informed the Court, National and other parties that it intended to modify National s settlement in a forthcoming amended Plan. Thereafter, National provided notice to the Oversight Board that National did not support the board's actions and that such actions constituted a breach and termination of the PREPA RSA, as amended. On June 22, 2020, the Oversight Board and the Puerto Rico P3 Authority announced an agreement and contract with LUMA Energy, LLC LUMA which calls for LUMA to take full responsibility for the operation and maintenance of PREPA s transmission and distribution system; the contract runs for 15-years following a transition period expected to take 12 months. PREPA retains ownership of the system as well as responsibility for the power generation system. LUMA assumed responsibility for operations on June 1, 2021. On September 18, 2020, FEMA and the PR COR3 Authority announced the commitment by FEMA to provide approximately 11.6 billion (net of the required 10 cost share) to fund projects built by PREPA and the PR Department of Education; approximately 9.4 billion (net) of this amount is designated for PREPA. LUMA is now involved in the planning of the related projects as well as proceedings related thereto in front the PR Energy Bureau as well as PR-COR3. On January 25, 2023, the Oversight Board and Puerto Rico P3 Authority announced an agreement and contract with Genera PR LLC Genera which calls for Genera to take full responsibility of the operation and maintenance of the existing power generation assets owned by PREPA; the contract will run for 10-years following a transition period. PREPA retains ownership of the assets. The following table presents our scheduled gross debt service due on our PREPA insured exposures as of September 30, 2024, for the three months ending December 31, 2024, for each of the subsequent four years ending December 31, and thereafter:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Corporate Segment Our corporate segment consists of general corporate activities, including providing support services to MBIA Inc. s subsidiaries and asset and capital management. Support services are provided by our service company, MBIA Services, and include, among others, management, legal, accounting, treasury, information technology, and insurance portfolio surveillance, on a fee-for-service basis. Capital management includes activities related to servicing obligations issued by MBIA Inc. and its subsidiary, MBIA Global Funding, LLC GFL ). MBIA Inc. issued debt to finance the operations of the MBIA group. GFL raised funds through the issuance of medium-term notes MTNs with varying maturities, which were in turn guaranteed by MBIA Corp. GFL lent the proceeds of these MTN issuances to MBIA Inc. MBIA Inc. provided customized investment agreements, guaranteed by MBIA Corp., for bond proceeds and other public funds for such purposes as construction, loan origination, escrow and debt service or other reserve fund requirements. The Company ceased issuing new MTNs and investment agreements and the outstanding liability balances and corresponding asset balances have declined over time as liabilities matured, terminated, were called or repurchased. All of the debt within the corporate segment is managed collectively and is serviced by available liquidity. The following table summarizes the consolidated results of our corporate segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) The net realized investment losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to sales of securities that supported the terminated interest rate swaps. NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE Net gains (losses) on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange were primarily driven by changes in market values on interest rate swaps and changes in the revaluation of euro-denominated liabilities. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included fair value net gains of 20 million and 22 million, respectively, on interest rate swaps with no comparable material amounts for the same periods of 2024. The 2023 gains were due to an increase in interest rates on swaps that we received floating rates. Substantially all of the interest rates swaps were terminated in the second half of 2023. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2024 included foreign currency losses of 4 million on euro-denominated liabilities compared with foreign currency gains of 5 million on these liabilities for the same period of 2023. This decrease was due to the U.S. dollar weakening against the euro in 2024 compared with the U.S. dollar strengthening against the euro in 2023. International and Structured Finance Insurance Segment Our international and structured finance insurance portfolio is managed through MBIA Corp. The financial guarantees issued by MBIA Corp. generally provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, non-U.S. public finance and global structured finance insured obligations when due or, in the event MBIA Corp. has the right, at its discretion, to accelerate insured obligations upon default or otherwise.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) MBIA Corp. insures sovereign-related and sub- sovereign bonds, utilities, privately issued bonds used for the financing of projects that include toll roads, bridges, public transportation facilities, and other types of infrastructure projects serving a substantial public purpose. MBIA Corp. also insures structured finance and asset-backed obligations repayable from expected cash flows generated by a specified pool of assets, such as residential and commercial mortgages, consumer loans and structured settlements. MBIA Insurance Corporation insures the investment agreements written by MBIA Inc., and if MBIA Inc. were to have insufficient assets to pay amounts due upon maturity or termination, MBIA Insurance Corporation would be required to make such payments under its insurance policies. MBIA Insurance Corporation also insures debt obligations of GFL and obligations under certain types of derivative contracts. As of September 30, 2024, MBIA Corp. s total insured gross par outstanding was 2.5 billion. In addition, MBIA Corp. consolidates insured transactions as VIEs if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, and deconsolidates such VIEs when it is no longer the primary beneficiary. MBIA Corp. has contributed to the Company s NOL carryforward, which is used in the calculation of our consolidated income taxes. If MBIA Corp. becomes profitable, it is not expected to make any tax payments under our tax sharing agreement. Based on MBIA Corp. s current projected earnings and our expectation that it will not write new business outside of remediation activities, we believe it is unlikely that MBIA Corp. will generate significant income in the near future. As a result of MBIA Corp. s capital structure and business prospects, we do not expect its financial performance to have a material economic impact on MBIA Inc.

NET PREMIUMS EARNED Our international and structured finance insurance segment generates net premiums from insurance policies accounted for as financial guarantee contracts. Net premiums earned represent gross premiums earned net of premiums ceded to reinsurers, and include scheduled premium earnings and premium earnings from refunded issues. Certain premiums may be eliminated in our consolidated financial statements as a result of the Company consolidating VIEs. Net premiums earned were primarily non-U.S.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NET INVESTMENT INCOME The decrease in net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was primarily due to the acceleration of accretion to par value upon the redemption of securities that were purchased at a discount in 2023. NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE The net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to fair value losses on investments for which the fair value option was elected. The net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses on the revaluation of non-U.S. dollar insurance balances. REVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIEs The net losses of consolidated VIE revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily driven by recognizing credit risk losses from the early redemptions of VIE liabilities and losses from the deconsolidation of VIEs. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net losses of consolidated VIE revenues included the reclassification of 11 million, 28 million and 45 million, respectively, of credit risk losses from AOCI to net income (loss). In addition, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a loss of 7 million from the deconsolidation of a VIE. LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES Our international and structured finance insured portfolio management group is responsible for monitoring international and structured finance insured obligations. The level and frequency of monitoring of any insured obligation depends on the type, size, rating and our assessed performance of the insured issue. Refer to Note 5: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company s loss reserving policy and additional information related to its insurance loss recoverables and loss and LAE reserves. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, losses incurred primarily related to a decline in risk-free rates which caused future liabilities, net of recoveries to increase and accretion of loss reserves on our insured RMBS transactions. This was partially offset by a decline in the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR"), which decreased floating rate liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the incurred loss primarily related to accretion of our insured RMBS loss reserves. For three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the incurred benefit primarily related to an increase in risk-free rates used to discount loss reserves, which caused the present value of loss reserves, net of recoveries, to decline. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the incurred benefit was partially offset by the termination of a first-lien RMBS insured transaction for which claim payments were higher than previous reserves. As a result of the consolidation of VIEs, losses and LAE excluded a losses and LAE benefit of 0.2 million and losses and LAE of 21 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and excluded losses and LAE of 1 million and a losses and LAE benefit of 31 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as VIE losses and LAE are eliminated in consolidation.

The insurance loss recoverable primarily relates to reimbursement rights arising from the payment of claims on MBIA Corp. s policies insuring certain RMBS transactions. Such payments also entitle MBIA Corp. to exercise certain rights and remedies to seek recovery of its reimbursement entitlements.

Gross expenses represent total insurance expenses before the deferral of any policy acquisition costs. We did not defer a material amount of policy acquisition costs during 2024 or 2023 as no new business was written. Policy acquisition costs in these periods were primarily related to ceding commissions and premium taxes on installment policies written in prior periods. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense relates to MBIA Corp. s surplus notes that are indexed to 3-month SOFR. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company transitioned from the previously indexed 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate to the 3-month SOFR plus 0.26161 . The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 was due to an increase in interest rates. Refer to the following Liquidity and Capital Resources section for more information about MBIA Corp. s surplus notes. International and Structured Finance Insurance Portfolio Exposures Credit Quality The credit quality of our international and structured finance insured portfolio is assessed in the same manner as our U.S. public finance insured portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 23 and 26 , respectively, of our international and structured finance insured portfolio was rated below investment grade, before giving effect to MBIA s guarantees, based on MBIA s internal ratings, which are generally more current than the underlying ratings provided by S P and Moody s for this subset of our insured portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, below investment grade insurance policies primarily include our first-lien RMBS exposures.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Selected Portfolio Exposures MBIA Corp. insures RMBS backed by residential mortgage loans, including first-lien alternative A-paper and subprime mortgage loans directly through RMBS securitizations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MBIA Corp. had 565 million and 596 million, respectively, of first-lien RMBS gross par outstanding. These amounts include the gross par outstanding related to transactions that the Company consolidates under accounting guidance for VIEs and includes international exposure of 37 million and 39 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MBIA Corp. terminated all of its remaining ABS CDO exposure. As of December 31, 2023, MBIA Corp. insured 117 million of ABS CDOs. We may experience considerable incurred losses in certain of these sectors. There can be no assurance that the loss reserves recorded in our financial statements will be sufficient or that we will not experience losses on transactions on which we currently have no loss reserves, in particular if the economy deteriorates. We may seek to purchase, directly or indirectly, obligations guaranteed by MBIA Corp. or seek to commute policies. The amount of insurance exposure reduced, if any, and the nature of any such actions will depend on market conditions, pricing levels from time to time, and other considerations. In some cases, these activities may result in a reduction of loss reserves, but in all cases they are intended to limit our ultimate losses and reduce the future volatility in loss development on the related policies. Our ability to purchase guaranteed obligations and to commute policies will depend on management s assessment of available liquidity. Effective in the first quarter of 2022, MBIA Corp. was granted a permitted practice by the New York State Department of Financial Services NYSDFS related to the purchase of certain MBIA Corp.-insured securities with gross case base loss reserves Remediation Securities ). The Remediation Securities are acquired with the intent to terminate or commute the related insurance policies. MBIA Corp. may elect to sell the Remediation Securities to facilitate a termination or commutation. U.S. Public Finance and International and Structured Finance Reinsurance Reinsurance enables the Company to cede exposure for purposes of syndicating risk. The Company generally retains the right to reassume the business ceded to reinsurers under certain circumstances, including a reinsurer s rating downgrade below specified thresholds. Currently, we do not intend to use reinsurance to decrease the insured exposure in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of insured par outstanding ceded by MBIA to reinsurers under reinsurance agreements was 693 million compared with 782 million as of December 31, 2023. Under National s reinsurance agreement with MBIA Corp., if a reinsurer of MBIA Corp. is unable to pay claims ceded by MBIA Corp. on U.S. public finance exposure, National will assume liability for such ceded claim payments. For a further discussion of the Company s reinsurance, refer to Note 13: Insurance in Force in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity We use a liquidity risk management framework, the primary objective of which is to match liquidity resources to needs. We monitor our cash and liquid asset resources using cash forecasting and stress-scenario testing. Members of MBIA s senior management meet regularly to review liquidity metrics, discuss contingency plans and establish target liquidity levels. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal-entity basis to take into account the legal, regulatory and other limitations on available liquidity resources within the enterprise.

Operating activities Net cash used by operating activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in losses and LAE paid and operating expenses, partially offset by higher net investment income and other proceeds from VIEs in 2023. Investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 primarily due to higher net proceeds from sales of investments in 2023 related to generating liquidity to pay higher claims and stock repurchases in 2023. Financing activities Net cash used by financing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 primarily due to an increase in principal paydowns of GFL MTNs of 52 million, partially offset by a decrease of 31 million related to purchases of treasury stock. Refer to the following Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Resources section for additional information on debt repurchases. Consolidated Investments The following discussion of investments, including references to consolidated investments, excludes investments reported under Assets of consolidated variable interest entities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments of VIEs support the repayment of VIE obligations and are not available to settle obligations of MBIA. Fixed-maturity securities purchased by the Company are generally designated as AFS. Our AFS investments comprise high-quality fixed-income securities and short-term investments. The credit quality distribution of the Company s AFS fixed-maturity investment portfolios, excluding short-term investments, are based on ratings from Moody s and alternate ratings sources, such as S P or the best estimate of the ratings assigned by the Company, have been used for a small percentage of securities that are not rated by Moody s. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average credit quality rating of the Company s AFS fixed-maturity investment portfolio, excluding short-term investments, was Aa and 95 of the investments were investment grade. The fair values of securities in the Company s AFS fixed-maturity investment portfolio are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Decreases in interest rates generally result in increases in the fair values of fixed-maturity securities and increases in interest rates generally result in decreases in the fair values of fixed-maturity securities.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued) Refer to Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 7: Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our accounting policies and investments. Insured Investments MBIA s consolidated investment portfolio includes investments that are insured by various financial guarantee insurers Insured Investments ), including investments insured by National and MBIA Corp. Company-Insured Investments ). When purchasing Insured Investments, the Company s third-party portfolio manager independently assesses the underlying credit quality, structure and liquidity of each investment, in addition to the creditworthiness of the insurer. Insured Investments are diverse by sector, issuer and size of holding. The third-party portfolio manager assigns underlying ratings to Insured Investments without giving effect to financial guarantees based on underlying ratings assigned by Moody s, or S P when a rating is not published by Moody s. When a Moody s or S P underlying rating is not available, the underlying rating is based on the portfolio manager s best estimate of the rating of such investment. If the Company determines that declines in the fair values of third-party Insured Investments are related to credit loss, the Company will establish an allowance for credit losses and recognize the credit component through earnings. As of September 30, 2024, Insured Investments at fair value represented 142 million or 8 of consolidated investments, of which 132 million or 8 of consolidated investments were Company-Insured Investments. As of September 30, 2024, based on the actual or estimated underlying ratings of our consolidated investment portfolio, without giving effect to financial guarantees, the weighted average rating of only the Insured Investments in the investment portfolio would be in the below investment grade range. Without giving effect to the National and MBIA Corp. guarantees of the Company-Insured Investments in the consolidated investment portfolio, as of September 30, 2024, based on actual or estimated underlying ratings, the weighted average rating of the consolidated investment portfolio was in the Aa range. The weighted average rating of only the Company-Insured Investments was in the below investment grade range, and investments rated below investment grade in the Company-Insured Investments were 7 of the total consolidated investment portfolio. National Liquidity The primary sources of cash available to National are: principal and interest receipts on assets held in its investment portfolio, including proceeds from the sale of assets; and 

 recoveries associated with insurance loss payments. 

 The primary uses of cash by National are: loss and LAE payments on insured transactions; 

 payments of dividends; 

 payments of operating expenses, taxes and investment portfolio asset purchases; and 

 funding share repurchases. 

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, National held cash and investments of 1.2 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, of which 75 million was cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments comprised of highly rated commercial paper, money market funds and municipal, U.S. agency and corporate bonds. The insurance policies issued or reinsured by National provide unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of payments of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured obligations when due. In the event of a default in payment of principal, interest or other insured amounts by an issuer, National generally promises to make funds available in the insured amount within one to three business days following notification. In some cases, the amount due can be substantial, particularly if the default occurs on a transaction to which National has a large notional exposure or on a transaction structured with large, bullet-type principal maturities. The U.S. public finance insurance segment s financial guarantee contracts generally cannot be accelerated by a party other than the insurer which helps to mitigate liquidity risk in this segment.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued) As of September 30, 2024, National has a stand-alone NOL carryforward of 586 million. If National becomes profitable, it is not expected to make any tax payments under our tax sharing agreement until it fully utilizes the available stand-alone NOL. Corporate Liquidity The primary sources of cash available to MBIA Inc. are: dividends from National; 

 available cash and liquid assets not subject to collateral posting requirements; 

 principal and interest receipts on assets held in its investment portfolio, including proceeds from the sale of 

 assets; and access to capital markets. 

 The primary uses of cash by MBIA Inc. are: servicing outstanding unsecured corporate debt obligations and MTNs; 

 meeting collateral posting requirements under investment agreements; 

 payments of operating expenses; 

 funding share repurchases and debt buybacks; and 

 payment of dividends to shareholders. 

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the liquidity positions of MBIA Inc. were 326 million and 411 million, respectively, and included cash and cash equivalents and other investments comprised of highly rated commercial paper and U.S. government and asset-backed bonds. Based on our projections of National s and MBIA Corp. s future earnings and losses, we expect that for the foreseeable future National will be the primary source of payments to MBIA Inc. There can be no assurance as to the amount and timing of any future dividends from National. We expect that National will continue to seek approval to pay special dividends to MBIA Inc. in future years. However, there can be no assurance whether or when NYSDFS will approve such requests and, if the NYSDFS does approve such dividends, in what amounts. Refer to the following Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Resources section for additional information on payments of dividends. We do not expect MBIA Inc. to receive dividends from MBIA Corp. Furthermore, any future dividend payments by MBIA Inc. to shareholders are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, the receipt of additional special dividends from National, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Currently, a portion of the cash and securities held by MBIA Inc. is pledged against investment agreement liabilities, the Asset Swap (simultaneous repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement), which limits its ability to raise liquidity through asset sales of these securities. As the market value or rating eligibility of the assets pledged against MBIA Inc. s obligations declines, we are required to pledge additional eligible assets in order to meet minimum required collateral amounts against these liabilities. To mitigate these risks, we seek to maintain cash and liquidity resources that we believe will be sufficient to make all payments due on our obligations and to meet other financial requirements, such as posting collateral. Contingent liquidity resources include sales of invested assets exposed to credit spread stress risk, which may occur at losses, and accessing the capital markets. These actions, if taken, are expected to result in either additional liquidity or reduced exposure to adverse credit spread movements. There can be no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to fully mitigate this risk. MBIA Corp. Liquidity The primary sources of cash available to MBIA Corp. are: recoveries associated with insurance loss payments; 

 installment premiums and fees; and

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued) principal and interest receipts on assets held in its investment portfolio, including the proceeds from the sale of assets. 

 The primary uses of cash by MBIA Corp. are: loss and LAE or commutation payments on insured transactions; and 

 payments of operating expenses. 

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MBIA Corp. held cash and investments of 235 million and 323 million, respectively, of which 27 million and 41 million, respectively, were cash and cash equivalents or liquid investments comprised of money market funds and municipal, U.S. Treasury and corporate bonds that were immediately available to MBIA Insurance Corporation. Insured obligations that require payment of scheduled debt service payments when due or payment in full of the principal insured at maturity could present liquidity risk for MBIA Corp., as any salvage recoveries from such payments could be recovered over an extended period of time after the payment is made. MBIA Corp. is generally required to satisfy claims within one to three business days, and as a result seeks to identify potential claims in advance through our monitoring process. In order to monitor liquidity risk and maintain appropriate liquidity resources, we use the same methodology as we use to monitor credit quality and losses within our insured portfolio, including stress scenarios. Contractual Obligations For a discussion of the Company s contractual obligations, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity - Contractual Obligations in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material changes in contractual obligations since December 31, 2023. Capital Resources The Company manages its capital resources to minimize its cost of capital while maintaining appropriate claims-paying resources CPR for National and MBIA Corp. The Company s capital resources consist of total shareholders equity, total debt issued by MBIA Inc. for general corporate purposes and surplus notes issued by MBIA Corp. In addition to scheduled debt maturities, from time to time, we reduce unsecured debt through calls or repurchases. Also, MBIA Inc. may repurchase or National may purchase outstanding MBIA Inc. common shares when we deem it beneficial to our shareholders. Purchases or repurchases of debt and common stock may be made from time to time in the open market or in private transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. We may also choose to redeem debt obligations where permitted by the relevant agreements. MBIA Inc. or National may acquire or redeem outstanding common shares of MBIA Inc. and outstanding debt obligations at prices when we deem it beneficial to our shareholders. We seek to maintain sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet the Company s general corporate needs and debt service. Based on MBIA Inc. s debt service requirements and expected operating expenses, we expect that MBIA Inc. will have sufficient resources to satisfy its debt obligations and its general corporate needs over time from distributions from National; however, there can be no assurance that MBIA Inc. will have sufficient resources to do so. In addition, the Company may also consider raising third-party capital. Refer to Capital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Corporate Liquidity section included herein for additional information about MBIA Inc. s liquidity. Debt securities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 63 million par value outstanding of GFL MTNs with maturities in 2024 and 2025 issued by our corporate segment at a discount. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MBIA Inc. repurchased 16 million principal amount of its Debentures.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued) Insurance Statutory Capital National and MBIA Insurance Corporation are incorporated and licensed in, and are subject to primary insurance regulation and supervision by the NYSDFS. MBIA Mexico is regulated by the Comisi n Nacional de Seguros y Fianzas in Mexico. National and MBIA Insurance Corporation each are required to file detailed annual financial statements, as well as interim financial statements, with the NYSDFS and similar supervisory agencies in each of the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed. These financial statements are prepared in accordance with New York State and with statutory accounting principles ("U.S. STAT") and assist our regulators in evaluating minimum standards of solvency, including minimum capital requirements, and business conduct. National Statutory Capital and Surplus National had statutory capital of 1.0 billion and 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, National s policyholders' surplus was 687 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, National had a statutory net loss of 123 million. Refer to the National Claims - Paying Resources (Statutory Basis) section below for additional information on National s statutory capital. In order to maintain its New York State financial guarantee insurance license, National is required to maintain a minimum of 65 million of policyholders surplus. National is also required to maintain contingency reserves to provide protection to policyholders in the event of extreme losses in adverse economic events. As of September 30, 2024, National was in compliance with its aggregate risk limits under New York Insurance Law NYIL ), but was not in compliance with certain of its single risk limits. Since National does not comply with certain of its single risk limits, the NYSDFS could prevent National from transacting any new financial guarantee insurance business. NYIL regulates the payment of dividends by financial guarantee insurance companies and provides that such companies may not declare or distribute dividends except out of statutory earned surplus. National had positive earned surplus as of September 30, 2024 from which it may pay dividends, subject to limitations. Under NYIL, the sum of (i) the amount of dividends declared or distributed during the preceding 12-month period and (ii) the dividend to be declared may not exceed the lesser of (a) 10 of policyholders surplus, as reported in the latest statutory financial statements or (b) 100 of adjusted net investment income for such 12-month period (the net investment income for such 12-month period plus the excess, if any, of net investment income over dividends declared or distributed during the two-year period preceding such 12-month period), unless the Superintendent of the NYSDFS approves a greater dividend distribution based upon a finding that the insurer will retain sufficient surplus to support its obligations. National Claims-Paying Resources (Statutory Basis) CPR is a key measure of the resources available to National to pay claims under its insurance policies. CPR consists of total financial resources and reserves calculated on a statutory basis. CPR has been a common measure used by financial guarantee insurance companies to report and compare resources and continues to be used by MBIA s management to evaluate changes in such resources. We have provided CPR to allow investors and analysts to evaluate National using the same measure that MBIA s management uses to evaluate National s resources to pay claims under its insurance policies. There is no directly comparable GAAP measure. Our calculation of CPR may differ from the calculation of CPR reported by other companies.

MBIA Insurance Corporation Statutory Capital and Surplus MBIA Insurance Corporation had statutory capital of 87 million as of September 30, 2024 compared with 152 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, MBIA Insurance Corporation s negative unassigned surplus was 1.9 billion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MBIA Insurance Corporation had a statutory net loss of 68 million. Refer to the MBIA Insurance Corporation Claims - Paying Resources (Statutory Basis) section below for additional information on MBIA Insurance Corporation s statutory capital. In order to maintain its New York State financial guarantee insurance license, MBIA Insurance Corporation is required to maintain a minimum of 65 million of policyholders surplus. In addition, under NYIL, MBIA Insurance Corporation is required to invest its minimum surplus and contingency reserves and 50 of its loss reserves and unearned premium reserves in certain qualifying assets. As of September 30, 2024, MBIA Insurance Corporation maintained its minimum requirement of policyholders surplus but did not have enough qualifying assets to support its contingency reserves and 50 of its loss reserves and unearned premium reserves. As of September 30, 2024, MBIA Insurance Corporation was in compliance with its aggregate risk limits under the NYIL, but was not in compliance with certain of its single risk limits. Since MBIA Insurance Corporation does not comply with its single risk limits, the NYSDFS could prevent MBIA Insurance Corporation from transacting any new financial guarantee insurance business. MBIA Insurance Corporation is also required to maintain contingency reserves to provide protection to policyholders in the event of extreme losses in adverse economic events. MBIA Corp. maintains a fixed 5 million of contingency reserves. Due to its significant earned surplus deficit, MBIA Insurance Corporation has not had the statutory capacity to pay dividends since December 31, 2009. Based on estimated future income, MBIA Insurance Corporation is not expected to have any statutory capacity to pay dividends.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (continued) The NYSDFS has not approved MBIA Insurance Corporation s requests to make interest payments on MBIA Insurance Corporation s Surplus Notes due January 15, 2033 (the Surplus Notes since, and including, the January 15, 2013 interest payment. The NYSDFS has cited both MBIA Insurance Corporation s liquidity and financial condition as well as the availability of free and divisible surplus as the basis for such non-approvals. As of October 15, 2024, the most recent scheduled interest payment date, there was 1.5 billion of unpaid interest on the par amount outstanding of 953 million of the Surplus Notes. Under Section 1307 of the NYIL and the Fiscal Agency Agreement governing the surplus notes, Surplus Note payments may be made only with the prior approval by the NYSDFS and if MBIA Insurance Corporation has sufficient Eligible Surplus , or as we believe, free and divisible surplus as an appropriate calculation of Eligible Surplus. As of September 30, 2024, MBIA Insurance Corporation had free and divisible surplus of 64 million. There is no assurance the NYSDFS will approve Surplus Note payments, notwithstanding the sufficiency of MBIA Insurance Corporation s liquidity and financial condition. The unpaid interest on the Surplus Notes will become due on the first business day on or after which MBIA Insurance Corporation obtains approval to pay some or all of such unpaid interest. No interest has been accrued or will accrue on the deferred interest.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. Management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, and disclosure of critical accounting estimates with the Company s Audit Committee. Our most critical accounting estimates include loss and LAE reserves and valuation of financial instruments, since these estimates require significant judgment. Any modifications in these estimates could materially impact our financial results. For a discussion of the Company s critical accounting estimates, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, refer to Note 5: Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves and Note 6: Fair Value of Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a current description of estimates used in our insurance loss reserving process and information about our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value, including valuation techniques and significant inputs.

Item 3. Quantit ative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company s market risk exposures relate to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads that affect the fair value of its financial instruments, primarily investment securities, MTNs and investment agreement liabilities. The Company s investments are primarily U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-income securities including municipal bonds, U.S. government bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. In periods of rising and/or volatile interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads, profitability could be adversely affected should the Company have to liquidate these securities. The Company minimizes its exposure to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit spread movement through active portfolio management to ensure a proper mix of the types of securities held and to stagger the maturities of its fixed-income securities. There were no material changes in market risk since December 31, 2023 related to interest rates, foreign exchange rates credit spreads. For a discussion of our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4. Contro ls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. In addition, there have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER I NFORMATION Item 1. Leg al Proceedings For a discussion of the Company s litigation and related matters, see Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part I, Item 1. In the normal course of operating its businesses, MBIA Inc. may be involved in various legal proceedings. As a courtesy, the Company posts on its website under the section Legal Proceedings, selected information and documents in reference to selected legal proceedings in which the Company is the plaintiff or the defendant. The Company will not necessarily post all documents for each proceeding and undertakes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect changes in events or expectations. The complete official court docket can be publicly accessed by contacting the clerk s office of the respective court where each litigation is pending. Item 1A. Ri sk Factors The following should be read in conjunction with and supplements the risk factors described under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Insured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors Some of the state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities and other providers of public services, located in the U.S. or abroad, that issued public finance obligations we insured are experiencing fiscal stress that could result in increased credit losses or impairments on those obligations. Certain issuers are reporting fiscal stress that has resulted in a significant increase in taxes and/or a reduction in spending or other measures in efforts to satisfy their financial obligations. In particular, certain jurisdictions have significantly underfunded pension liabilities which are placing additional stress on their finances and are particularly challenging to restructure either through negotiation or under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. If the issuers of the obligations in our public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, or increase other revenues, cut spending, reduce liabilities, and/or receive state or federal assistance, we may experience losses or impairments on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial stress experienced by certain municipal issuers could result in the filing of Chapter 9 proceedings in states where municipal issuers are permitted to seek bankruptcy protection. In these proceedings, which remain rare, the resolution of bondholder claims (and by extension, those of bond insurers) may be subject to legal challenge by other creditors. In particular, while the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has completed its court-ordered restructuring pursuant to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act PROMESA ), the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority PREPA currently remains in a bankruptcy-like proceeding under PROMESA in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As of September 30, 2024, National had 670 million of insured debt service outstanding related to PREPA. On January 1, 2024 and July 1, 2024, PREPA defaulted on scheduled debt service for certain National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of 16 million and 122 million, respectively. On January 29, 2024, the First Circuit Court of Appeals heard argument on the appeal of Judge Swain's ruling on the scope of the bondholder liens and the allowed amount of the under-secured portion of the bondholders' unsecured claim. On June 12, 2024, the First Circuit reversed Judge Swain's prior rulings on bondholder liens and claim amounts. On June 26, 2024, the Oversight Board filed a petition for a First Circuit panel rehearing, and the Unsecured Creditors Committee filed an en banc appeal. Both are currently pending. Following a status conference held on July 10, 2024, the Court imposed a 60-day stay of all litigation and other filings related to the amended Plan, and ordered the parties into mediation. The stay was subsequently extended until January 31, 2025. The Oversight Board unilaterally altered the consideration provided in the amended PREPA RSA and, as a result, National provided notice to the Oversight Board that National did not support the board's actions and that such actions constituted a breach and termination of the PREPA RSA, as amended. There is no assurance that a plan that is substantially similar in the treatment of National's claims and rights will ultimately be confirmed and become effective. Refer to the U.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures section in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures.
