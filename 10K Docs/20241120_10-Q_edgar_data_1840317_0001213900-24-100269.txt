million and million, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of million as of September

activities have been financed through private placements of equity securities and debt to related parties.

million of related party debt to equity concurrently; and received million in proceeds from
the issuance of its convertible promissory note with a commitment from a convertible note purchaser for the remaining unfunded amount
of million, which is to be funded on or prior to November 15, 2024, subsequently extended to December 15, 2024. Following the Closing,
the Company received approximately million of net proceeds from Plum s trust account and received a cash tax refund of approximately
 million in respect to the Company s UK subsidiary s R D activities. Taking into account, the cash proceeds received
to date, the anticipated funding of the remaining convertible note commitment, the term sheet entered into with White Lion Capital, LLC
for access to a million Equity Line of Credit and the anticipated return by year end of the Company s million downpayment
for certain inventory purchased from iFREE Group Holdings Limited, the Company expects it will be able to funds its operations over the
next twelve months. The Company may seek additional funding through debt or other equity financing arrangements, implement incremental
expense reduction measures or a combination thereof to continue financing its operations. Although management continues to pursue these
plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to
fund continuing operations, if at all. See Note 17 Subsequent Events for further information regarding the Equity
Line of Credit. 

The Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things,
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 

The fair value of each stock option
granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the single-option award approach. 

The following assumptions are used in
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model: 

Risk-Free Interest Rate - The
risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on the date of grant on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities issued with
a term that is equal to the option s expected term at the grant date. 

Expected Volatility - The Company
estimates the volatility for option grants by evaluating the average historical volatility of a peer group of companies for the period
immediately preceding the option grant for a term that is approximately equal to the option s expected term. 

Expected Term - The expected
term represents the period over which options granted are expected to be outstanding using the simplified method, as the Company s
historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The simplified
method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and contractual life of the stock-based awards. 

Dividend Yield - The Company
has not declared or paid dividends to date and does not anticipate declaring dividends. As such, the dividend yield has been estimated
to be . 

share of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of per share (the Public Warrants ). Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO,
Plum completed the private sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants and together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants where each Private Placement Warrant allows the holder to purchase share of the Company s common stock at per share.
At September 30, 2024, there are Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants outstanding. 

The Public Warrants become exercisable
at per share, subject to adjustment, at any time commencing days after the completion of the Business Combination; provided
that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their warrants
on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement) and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from
registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. The warrants will expire five years
after the completion of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The Company has agreed that as soon
as practicable, but in no event later than twenty business days after the closing of the Business Combination, it will use commercially
reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become
effective within 60 business days after the closing of the Business Combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Common Stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in
the warrant agreement, provided that if the shares of Common Stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national
securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the
Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of the Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless
basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be
required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but the Company will use its commercially reasonably efforts to register
or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. If a registration statement covering
the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of the Business Combination,
warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have
failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of
the Securities Act or another exemption, but the Company will use its commercially reasonably efforts to register or qualify the shares
under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by
surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market
value (as defined below) less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) . The fair
market value as used in this paragraph shall mean the volume weighted average price of the shares of Common Stock for the 10 trading days
ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent. 

In no event will the Company be required
to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser
of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the shares of Common Stock underlying
such Warrant.

The Private Placement Warrants were
initially issued in the same form as the Public Warrants with the exception that the Private Warrants: (i) would not be redeemable by
the Company and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless baseless so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted
transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 

The Public Warrants were initially classified
as a derivative liability instrument. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, the Public Warrants in accordance with the guidance
contained in ASC 815 are no longer precluded from equity classification. Equity-classified contracts are initially measured at fair value
(or allocated value). Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized as long as the contracts continue to be classified in equity.

Private Placement Warrants as liabilities at fair value as of the Closing Date, with an offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital

Veea Edge Platform ePaaS is an end-to-end platform that is both locally- and cloud-managed. VeeaHub 
 products are converged computing and communications (i.e., hyperconverged) indoor
and outdoor devices, about the size of a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), that provide for networking and computing solutions for AI-assisted
applications and solutions at the edge where people, places, and things connect to the network. 

Veea Edge Platform provides
for highly secure connectivity, computing, and IoT solutions through full stack platform for digital transformation of industries as well
as unserved or underserved communities that lack Internet connectivity and essential applications and services. It further enables the
formation of highly secure, but easily accessible, private clouds and networks across one or multiple user(s) or enterprise location(s)
across the globe. We have redefined and simplified edge computing and connectivity with Veea Edge Platform, easily deployable products
that fully integrate hardware, system software, technologies, and edge applications. We are demonstrating, globally, that the Platform
enables our partners and customers to champion digital transformations in multiple vertical markets. 

Through our innovative Veea
Edge Platform, we have created a new product category that brings cloud capabilities close to the user, as an alternative to cloud computing,
with benefits in optimal latency, lower data transport costs, data privacy, security and ownership, Edge AI, always-on availability
at the edge for mission critical applications, and contextual awareness for people, devices and things connected to the Internet. The
Company was recognized in 2023 by Gartner for the innovativeness and capabilities of our Veea Edge Platfom and was named a Leading Smart

Veea earns revenue primarily from the
sale of its VeeaHub devices,
licenses and subscriptions. Veea incurred net losses of approximately 33.3 million and 46.4 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, respectively; net income and losses of approximately 2.0 million and 9.4 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Veea
generated net revenue of approximately 51,000 and 108,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, approximately
 9,000 and 40,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other than revenue generated from the license
of AdEdge in 2023, revenue has been immaterial for all periods presented and represented revenue earned from paid pilots for our
VeeaHub devices. 

Veea was founded in 2014
by Allen Salmasi, our Chief Executive Officer and a pioneering wireless technology leader. Mr. Salmasi helped to drive industry transformation

Recent Developments 

Business Combination 

On September 13, 2024 Plum
Acquisition Corp. I. Plum (NASDAQ: PLMI), a special purpose acquisition company, Legacy Veea consummated its previously
announced Business Combination. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination (the Closing (i) Plum de-registered
from the Register of Companies in the Cayman Islands by way of continuation out of the Cayman Islands and into the State of Delaware,
migrating to and domesticating as a Delaware corporation (the Domestication ), and (ii) the merger (the Merger of Plum Merger Sub with and into the Legacy Veea was completed and the separate corporate existence of Plum Merger Sub ceased, with Legacy
Veea as the surviving corporation becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Plum. Following the Closing, Plum changed its name from Plum
Acquisition Corp. I to Veea Inc. and Legacy Veea changed its name from Veea Inc. to VeeaSystems
Inc. 

31 

The Business Combination was
accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with GAAP.
A reverse recapitalization did not result in a new basis of accounting, and the financial statements of the combined entity represent
the continuation of the financial statements of Legacy Veea in many respects. 

Under this method of accounting,
Plum was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. For accounting purposes, Legacy Veea was deemed
to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of Legacy Veea (i.e.,
a capital transaction involving the issuance of stock by Plum for the stock of Legacy Veea). Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities
and results of operations of Legacy Veea became the historical financial statements of the combined company, and Plum s assets,
liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with the Company s beginning on the acquisition date. Operations prior to
the Business Combination were presented as those of Legacy Veea in future reports. The net assets of Legacy Veea were recognized at carrying
value, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. 

Private Placements 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the Business Combination, the Company and Private Veea issued convertible notes under note purchase agreements (the Note Purchase
Agreements with certain accredited investors unaffiliated with Plum and Legacy Veea (each, an Investor for the
sale of unsecured subordinated convertible promissory notes (the September 2024 Notes as part of a private placement offering
of up to 15 million in purchase price for such September 2024 Notes in the aggregate (the Financing Closing ). The Company
received 1.45 million in proceeds from the issuance of its convertible promissory note with a commitment from a convertible note purchaser
for the remaining unfunded amount of 13.55, which is to be funded on or prior to November 15, 2024, subsequently extended to December
15, 2024. In addition to a September 2024 Note, each Investor received as a transfer from NLabs immediately prior to the Financing Closing
a number of shares of Legacy Veea Series A-1 Preferred Stock that upon the Closing became a number of registered shares of Common Stock
equal to such Investors loan amount under their respective notes divided by 7.50 (the Transferred Shares ). 

The Company and Private Veea
are co-borrowers under each September 2024 Note (together, the Borrowers and are jointly responsible for the obligations
to each Investor thereunder. Each September 2024 Note has a maturity date of 18 months after the Financing Closing but is prepayable in
whole or in part by the Borrowers at any time without penalty. The outstanding obligations under each September 2024 Note accrues interest
at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 2 per annum, adjusted quarterly, but interest is only payable upon the maturity
date of the September 2024 Note as long as there is no event of default thereunder. Each September 2024 Note is unsecured and expressly
subordinated to any senior debt of the Borrowers. The September 2024 Notes and the Note Purchase Agreements do not include any operational
or financial covenants for the Borrowers. Each September 2024 Note includes customary events of default for failure to pay amounts due
on the maturity date, for failure to otherwise comply with the Borrowers covenants thereunder or for Borrower insolvency events,
in each case, with customary cure periods, and upon an event of default, the Investor may accelerate all obligations under its September
2024 Note and the Borrowers will be required to pay for the Investor s reasonable out-of-pocket collection costs. 

The outstanding obligations
under each September 2024 Note are convertible in whole or in part into shares of Common Stock (the Conversion Shares at
a conversion price of 7.50 per share (subject to equitable adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and the like with respect to
the Common Stock after the Financing Closing) (the Conversion Price at any time after the Financing Closing at the sole
election of the Investor. The outstanding obligations under each September 2024 Note will automatically convert at the Conversion Price
if (i) the Company or its subsidiaries consummate one or more additional financings for equity or equity-linked securities for at least
 20 million in the aggregate or makes one or more significant acquisitions valued in the aggregate (based on the consideration provided
by the Company and its subsidiaries) to be at least 20 million, (ii) the Investors holding a majority of the aggregate outstanding obligations
under the September 2024 Notes expressly agree to convert all obligations under the September 2024 Notes or (iii) the Common Stock trades
with an average daily VWAP of at least 10.00 (subject to equitable adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and the like with respect
to the Common Stock after the Financing Closing) for ten (10) consecutive trading days. The obligations under each September 2024 Note
will also automatically convert in connection with a Brokerage Transfer, as described below. 

The September 2024 Notes
and the Conversion Shares are subject to a lock-up for a period of 6 months after the Financing Closing (subject to early release for
a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company s stockholders having the
right to exchange their equity holdings in the Company for cash, securities or other property, and subject to customary permitted transfer
exceptions). The Transferred Shares are not be subject to any lock-up restrictions, but for a period of 6 months after the Closing they
will be separately designated by SPAC s transfer agent and kept as book entry shares on the transfer agent s records and will
not be eligible to be held by Depository Trust Company DTC without the Investor first notifying the Company of its intent
to transfer any such Transferred Shares to a brokerage account and/or to be held by DTC or another nominee (a Brokerage Transfer ).
If the Investor provides such notice or otherwise has any Transferred Shares subject to a Brokerage Transfer within 6 months after the
Closing, a portion of the outstanding obligations under such Investor s Note will automatically convert into a number of Conversion
Shares equal to the number of Transferred Shares subject to such Brokerage Transfer, and the lock-up period for such Conversion Shares
will be extended for an additional 6 months to 12 months after the Financing Closing. 

The Note Purchase Agreements
include customary registration rights.

Equity Line of Credit 

On November 15, 2024, the
Company and White Lion Capital, LLC White Lion signed a term sheet providing for the issuance by the Company to White
Lion of up to 25 million of shares of the Company s common stock. The Company anticipates closing the transactions contemplated
by the term sheet on or about November 20, 2004. At the closing, the Company and White Lion will enter into a common stock purchase agreement
(the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and related registration rights agreement (the White Lion Registration Rights
Agreement ). Pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to White Lion up to the lesser of
(i) 25,000,000 shares of common stock ELOC Shares) and (ii) the Purchase Notice Limit (as defined in the Common Stock Purchase
Agreement), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. As of the Issuance Date, the
Company has not filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 registering the resale of the ELOC Shares. The Company expects to utilize proceeds
from the Common Stock Purchase Agreement for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Subject to the terms of the Common
Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company will have the right from time to time at its sole discretion until the 24th month following signing
of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, to direct White Lion to purchase up to a specified maximum number of shares of common stock as
set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement by delivering written notice to White Lion prior to the commencement of trading on any
trading day. The Company will control the timing and amount of any sales of the common stock to White Lion. Actual sales of shares to
White Lion under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to
time, including, among other things, market conditions, and the trading price of the common stock. 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenue, net 

The Company recognizes revenue
based on the satisfaction of distinct obligations to transfer goods and services to customers. The Company generates revenue from hardware
sales and the sale of licenses and subscriptions. The Company applies a five-step approach as defined in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify
the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when a corresponding performance obligation is satisfied. Most contracts with customers
are to provide distinct products or services within a single contract. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance
obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone
selling price. 

For licenses of technology,
recognition of revenue is dependent upon whether the Company has delivered rights to the technology, and whether there are future performance
obligations under the contract. Revenue from non-refundable upfront payments is recognized when the license is transferred to the customer
and the Company has no other performance obligations. Revenue for licenses delivered under a subscription model having terms between one
and twelve-months are recognized over-time. Subscription revenue is generated through sales of monthly subscriptions. Customers pay in
advance for the licenses and subscriptions. Revenue is initially deferred and is recognized using the straight-line method over the term
of the applicable subscription period.

primarily of the cost of finished goods, components purchased for manufacturing and freight. Cost of goods sold also includes third-party
vendor costs related to cloud hosting fees.

Revenue, net 

The Company generated revenue of 50,683 and 9,009,254 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company generated revenue of 108,264 and 9,040,359 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue has been principally earned from paid pilots for our VeeaHub devices.
The decrease was due to 9 million income recognized in connection with the license of AdEdge in 2023. 

Our focus over the past several
years has been on field testing and refining our product to meet customer needs as well as market developments. As a result of these efforts,
we expect revenue to grow over the next several quarters through the sales of our hardware, licenses and subscriptions. We are especially
focused in four principal market opportunities: 1) Digital Equity and Inclusion, 2) Energy and Sustainability solutions for Smart Buildings
and Climate Smart Agriculture, 3) Convergence of Fixed, Wireless, and 5G Networks, and 4) Smart Retail and Smart Warehouses. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold decreased
by approximately 9,310, or 38 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost
of goods sold increased by 10,524, or 22 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The increase is immaterial as it is related to the costs incurred to generate our revenue earned from paid pilots for our VeeaHub 
devices. 

Product Development Expense 

Product development expense
increased by 170,997, or 92 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Product
development expense increased by 476,327, or 70 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in product development expenses was due to increased internal development and additional costs incurred by outside
contractors related to products manufactured during the period. 

Sales and Marketing Expense 

Sales and marketing expense decreased by 57,006, or 41 , in the three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expense increased by 160,211,
or 54 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the third quarter, management
had reduced efforts in marketing as the focus was on the Business Combination completion. The year-to-date increase was due primarily
to an increase in customer evaluations and fees paid to third-party marketing firm during the period. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative
expense decreased by 3.2 million, or 62 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. General and administrative expense increased by 0.6 million, or 5 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for the quarter is primarily related to the foreign exchange gain of 1.8 million for
the three months ended, as well as a reclassification of 1.4 million of transaction related expenses out of G A in the period the
Business Combination occurred. The year-to-date overall increase was primarily due to an increase in net foreign exchange losses, as well
as an increase in professional and consulting fees relating to the Business Combination. 

35 

Transaction costs including those incurred
with contingent earn-out liability 

Following the closing of
the Business Combination, holders of certain capital stock of Legacy Veea immediately prior to the closing will have the contingent right
to receive up to 4.5 million additional shares of the Company s common stock if certain trading-price based milestones of the Company s
common stock are achieved or a change of control transaction occurs during the ten-year period following the Closing. The initial value
of the contingent earn-out share liability of 53.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is recorded as a transaction
cost within operating expenses. The fair value of the earn-out liabilities was estimated using Monte Carlo simulation utilizing assumptions
related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility, the price of the Common Stock and current interest rates. A
significant driver of the value of the earn-out at the close of the Business Combination was our closing stock price on September 13,
2024 which was 12.00. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately 1.4 million of professional fees relating to the Business Combination. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization
decreased by 7,588, or 10 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation
and amortization decreased by 529,195, or 72 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was due to certain intangibles reaching the end of their useful lives. 

Other income, net 

Other income, net relates
to immaterial non-operating transactions incurred during the period. These amounts were immaterial for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

UK R D Tax Credit 

The increase is related to
the receipt of an R D tax credit of 1.2 million received by the Company s UK subsidiary. 

Loss on initial issuance of convertible
note 

The loss on initial measurement
of the convertible note was 1,770,993 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Convertible Note Payable was entered
into in September 2024. 

Change in fair value of derivative liabilities 

Change
in fair value of derivative liabilities comprised of the fair value adjustment to the conversion option, Private Warrants, and earn-out
shares at balance sheet date. The gain on the change in fair value of conversion note option liability was 797,500 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The loss of the change in fair value
of warrant liabilities was 220,373 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was determined based on the trading value
of the public warrants. The loss on the change in fair value of earn out share liability was 24.8 million for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. A significant driver of the value of the earn-out at the close
of the Business Combination was our closing stock price on September 30, 2024 which was 6.50. These derivative instruments were entered
into in September 2024 related to the Business Combination. 

Other expense 

Other expenses relate to
immaterial non-operating expenses incurred during the period. These amounts were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense decreased
by 1.3 million, or 75 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest
expense decreased by 3.1 million, or 69 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The decrease was due to loans coming to term or being converted into equity. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To date, we have financed
our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities and debt to. We plan to fund our operations and capital funding
needs through a combination of private and public equity and debt offerings, or a combination thereof. Since our inception, we have incurred
significant operating losses and negative cash flows. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of
 216.9 million and 170.3 million, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 2.8 million and 6.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had 14.15 million outstanding
debt, of which approximately 1.45 million was outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement and 12.7 million was outstanding under our
working capital facility. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has incurred net losses of 46.6 million and 9.4 million, respectively, and had an accumulated
deficit of 216.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses as it continues to grow and scale
its business. Historically, the Company s activities have been financed through private placements, of equity securities and debt
to related parties. 

36 

At the Closing of the Business Combination, the Company converted approximately 16 million
of related party debt to equity concurrently; and received 1.45 million in proceeds from the issuance of its convertible promissory note
with a commitment from an Investor for the remaining unfunded amount of approximately 13.6 million, which is to be funded on or prior
to November 15, 2024, subsequently extended to December 15, 2024. Following the Closing, the Company received approximately 1.1 million
of proceeds from Plum s trust account and received a cash tax refund approximately 1.2 million in respect to the Company s
UK subsidiary s R D activities. Taking into account the cash proceeds received to date, the anticipated funding of the remaining
convertible note commitment, the proceeds receivable under the 25 million Equity Line of Credit with White Lion Capital, LLC and the
anticipated return by year end of the Company s 5 million downpayment for certain inventory purchased from iFREE Group Holdings
Limited and, the Company expects it will be able to funds its operations over the next twelve months. The Company may seek additional
funding through debt or other equity financing arrangements, implement incremental expense reduction measures or a combination thereof
to continue financing its operations. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will
be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our consolidated
financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as described below, to understand
and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by
other companies, is presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered
a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

The primary financial measure
we use is Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income, before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted
EBITDA as net (loss) income excluding income tax provision, interest expense, net of interest income from related party loans, depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-core expenses/losses (gains), including transaction-related costs, litigation-related
costs, management fees, change in fair value of warrant liability, change in fair value of earn-out share liabilities and other expense,
which includes asset impairments. Our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business and this measure
is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based. We exclude the above items as some are non-cash in nature, and
others are non-recurring that they may not be representative of normal operating results. This non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for
the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of the operational performance of our business. While we believe that this non-GAAP
financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant
as a substitute for the related financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

The following table provides
a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the periods presented:
