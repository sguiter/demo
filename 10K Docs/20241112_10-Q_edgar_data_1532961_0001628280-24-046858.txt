 See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets , for further information on goodwill and identified intangibles. 
 There have been no material changes in the Company's significant accounting policies described in the audited financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
 Correction of Previously Issued Financial Statements 
 In mid-October 2024, in the course of completing the preparation of these unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company identified out of period misstatements related to the estimated time to complete ("ETC") on acquired percentage-of-completion ("POC") projects related to the February 2023 acquisition of Continental Mapping Acquisition Corp. and its subsidiaries, including Axim Geospatial, LLC (collectively "Axim"). Incorrect ETCs utilized as part of purchase accounting created a misstatement of the Company's unbilled receivables, goodwill, intangible assets (customer relationships, backlog, and non-competes), and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts. Incorrect ETCs further created a misstatement of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, retained earnings, gross revenues, sub-consultant services, gross profit, amortization expense, income before income tax benefit (expense), income tax benefit (expense), net income, and earnings per share in the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the period ending December 30, 2023, the interim periods in the Form 10-Qs filed within fiscal year 2023, and the most recently filed Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended March 30, 2024, and June 29, 2024. The Company assessed the materiality of the errors, including the presentation on prior period consolidated financial statements, on a qualitative and quantitative basis in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topics 1.M and 1.N (formerly No. 99, Materiality) , codified in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections . 
 Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that these errors and the related impacts did not result in a material misstatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ending December 30, 2023, the interim periods on the Form 10-Qs filed within fiscal year 2023, and the most recently filed Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended March 30, 2024, and June 29, 2024. However, correcting the cumulative effect of these errors in the three months ended September 28, 2024 would have a significant effect on the results of operations for the periods. Accordingly, the Company revised its historical financial statements prospectively to correct these errors and to facilitate comparisons of the Company's current results to prior periods.

The difference between the effective income tax rate and the combined statutory federal and state income tax rate was primarily due to an increase in federal tax credits and a decrease in the recognition of excess tax benefits from stock-based payments during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company evaluates tax positions for recognition using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, and those tax positions eligible for recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon the effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Fiscal years 2012 through 2014 are considered open tax years in the State of California. Fiscal years 2020 through 2023 are considered open tax years in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, state jurisdictions, including the State of California, and foreign jurisdictions. It is not expected that there will be a significant change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

This Quarterly Report contains, in addition to unaudited historical information, forward-looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. The words believe, expect, estimate, may, will, could, plan, or continue, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, those discussed under the headings Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, if any. Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to (and we expressly disclaim any obligation to) revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, or otherwise (except as may be required by law), in order to reflect any event or circumstance which may arise after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Amounts presented are in thousands, except per share data. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a provider of technology, conformity assessment, consulting solutions, and software applications to public and private sector clients. We focus on the infrastructure, utility services, construction, real estate, environmental, and geospatial markets. Our primary clients include U.S. Federal, state, municipal, and local government agencies, and military and defense clients. We also serve quasi-public and private sector clients from the education, healthcare, utility services, and public utilities, including schools, universities, hospitals, health care providers, and insurance providers. 
 Fiscal Year 
 We operate on a "52/53 week" fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to the calendar quarter end. 
 Recent Acquisitions 
 We have completed six acquisitions during 2024. The aggregate purchase price for the six acquisitions was 65,159, including 56,427 in cash, 3,534 of our common stock, and potential earn-outs of up to 14,100 payable in cash, which were recorded at an estimated fair value of 5,198. The cash portions of the purchase prices and other related costs associated with the transactions were partially financed through the Company's amended and restated credit agreement (the "Second A R Credit Agreement" or "Senior Credit Facility") with Bank of America, N.A. and other lenders party thereto. See Note 10, Notes Payable and Other Obligations , of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein for further detail on the Second A R Credit Agreement. An option-based model and a probability-weighted approach were used to determine the fair value of the earn-outs, which are generally accepted valuation techniques that embody all significant assumption types. In order to determine the fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of fair values. The final determination of the fair values of assets and liabilities will be completed within the one-year measurement period as required by ASC 805. The 2024 acquisitions will necessitate the use of this measurement period to adequately analyze and assess the factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the relevant acquisition date, including intangible assets, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deferred tax liabilities, and other certain liabilities. 
 Segments 
 Our operations are organized into three operating and reportable segments:

 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 The following table represents our condensed results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Gross revenues 250,885 237,545 694,750 642,301 Direct costs 121,375 123,281 333,707 324,040 Gross profit 129,510 114,264 361,043 318,261 Operating expenses 108,995 99,511 327,400 275,190 Income from operations 20,515 14,753 33,643 43,071 Interest expense (4,547) (3,882) (13,344) (9,111) Income tax benefit (expense) 1,110 2,185 2,250 (382) Net income 17,078 13,056 22,549 33,578 
 Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Gross Revenues 
 Our consolidated gross revenues increased by 13,340, or 5.6 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross revenues was primarily due to incremental gross revenues from acquisitions of 14,308 completed since the third quarter of 2023 and organic increases in our international engineering and consulting services of 5,225, geospatial solutions business of 5,171, and infrastructure services of 2,830. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our liquefied natural gas ("LNG") business of 12,468 driven by project cycles and our power delivery and utility services of 1,773. 
 Gross Profit 
 As a percentage of gross revenues, our gross profit margin was 51.6 and 48.1 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As a percentage of gross revenues, other direct costs and sub-consultant services decreased 3.5 and 0.2 , respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct salaries and wages as a percentage of gross revenues of 0.2 . The decrease in sub-consultant services as a percentage of gross revenues was primarily driven by an increased proportion of infrastructure services that utilizes less sub-consultant services and a mix of business in our geospatial solutions business requiring a lower level of sub-consultant services. The decrease in other direct costs as a percentage of gross revenues was primarily driven by a decrease in the proportion of our LNG business. 
 Operating expenses 
 Our operating expenses increased 9,484, or 9.5 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses primarily resulted from increased payroll costs of 6,660 and amortization expenses of 1,923. The increase in payroll costs was primarily driven by an increase in employees as compared to the prior year period driven by our 2023 and 2024 acquisitions. The increase in amortization expense was driven by acquisitions. 
 Interest Expense 
 Our interest expense increased 665 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in our Senior Credit Facility indebtedness. 
 41 

Income taxes 
 Our effective income tax rate was (7.0 and (20.1 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of an increase in income before income taxes and a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based payments in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in federal tax credits. 
 Net income 
 Our net income increased 4,022, or 30.8 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in gross profit of 15,246, partially offset by increases in payroll costs of 6,660 and amortization expenses of 1,923, and a decrease in income tax benefits of 1,075. 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Gross Revenues 
 Our consolidated gross revenues increased by 52,449, or 8.2 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross revenues was primarily due to incremental gross revenues from acquisitions of 51,883 completed since the beginning of fiscal 2023 and organic increases in our international engineering and consulting services of 10,034, infrastructure services of 8,116, geospatial solutions business of 6,853, civil program management services of 4,532, and real estate transaction services of 1,793. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our LNG business of 21,553 driven by project cycles and our power delivery and utility services of 5,447. 
 Gross Profit 
 As a percentage of gross revenues, our gross profit margin was 52.0 and 49.6 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As a percentage of gross revenues, other direct costs and sub-consultant services decreased 1.8 and 1.0 , respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct salaries and wages as a percentage of gross revenues of 0.4 . The decrease in sub-consultant services as a percentage of gross revenues was primarily driven by an increased proportion of infrastructure services that utilizes less sub-consultant services and a mix of business in our geospatial solutions business requiring a lower level of sub-consultant services. The decrease in other direct costs as a percentage of gross revenues was primarily driven by a decrease in the proportion of our LNG business. 
 Operating expenses 
 Our operating expenses increased 52,210, or 19.0 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses primarily resulted from increased payroll costs of 28,583, general and administrative expenses of 14,592, and amortization expenses of 7,366. The increase in payroll costs was primarily driven by an increase in employees as compared to the prior year period driven by our 2023 and 2024 acquisitions. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to earn-out fair value adjustments of 7,518 that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that decreased the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions and incremental expenses from acquisitions of 5,193. The increase in amortization expense was driven by acquisitions. 
 Interest Expense 
 Our interest expense increased 4,233 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense resulted from a higher weighted average interest rate and an increase in our Senior Credit Facility indebtedness. 
 Income taxes 
 Our effective income tax rate was (11.1 and 1.1 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of an increase in federal tax credits, partially offset by a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based payments. 
 42 

Net income 
 Our net income decreased 11,029, or 32.8 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of increases in payroll costs of 28,583, general and administrative expenses of 14,592, amortization expenses of 7,366, and interest expense of 4,233, partially offset by an increase in gross profit of 42,782.

 Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 INF Segment 
 Our gross revenues from INF decreased 1,245, or 1.2 , during the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross revenues was primarily due to a decreases in our LNG business of 12,468 driven by project cycles.

 43 

Segment income before taxes from GEO increased 8,215, or 55.6 , during the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gross revenues. 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 INF Segment 
 Our gross revenues from INF increased 4,913, or 1.7 , during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross revenues was primarily due to incremental gross revenues of 20,810 from acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal 2023 and organic increases in our infrastructure services of 8,116 and civil program management services of 4,532. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our LNG business of 21,553 driven by project cycles and in our power delivery and utility services of 5,447. 
 Segment income before taxes from INF decreased 915, or 1.8 , during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased margins driven by our LNG business, partially offset by increased gross revenues. 
 BTS Segment 
 Our gross revenues from BTS increased 25,168, or 15.3 , during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross revenues was primarily due to incremental gross revenues of 15,558 from acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal 2023 and organic increases in our international engineering and consulting services of 10,034 and real estate transactional services of 1,793. These increases were partially offset by decreases in our environmental health sciences services of 2,106. 
 Segment income before taxes from BTS increased 4,669, or 17.4 during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gross revenues. 
 GEO Segment 
 Our gross revenues from GEO increased 22,368, or 11.7 , during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross revenues was primarily due to incremental revenue of 15,515 from acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal 2023 and organic increases in our geospatial solution services of 6,853. 
 Segment income before taxes from GEO increased 11,615, or 33.8 , during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased gross revenues. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Facility, and access to financial markets. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, repayment of debt, and acquisition expenditures. We believe our sources of liquidity, including cash flows from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We will monitor our capital requirements thereafter to ensure our needs are in line with available capital resources and believe that there are no significant cash requirements currently known to us and affecting our business that cannot be met from our reasonably expected future operating cash flows, including upon the maturity of the Senior Credit Facility in 2026. 
 Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 57,111 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 45,435 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of increases in our net income adjusted for noncash items, partially offset by changes in working capital. The changes in our working capital that contributed to decreased cash flows from operations was primarily a result of decreases in advanced billings and accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities of 8,726 and 7,392, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of 11,813. The decrease in advanced billings was primarily due to timing of project billing cycles. The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to a 4,869 decrease in taxes payable and a 2,839 decrease in accrued operating expenses. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of payments. 
 44 

Investing activities 
 During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities totaled 67,487 and 203,071, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of decreased cash paid for acquisitions of 134,762. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 38,293 during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to 165,727 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of decreased borrowings on our Senior Credit Facility of 130,000 during the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Financing 
 Senior Credit Facility 
 On August 13, 2021 (the "Closing Date"), we amended and restated our Credit Agreement (the "Second A R Credit Agreement" or "Senior Credit Facility"), originally dated December 7, 2016 and as amended to the Closing Date, with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), as administrative agent, swingline lender and letter of credit issuer, the other lenders party thereto, and certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors. Pursuant to the Second A R Credit Agreement, the previously drawn term commitments of 150,000 and revolving commitments totaling 215,000 in the aggregate were converted into revolving commitments totaling 400,000 in the aggregate. These revolving commitments are available through August 13, 2026 (the "Maturity Date") and an aggregate amount of approximately 138,750 was drawn under the Second A R Credit Amendment on the Closing Date to repay previously existing borrowings under the term and revolving facilities prior to such amendment and restatement. Borrowings under the Second A R Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets. The Second A R Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature permitting us to request an increase in the revolving facility under the Second A R Credit Agreement by an additional amount of up to 200,000 in the aggregate. As of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Second A R Credit Agreement was 241,750 and 195,750, respectively. 
 Borrowings under the Second A R Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates which are, at our option, tied to a Eurocurrency rate equal either Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or Daily Simple SOFR, plus in each case an applicable margin, or a base rate denominated in U.S. dollars. Interest rates remain subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 28, 2024 our weighted average interest rate was 6.7 . 
 The Second A R Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio (the ratio of our pro forma consolidated net funded indebtedness to our pro forma consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed measurement period) of no greater than 4.00 to 1.00. 
 These financial covenants also require us to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.00 as of the end of any measurement period. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants. 
 The Second A R Credit Agreement contains covenants that may have the effect of limiting our ability to, among other things, merge with or acquire other entities, enter into a transaction resulting in a Change in Control, create certain new liens, incur certain additional indebtedness, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, or engage in new lines of business, or sell a substantial part of their assets. The Second A R Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including (but not limited to) a default in the payment of principal or, following an applicable grace period, interest, breaches of our covenants or warranties under the Second A R Credit Agreement, payment default or acceleration of certain indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, certain judgments or uninsured losses, changes in control, and certain liabilities related to ERISA based plans. 
 The Second A R Credit Agreement limits the payment of cash dividends (together with certain other payments that would constitute a "Restricted Payment" within the meaning of the Second A R Credit Agreement and generally including dividends, stock repurchases, and certain other payments in respect to warrants, options, and other rights to acquire equity securities), unless the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would be less than 3.25 to 1.00 and available liquidity (defined as unrestricted, domestically held cash plus revolver availability) would be at least 30,000, in each case after giving effect to such payment. 
 45 

Total debt issuance costs incurred and capitalized in connection with the issuance of the Second A R Credit Agreement were 3,702. Total amortization of debt issuance costs was 185 and 556 during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and 208 and 573 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Other Obligations 
 We have aggregate obligations related to acquisitions of 3,122, 3,881, and 4,010 due in the remainder of fiscal 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, our weighted average interest rate on other outstanding obligations was 3.7 .

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.

 our ability to complete our backlog of uncompleted projects as currently projected, 
 the risk of employee misconduct or our failure to comply with laws and regulations, 
 our ability to control, and operational issues pertaining to, business activities that we conduct with business partners and other third parties, 
 our need to comply with a number of restrictive covenants and similar provisions in our senior credit facility that generally limit our ability to (among other things) incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make acquisitions, pay dividends and undergo certain changes in control, which could affect our ability to finance future operations, acquisitions or capital needs, 
 significant influence by our principal stockholder and the existence of certain anti-takeover measures in our governing documents, and 
 other factors identified throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those discussed under the headings Risk Factors, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Business. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business. We have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We have no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes related to the promissory notes related to acquisitions since these contain fixed interest rates. Our only debt subject to interest rate risk is the Senior Credit Facility which rates are variable, at our option, tied to a Eurocurrency rate equal to either Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or Daily Simple SOFR, plus in each case an applicable rate or a base rate denominated in U.S. dollars. Interest rates are subject to change based on our Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of September 28, 2024, there was 241,750 outstanding on the Senior Credit Facility. A one percentage point change in the assumed interest rate of the Senior Credit Facility would change our annual interest expense by approximately 2,418 annually. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Company's Executive Chairman and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of and for the period ending September 28, 2024, the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting as described below. The material weakness described herein did not result in a material misstatement to the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements, nor in the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 In February 2023, the Company acquired Continental Mapping Acquisition Corp. and its subsidiaries, including Axim Geospatial, LLC (collectively Axim ). As the Company was in the process of a broader enterprise resource planning ("ERP") implementation, the Company delayed its ERP integration of Axim. As a result, certain of the Company s project revenue controls at Axim were not designed at a sufficiently precise level. The Company has determined these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness. 
 Remediation Plan for Material Weakness 
 The Company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. The Company is integrating Axim into the Company s ERP system and its enhanced processes and controls as planned. The enhanced processes and controls under the Company s ERP system will provide more detailed set up and review of Axim s projects and a more comprehensive periodic analysis related to Axim s percentage of completion projects. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and refine its remediation plan as appropriate. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 As described above, the Company is taking steps to remediate the material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. Other than the remediation process described above, there were no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 48 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business activities. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not a party to any litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 There have been no material changes to any of the principal risks that we believe are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition, from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, except as follows: 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not timely remediated, may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our future financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as may lead to a loss of investor confidence in us. 
 As described under Item 4. Controls and Procedures above, management has concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of September 30, 2024. This material weakness related to project revenue internal controls at Axim (a February 2023 acquisition) which were not designed at a sufficiently precise level. Accordingly, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 While we believe the steps described under Item 4 above will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the identified deficiencies, if our remediation efforts are insufficient to address the material weakness or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information accurately, to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and to otherwise comply with our reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and our long-term debt agreements will likely be adversely affected. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, this material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and have other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business, including an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.
