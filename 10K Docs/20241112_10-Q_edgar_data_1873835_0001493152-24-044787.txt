CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INDUSTRY DATA 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ). These statements may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as may, 
 should, expects, intends, plans, anticipates, believes, 
 estimates, predicts, potential, continue or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. Our forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections
about our company, are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve substantial risks and uncertainty. We may not actually
achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially
from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Our business and our forward-looking statements
involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements regarding: 

our
 projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate; 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements; 

our
 ability to continue as a going concern; 

our
 need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations, the availability and terms of such funding, and dilution caused
 thereby; 

the
 success, cost and timing of our clinical trials; 

our
 dependence on third parties in the conduct of our clinical trials; 

our
 ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market and commercialize our product candidates; 

the
 ultimate impact of a health epidemic, on our business, our clinical trials, our research programs, healthcare systems or the global
 economy as a whole; 

the
 potential that results of pre-clinical and clinical trials indicate our current product candidates or any future product candidates
 we may seek to develop are unsafe or ineffective; 

the
 results of market research conducted by us or others; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our current and future product candidates; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the potential for us to incur substantial costs from lawsuits to enforce
 or protect our intellectual property rights; 

the
 possibility that a third party may claim we or our third-party licensors have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their
 intellectual property rights and that we may incur substantial costs and be required to devote substantial time defending against
 claims against us; 

our
 reliance on third-party suppliers and manufacturers; 

the
 success of competing therapies and products that are or become available; 

our
 ability to expand our organization to accommodate potential growth and our ability to retain and attract key personnel; 

the
 potential for us to incur substantial costs resulting from product liability lawsuits against us and the potential for these product
 liability lawsuits to cause us to limit our commercialization of our product candidates; 

market
 acceptance of our product candidates, the size and growth of the potential markets for our current product candidates and any future
 product candidates we may seek to develop, and our ability to serve those markets; and 

the
 successful development of our commercialization capabilities, including sales and marketing capabilities. 

All
of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q only. In each case, actual results may differ
materially from such forward-looking information. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will
prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties
referred to in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024, this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic reports or other documents or filings filed with
or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC could materially and adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Except as required by law, we do not undertake or plan to update or revise
any such forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or projections or other circumstances
affecting such forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, even if such results, changes
or circumstances make it clear that any forward-looking information will not be realized. Any public statements or disclosures by us
following this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include market data and certain industry data and forecasts, which we may obtain from internal company
surveys, market research, consultant surveys, publicly available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications,
articles and surveys. Industry surveys, publications, consultant surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained
therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed.
While we believe that such studies and publications are reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party
sources, and we have not commissioned any such information.

 Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

The
Company has expended and plans to continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research, development and clinical testing of
product candidates. The Company also will be required to expend additional funds to establish commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements
and to provide for the marketing and distribution of products that receive regulatory approval. The Company may require additional funds
to commercialize its products. The Company is unable to entirely fund these efforts with its current financial resources and will need
to raise additional funding in the future. If adequate funds are unavailable on a timely basis from operations or additional sources
of financing, the Company may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research or development programs which
may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and operations. 

owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. For
previously consolidated entities where the Company owned less than of the subsidiary, the Company recorded net loss attributable
to non-controlling interests in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss equal to the percentage of
the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective non-controlling parties.

worth of shares of its common stock as the aggregate market value of the Company s shares of common stock eligible for sale under
the July Sales Agreement is subject to the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 until such time that the Company s
public float equals or exceeds million. In the event the aggregate market value of the Company s outstanding common stock
held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds million, then the one-third limitation on sales set forth in General Instruction I.B.6
of Form S-3 shall not apply to additional sales made pursuant to the July Sales Agreement. 

From
July 14, 2023 through February 5, 2024, the Company has sold common shares pursuant to the July ATM Facility for net proceeds
of , after offering expenses. On February 5, 2024, the Company suspended, and is not offering any shares of its common stock
pursuant to, the prospectus supplement dated July 14, 2023, relating to the July Sales Agreement by and between the Company and the Sales
Agent. The Company will not make any sales of common stock pursuant to the July Sales Agreement unless and until a new prospectus supplement
is filed with the SEC; however, the July Sales Agreement remains in full force and effect. 

In
February 2024, the Company conducted an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock at the public offering price
of per share, for net proceeds of , after underwriter discounts and offering expenses (the Offering ).
Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the Company granted the underwriter a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional
 shares of the Company s common stock, which was exercised in full on March 1, 2024, for net proceeds of , after
underwriting discounts and offering expenses (see Note 7). 

On
July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an 
million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to support the clinical development of chimeric antigen
receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon
achievement of milestones that are primarily based on patient enrollment in the Company s clinical trials. Additionally, if
CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied with the terms and conditions of the grant, CIRM may
suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs
specifically identified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized
supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study costs. Under the terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the
research project and the amount of the Company s co-funding requirement is predetermined as a part of the award. The Company
signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in November of
2024. 

The
Company has a history of, and expects to continue to report, negative cash flows from operations and net losses. We believe that our
existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.

purposes of basic loss per common share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s potentially

basis of Nexcella, par value per share (the Nexcella Shares ), and of the outstanding shares of each other
class of capital stock of Nexcella. Under the DGCL, the only approval required was that of the Company s Board of Directors for
the Merger to become effective. As a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations and other property and
rights of Nexcella have been succeeded to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger,
each of the outstanding Nexcella Shares (other than Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted into common stock of the Company Company Merger Shares ). In connection with the Merger, the Company issued shares of its common stock to the former
stockholders of Nexcella (other than shares held by the Company) (including Company common stock issued to third-party cash investors
in Nexcella) (the Merger Shares ). The shares were issued on a pro-rata basis and as such resulted in no change in fair
value. In addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, restricted stock
awards to receive common stock in the Company and options to purchase up to shares of Company common stock at an exercise price
of per share (the closing price on May 17, 2024), under the Company s Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive
Plan. As such, as of May 20, 2024, the Founders Agreement and Management Services Agreement agreements listed below with Nexcella are
no longer in effect.

Overview 

Immix
Biopharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the application of chimeric antigen receptor cell therapy CAR-T in light chain (AL) Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases. Our lead cell therapy candidate is U.S.
Food and Drug Administration FDA investigational new drug IND cleared CAR-T NXC-201, currently being
evaluated in our ongoing United States Phase 1b/2 NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) clinical trial and our ex-U.S. phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1
(NCT04720313) clinical trial. 

NXC-201 has been awarded Orphan
Drug Designation ODD by both the FDA and European Commission EMA in AL Amyloidosis. 

25 

Our
mission is to harness the immune system through innovative cell therapies and other modalities to deliver widely accessible cures in
select immune-mediated diseases and other indications, as we believe patients are waiting. 

Our
strategy is to: 

Develop
 our lead candidate CAR-T NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases; and 

Pursue
 development of NXC-201 and additional cell therapy candidates in other applicable indications where CAR-T is not an approved therapy
 today. 

Our
N-GENIUS platform has produced our clinical-stage lead candidate NXC-201, a next-generation CAR-T for AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated
diseases.

NXC-201
is in clinical trials to treat relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. 

AL
amyloidosis is a life-threatening immunological disorder in which an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in tissues and organs.
This abnormal protein is produced by long-lived plasma cells LLPCs ), a type of immune B-cell. The signs and symptoms of
AL amyloidosis vary among patients because build-up may occur in the heart (most frequent cause of mortality), liver, kidneys, intestines,
muscles, joints, nerves, or spleen, according to the National Institutes of Health NIH ). Diagnosis is frequently delayed,
due to varied and non-specific symptoms including: fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, dizziness, and numbness in hands and feet.
Upon diagnosis, many patients already have late-stage disease, and are not aware of available treatment options and clinical trials. 

As of September
2024, there are no FDA approved drugs for relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. 

The
U.S. observed prevalence of relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis is growing 12 per year according to Staron, et al Blood Cancer Journal
2021, estimated to reach 33,277 patients in 2024. Untreated patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac involvement have a median survival
of less than 1 year, according to Quock, et al. Journal of Comparative Effective Research, 2023. The current market size for amyloidosis
therapies is estimated at 3.6 billion, expected to reach 6 billion in 2027, according to Grand View Research. 

26 

As
of September 2024, we have treated 3 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients in the United States in our ongoing Phase 1b/2 multi-site NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) U.S. clinical trial. Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is the lead NEXICART-2 clinical site. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have treated 13 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a NEXICART-1
(NCT04720313) ex-U.S. clinical trial. 

In
September 2023, the FDA granted ODD to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis. If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the
first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity),
which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for 7 years (except in
limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity). 

In
November 2023, the FDA cleared an IND application for NXC-201 to enroll U.S. patients into NXC-201 clinical trials. 

In
December 2023, NXC-201 clinical data in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis was presented in an oral presentation at the 65 th 
annual American Society of Hematology ASH meeting, covering 10 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients treated with
NXC-201, indicating an overall response rate of 100 (10/10) and a complete response rate of 70 (7/10). 

In
February 2024, the European Commission EC granted orphan drug designation to NXC-201 for the treatment of AL Amyloidosis.
Benefits of European ODD include: 10 years of market exclusivity once authorized in the EU; Access to the EU centralized authorization
procedure; and reduced fees for EU protocol assistance, marketing authorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications
for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees. 

Our
Other Programs 

Our
other programs include NXC-201 for select immune-mediated diseases, a 25 billion combined annual market size according to Grand View
Research and Fortune Business Insights and other preclinical candidates. 

While
our focus is NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis and select immune-mediated diseases, we continue to collect and organize IMX-110 data in monotherapy
for soft tissue sarcoma, a 3 billion market size according to Medgadget, and in combination with anti-PD-1 for colorectal cancer, a
 27 billion market size according to IndustryARC, to evaluate next steps. 

Since
inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development,
organizing and staffing our Company, business planning and raising capital. We operate as one business segment and have incurred recurring
losses, the majority of which are attributable to research and development activities and negative cash flows from operations. We have
funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. Currently, our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses,
which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We
expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates
through all stages of development and clinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain regulatory
approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing,
marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal,
accounting, investor relations and other expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year,
depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenses on other research and development activities.

Absorption
of Nexcella Subsidiary 

On
May 20, 2024, Nexcella, was merged (the Merger with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation.
The Merger was effected pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL when the Company filed a
Certificate of Ownership and Merger Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Immediately
prior to the Merger, the Company owned greater than 95 of the outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis of Nexcella, par value
 0.0001 per share (the Nexcella Shares ), and 100 of the outstanding shares of each other class of capital stock of Nexcella.
Under the DGCL, the only approval required was that of the Company s Board of Directors for the Merger to become effective. As
a result of the Merger, Nexcella ceased to exist and all assets, operations and other property and rights of Nexcella have been succeeded
to by the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Merger, as a result of the Merger, each of the outstanding Nexcella Shares
(other than Nexcella Shares held by the Company) were converted, into common stock of the Company Company Merger Shares ).
In connection with the Merger, the Company issued 989,876 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Nexcella (other than
shares held by the Company) (including Company common stock issued to third-party cash investors in Nexcella) (the Merger Shares ).
In addition, the Company issued to the former participants in the Nexcella 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, 275,759 restricted stock awards
to receive common stock in the Company and options to purchase up to 595,676 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of 2.47
per share (the closing price on May 17, 2024), under the Company s Amended and Restated 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. 

Research
and License Agreement with Hadasit and BIRAD 

On
December 8, 2022, our subsidiary Nexcella entered into a Research and License Agreement (the Agreement with Hadasit Medical

Net
Loss 

Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16,886,309 compared to 10,440,156 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
which increase was due primarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, each as
discussed in greater detail above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of research and development expenditures and various general and administrative
expenses. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in
our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are
unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors,
including, but not limited to: 

the
 scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, pre-clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product
 candidates; 

the
 costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for regulatory approval and commercialization; 

the
 extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our
 product candidates; 

the
 costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending
 intellectual property-related claims; 

the
 costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 

expenses
 needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

the
 costs associated with being a public company; 

the
 costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities; 

the
 costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities,
 for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; and 

revenue,
 if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 16.2 million of working capital. 

On
July 25, 2024, the Company was awarded an 8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to support
the clinical development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL
Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones that are primarily based on patient enrollment in
the Company s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has not complied
with the terms and conditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds received under this grant may
only be used for allowable project costs specifically identified with the CIRM-funded project. Such costs can include, but are not
limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study costs. Under the terms of the grant,
both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company s co-funding requirement is
predetermined as a part of the award. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects to begin receiving funds
from the grant beginning in November of 2024. 

31 

We
believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need additional funds depending on our operational
needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development expenditures, and general and administrative
expenses. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity
offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity
or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, which dilution may be significant, and the terms of these securities
may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. If we raise additional funds
through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish
valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that
may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed,
we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant
rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

Cash
used in operating activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 13,118,904 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 8,694,001 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to our net
loss of 16,886,309, offset by non-cash items of stock-based compensation expense of 2,314,920, depreciation expense of 12,338 and
right of use asset amortization of 61,713. Operating activities also included an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of
 2,120,531, an increase in the tax receivable of 746,748, and an increase in prepaid expenses of 7,932. Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to our net loss of 10,440,156, offset by non-cash items
of stock-based compensation expense of 1,514,900 and depreciation expense of 2,392. Operating activities also included an increase
in accounts payable of 1,580,248, an increase in the tax receivable of 427,476 and an increase in prepaid expenses of 923,909. 

Cash
used in investing activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 670,529 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting solely of purchase of
property and operating equipment, compared to 38,912 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
provided by financing activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 15,948,567 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 14,876,820 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2024 was related to proceeds of 15,946,078 from the sale of common
shares through a public offering. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2023 was related to proceeds of 5,002,284 from the sale
of common shares through the at-the-market offerings, proceeds of 9,934,153 from the sale of common shares and pre-funded warrants in
a private placement offering, and proceeds of 175,000 from the sale of common shares of our former majority-owned (now wholly-owned)
subsidiary, Nexcella, offset by payments of deferred offering costs of 234,617. 

Our
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment
of profitable operations. As of September 30, 2024, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of 70,212,617 and have not yet generated
any revenue from operations. Management anticipates that our cash on hand and funds that may be raised pursuant to the July Sales Agreement
and 8 million grant from CIRM will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least 12 months from the filing date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. 

32 

We
will have additional capital requirements going forward and may need to seek additional financing, which may or may not be available
to us on acceptable terms, if at all. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides
that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of
the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii) complying with the requirement adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on financial statements.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total
annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of
the completion of our initial public offering (December 31, 2026); (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible
debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the
SEC. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management regularly evaluates
its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, long-lived assets valuation, variable
interest entities, and legal matters. Actual results may differ from these estimates which may be material. Note 2 Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2022 Form 10-K ),
and Critical Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies
and methods used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company s
critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a smaller reporting company, as defined in
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

33 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024,
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer has concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below. 

Material
Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

We
identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined
that we had a material weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel, we did not have in place an effective
internal control environment with formal processes and procedures, including adequate segregation of duties within account processes
and systems, and journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting transactions that would identify errors
in a timely manner. Based on our assessment, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the material weakness still exists. 

Notwithstanding
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness 

We
are committed to continually improving our internal controls over financial reporting. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, we appointed
a new vice president of finance and accounting and director of corporate strategy, as part of our program to develop and implement effective
internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, management is currently working on the plan to address the material weaknesses
noted above. 

The
material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period and management
has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal
control over financial reporting, we may decide that additional measures are necessary to address these identified control deficiencies. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

Other
than the remediation actions noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Risk
factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 Annual Report as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and below. There
have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report, except as set forth below. You
should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report and below, which could materially affect our business, financial condition
or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or
operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively
affected. 

Economic
uncertainty may affect our access to capital and/or increase the costs of such capital. 

Global
economic conditions continue to be volatile and uncertain due to, among other things, consumer confidence in future economic conditions,
fears of recession and trade wars, the price of energy, fluctuating interest rates, the availability and cost of consumer credit, the
availability and timing of government stimulus programs, levels of unemployment, increased inflation, tax rates, and the war between
Ukraine and Russia which began in February 2022, and Israel and Hamas, which began in October 2023 and which threatens to spread to other
Middle Eastern countries. These conditions remain unpredictable and create uncertainties about our ability to raise capital in the future.
In the event required capital becomes unavailable in the future, or more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
future results of operations, and financial condition. 

Our
outstanding options and warrants may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had (i) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,010,988 shares of common stock at a weighted
average exercise price of 2.03 per share; (ii) outstanding Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares of common stock with an
exercise price of 0.0001; and (iii) outstanding warrants to purchase 397,500 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise
price of 4.11 per share (when not including the Pre-Funded warrants). For the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the
opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares
upon the exercise of outstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. 

The
availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price
of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options
or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may
have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued
in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to
decline. 

In
addition, the common stock issuable upon exercise/conversion of outstanding convertible securities may represent overhang that may also
adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company s stock in the
market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders
attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb shares
sold by holders of our outstanding convertible securities, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease. 

35 

A
significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock. 

Sales
of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our
common stock is available for resale in the public market, including (a) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 4,010,988
shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 2.03 per share; (b) Pre-Funded warrants to purchase 1,913,661 shares
of common stock with an exercise price of 0.0001; and (c) 3,241,076 shares of common stock, the resale of which has been registered
under the Securities Act. We have also filed certain Form S-8 Registration Statements pursuant to which we can issue unregistered stock
in connection with awards under our equity plans. If a significant number of shares were sold, such sales would increase the supply of
our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its price. Some or all of our shares of common stock, including those discussed
above, may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration statements and/or compliance with Company
insider trading policy, Exchange Act Section 16 and/or Rule 144, which sales could have a depressive effect on the market for our shares
of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally sell
common stock into the market. The sale of a significant portion of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause
the value of our common stock to decline in value. 

We
may not receive the 8 million which we recently learned was granted to us by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. 

On
July 25, 2024, the Company learned that it was awarded an 8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine
(CIRM) to support the clinical development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy NXC-201 for the treatment of
relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis. The award is payable to the Company upon achievement of milestones that are primarily based on
patient enrollment in the Company s clinical trials. Additionally, if CIRM determines, in its sole discretion, that the
Company has not complied with the terms and conditions of the grant, CIRM may suspend or permanently cease disbursements. Funds
received under this grant may only be used for allowable project costs specifically identified with the CIRM-funded project. Such
costs can include, but are not limited to, salary for personnel, itemized supplies, consultants, and itemized clinical study costs.
Under the terms of the grant, both CIRM and the Company will co-fund the research project and the amount of the Company s
co-funding requirement is predetermined as a part of the award. The Company signed the grant agreement in November 2024 and expects
to begin receiving funds from the grant beginning in November of 2024. The Company has not yet received any funds in connection with
such award and may not receive funds on a timely basis, or at all, and such award may come with conditions. The Company is required
to complete certain requirements and agree to certain terms and conditions in connection with such grant, which have not been
completed or agreed to as of the date of this Report. In the event the award was not received on a timely basis, or at all, or
subject to conditions, the Company could be forced to seek out alternative funding which may not be on as favorable terms as such
currently expected grant. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 19,737 shares of restricted common stock valued at 37,500 for investor
relations services based on the closing price on the date of the agreement pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on
September 20, 2024. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 31,641 shares of restricted common stock valued at 67,500 for investor
relations services based on the average closing price for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered
into on July 25, 2023. 

Subsequent
to September 30, 2024, the Company issued 27,062 shares of restricted common stock valued at 45,000 for investor relations services
based on the average closing price for the prior 10 trading days pursuant to a marketing services agreement entered into on July 25,
2023. 

The
issuances described above were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities
Act, since the foregoing issuances did not involve a public offering, the recipient took the securities for investment and not resale,
we took take appropriate measures to restrict transfer, and the recipient was (a) an accredited investor and/or
(b) had access to similar documentation and information as would be required in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act. The
securities are subject to transfer restrictions, and the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities have not
been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The
securities were not registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration
or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.
