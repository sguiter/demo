 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, that reflect future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements depend upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside of our control. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intends, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. 
 Our projections, including for revenues, market share, expenses and profitability, are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties. You are cautioned that our business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and, consequently, our actual results may differ materially from those projected. 
 Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 competition in the online casino, online sports betting and retail sports betting (i.e., such as within a bricks-and-mortar casino) industries is intense and, as a result, we may fail to attract and/or retain customers, which may negatively impact our operations, growth prospects and financial condition; 
 economic downturns, such as recessions, inflation, and political and market conditions beyond our control, including a reduction in consumer discretionary spending and sports leagues shortening, delaying or cancelling parts of their seasons or certain events due to external factors such as pandemics or international conflicts, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; 
 our growth prospects may suffer if we are unable to develop or maintain competitive offerings, if we fail to pursue additional offerings, if we lose any of our executives or other key employees or if we are unable to scale and support our information technology and other systems and platforms to meet the Company s needs; 
 our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws (including the laws of Canada, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, where we have business operations), many of which are unsettled and still developing, and our growth prospects depend on the legal status of real-money gaming in various jurisdictions; 
 failure to comply with regulatory requirements or, as necessary or appropriate, successfully obtain a license or permit applied for could adversely impact our ability to comply with licensing and regulatory requirements or to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions, or could cause financial institutions, online platforms, vendors and distributors to stop providing services to us; 
 we rely on information technology and other systems and platforms (including reliance on third-party providers to validate the identity and location of our customers and to process customer deposits and withdrawals), and any breach or disruption of such systems or platforms could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, disclosed, lost, corrupted or stolen; 
 we have a history of losses (calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States) and may continue to incur losses in the future; 
 certain of our officers and directors may allocate their time to other businesses and potentially have conflicts of interest with our business; 
 we license certain trademarks and domain names from Rush Street Gaming, LLC RSG and its affiliates, and RSG s and its affiliates use of such trademarks and domain names, or failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; 
 we currently, and will likely continue to, rely on licenses and service agreements to use the intellectual property rights and technology of related or third parties that are incorporated into or used in our products and services; 
 the timing, amount, duration and utilization of the Stock Repurchase Program (as defined below); and 
 i 

Table of Contents 

 other factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our most recently completed fiscal year, including the Business , Risk Factors, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk sections, as well as described in our other filings with the SEC, such as this Report, our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. 
 Due to the uncertain nature of these factors, management cannot assess the impact of each factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Report, unless required by law. New factors may emerge, and it is not possible to predict all factors that may affect our business and prospects. 
 Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data 
 The numbers for our key metrics, which include our monthly active users MAUs and average revenue per MAU ARPMAU ), are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base and activity levels for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our offerings across large online and mobile populations based in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we continuously seek to improve our estimates of our user base and user activity, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. 
 We regularly evaluate these metrics to estimate the number of duplicate accounts among our MAUs and remove the effects of such duplicate accounts on our key metrics. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. Generally, duplicate accounts arise as a result of users signing up to use more than one of our brands (i.e., BetRivers, PlaySugarHouse and RushBet) or to use our offerings in more than one jurisdiction, for instance when a user lives in New Jersey but works in New York. The estimates of duplicate accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as similar IP addresses or usernames. Our estimates may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, which may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate accounts are very difficult to measure, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate accounts may vary significantly from our estimates. 
 Our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics. We believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated. In addition, our key metrics and related information and estimates, including the definitions and calculations of the same, may differ from those published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in operations, offerings, methodology and access to information.

 The Company recognized federal, state and foreign income tax expense of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to million and million during the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were and , respectively, and were ) and ) during the same periods in 2023. The difference between the Company s effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 was primarily due to a full valuation allowance recorded on the Company s net U.S. deferred tax assets, non-taxable income / (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest and income tax rate differences related to the Company s Colombia operations for which both current and deferred taxes were recorded. The Company evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. 
 In connection with the Business Combination, the Special Limited Partner entered into the TRA, which generally provides that it pay of certain net tax benefits, if any, that the Company (including the Special Limited Partner) realizes (or in certain cases is deemed to realize) as a result of an increase in tax basis and tax benefits related to the transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement and the exchange of Retained RSILP Units (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) for Class A Common Stock (or cash at the Company s option) pursuant to RSILP s amended and restated limited partnership agreement and tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. These payments are the obligation of the Special Limited Partner and not of RSILP. The actual increase in the Special Limited Partner s allocable share of RSILP s tax basis in its assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A Common Stock at the time of the exchange and the amount and timing of the recognition of RSI and its consolidated subsidiaries (including the Special Limited Partner s) income. 
 Based primarily on historical losses of RSILP, management has determined it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be unable to utilize its deferred tax assets subject to the TRA; therefore, management applies a full valuation allowance to deferred tax asset or a corresponding liability under the TRA related to the tax savings the Company may realize from the utilization of tax deductions related to basis adjustments created by the transactions in the Business Combination Agreement. The unrecognized TRA liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The increase in the liability is primarily due to the issuance of Class A Common Stock upon RSILP Unit exchanges. Due to the fact that the Company's deferred tax assets and corresponding TRA liability are unrecognized, this increase had no impact on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Net royalties paid are recorded as costs of revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 In certain cases, the affiliate casino maintains the bank account that processes cash deposits and withdrawals for the Company s customers. Accordingly, at any point in time, the Company will record a receivable from the affiliate, representing the Company s total gaming revenue (with customers) that was collected by the affiliate, less consideration payable to the affiliate for use of its license, which is offset by any consideration owed to the Company from the affiliate based on the terms of the applicable agreement. Receivables due from affiliated land-based casinos were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 In addition, the Company provides retail sports services to certain affiliated land-based casinos in exchange for a monthly commission based on the casino s retail sportsbook revenue. Services generally include ongoing management and oversight of the retail sportsbook, technical support for the casino s customers, risk management, advertising and promotion, and support for third-party vendors sports betting equipment. Revenue recognized relating to retail sports services provided to affiliated land-based casinos for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Any payables due to the affiliated land-based casinos are netted against affiliate receivables to the extent a right of offset exists.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our Annual Report ), and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report ). In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under the sections of this Report captioned Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. For a discussion of limitations in measuring certain of our key metrics, see the section of this Report captioned Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data. 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains certain financial measures, in particular the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, which are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ). We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they provide us and readers of this Report with additional insight into our operational performance relative to earlier periods and relative to our competitors. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for any GAAP financial information. Readers of this Report should use these non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, are provided in this Report. 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Report to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Rush Street Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Our Business 
 We are a leading online gaming and entertainment company that focuses primarily on online casino and online sports betting in the U.S., Canadian and Latin American markets. Our mission is to engage and delight players by delivering friendly, fun and fair betting experiences. In furtherance of this mission, we strive to create an online community for our customers where we are transparent and honest, treat our customers fairly, show them that we value their time and loyalty, and listen to feedback. We also endeavor to implement industry leading responsible gaming practices and provide our customers with a cutting-edge online gaming platform and exciting, personalized offerings that will enhance their user experience. 
 We provide our customers with an array of leading gaming offerings such as real-money online casino, online sports betting and retail sports betting (i.e., sports betting services provided at bricks-and-mortar locations), as well as social gaming, which involves free-to-play games using virtual credits that users can earn or purchase. We launched our first social gaming website in 2015 and began accepting real-money bets in the United States in 2016. Currently, we offer real-money online casino, online sports betting and/or retail sports betting in 15 U.S. states and the four international markets as outlined in the table below.

 Our real-money online casino and online sports betting offerings are currently provided under our BetRivers and PlaySugarHouse brands in the United States and Canada and under our RushBet brand in Latin America (which includes Mexico). We operate and/or support retail sports betting for our bricks-and-mortar partners under our brands or our partners respective brands depending on the terms of our arrangement. Many of our social gaming offerings are marketed under our own brands, although we also offer social gaming under our partners brands as well. Our decision about what brand or brands to use is market and/or partner specific, and is based on brand awareness, market research, marketing efficiency, contractual obligations and applicable gaming rules and regulations. 
 
 Trends in Key Metrics 
 Monthly Active Users 
 MAUs is the number of unique users per month who have placed at least one real-money bet across one or more of our online casino or online sports betting offerings. We average the MAUs for the months in the relevant period. We exclude users who have made a deposit but have not yet placed a real-money bet on at least one of our online offerings. We also exclude users who have placed a real-money bet but only with promotional incentives. 
 MAUs is a key indicator of the scale of our user base and awareness of our brands. We believe that year-over-year MAUs is also generally indicative of the long-term revenue growth potential of our business, although MAUs in individual periods may be less indicative of our longer-term expectations. We expect the number of MAUs to grow as we attract, retain and re-engage users in new and existing jurisdictions and expand our offerings to appeal to a wider audience.

Table of Contents 

 The chart below presents our average MAUs in the United States and Canada for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 The increase in MAUs in the United States and Canada was mainly due to our continued growth and strong customer retention rates in existing markets and expansion into new markets such as Delaware, which was partially offset by our exit from the Connecticut market. Additionally, we continue to achieve a positive response from our strategic advertising and marketing efforts. 
 The chart below presents our average MAUs in Latin America (including Mexico) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 The increase in MAUs in Latin America was mainly due to our continued growth and strong customer retention rates in Colombia and Mexico. Additionally, we continue to achieve a positive response from our strategic advertising and marketing efforts.

Average Revenue Per Monthly Active User 
 ARPMAU for an applicable period is monthly revenue divided by average MAUs. This key metric represents our ability to drive usage and monetization of our online offerings. 
 The chart below presents our ARPMAU in the United States and Canada for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 The year-over-year increase in ARPMAU in the United States and Canada was mainly due to our continued growth in markets that launched during 2023 where we offer online casino in addition to online sports betting, such as Delaware, the impact of our strategic advertising and marketing efforts in other markets where offer online casino and our focus on retaining quality players.

 Non-GAAP Information 
 This Report includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP performance measure that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as it is similar to measures reported by our public competitors and is regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any GAAP financial measures and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest income or expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, adjustments for certain one-time or non-recurring items and other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required in accordance with GAAP because certain expenses are either non-cash (i.e., depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation) or are not related to our underlying business performance (i.e., interest income or expense). 
 We include Adjusted EBITDA because management uses it to evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the distribution of capital and new investments. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on our past financial and operating performance, enables comparison of financial results from period-to-period where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in operating our business. Management also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

 Key Components of Revenue and Expenses 
 Revenue 
 We currently offer real-money online casino, online sports betting and/or retail sports betting in 15 U.S. states, Colombia, Mexico, Ontario, Canada and Peru. We also provide social gaming (where permitted), where users can earn or purchase virtual credits to enjoy free-to-play games. 
 Our revenue is predominantly generated from our U.S. and Canada operations, with the remaining revenue being generated from our Latin America (including Mexico) operations. We generate revenue primarily through the following offerings: 
 Online Casino 
 Online casino offerings typically include the full suite of games available in bricks-and-mortar casinos, such as table games (i.e., blackjack and roulette) and slot machines. For these offerings, similar to bricks-and-mortar casinos, we generate revenue through hold, or gross winnings, as customers play against the house. Like bricks-and-mortar casinos, there is volatility with online casino, but as the number of bets placed increases, the net revenue retained from bets placed becomes easier to predict. Our experience has been that online casino revenue is less volatile than sports betting revenue. 
 Our online casino offering consists of a combination of licensed content from leading industry suppliers, customized third-party games and a small number of proprietary games that were developed in-house or at our direction exclusively for us. Third-party content is usually subject to standard revenue-sharing agreements specific to each supplier, where the supplier generally receives a percentage of the net gaming revenue generated from its casino games played on our platform. In exchange, we receive a limited license to offer the games on our platform to customers in permitted jurisdictions. We generally pay much lower fees on revenue generated through our proprietary casino games such as our multi-bet blackjack (with side bets: 21+3, Lucky Ladies, Lucky Lucky) and single-deck blackjack, which primarily relate to hosting/remote gaming server fees and certain intellectual property license fees. 
 Online casino revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the changes in unsettled bets and the progressive jackpot reserve. 
 Online Sports Betting 
 Online sports betting involves a user placing a bet on the outcome of a sporting event, a sports-related activity or a series of the same, with the chance to win a pre-determined amount, often referred to as fixed odds. Online sports betting revenue is generated by setting odds such that there is a built-in theoretical margin in each sports bet offered to customers. While sporting event outcomes may result in revenue volatility, we believe that we can achieve a positive long-term betting win margin. In addition to traditional fixed-odds betting, we also offer other fixed-odd sports betting products including in-game betting and multi-sport and same-game parlay betting. We have also incorporated live streaming of certain sporting events into our online sports betting offering. 
 Integrated into our online sports betting platform is a third-party risk and trading platform currently provided by Kambi Group plc and its subsidiaries.

Table of Contents 

 Online sports revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the change in unsettled sports bets. 
 Retail Sports Betting 
 We provide retail sports betting services to certain land-based partners in exchange for a monthly commission that is calculated based on the land-based retail sportsbook revenue. Services generally include ongoing management and oversight of the retail sportsbook (i.e., within a bricks-and-mortar location), technical support for such partner s customers, risk management, advertising and promotion, and support for third-party sports betting equipment. 
 In addition, certain relationships with our partners provide us the ability to operate the retail sportsbook at the land-based partner s facility. In this scenario, revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less other incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the changes in unsettled retail sports bets and unclaimed retail tickets for settled retail bets. 
 Social Gaming 
 We provide social gaming (where permitted) where users can earn or purchase virtual credits to enjoy free-to-play games. Users who exhaust their credits can either purchase additional virtual credits from the virtual cashier or wait until their virtual credits are replenished for free. Virtual credits have no monetary value and can only be used within our social gaming platform. 
 Our social gaming business has three main goals: build online databases in key markets ahead of and post-legalization and regulation; generate revenues; and increase engagement and visitation to our bricks-and-mortar partner properties. Our social gaming products are a marketing tool that keeps the applicable brands present in the minds of our users and engages with users through another channel while providing the entertainment value that users seek. We also leverage our social gaming products to cross-sell to our real-money offerings in jurisdictions where real-money gaming is authorized. 
 We recognize deferred revenue when users purchase virtual credits and revenue when those credits are redeemed. We pay a percentage of the social gaming revenue derived from the sale and redemption of the virtual credits to content suppliers as well as to our land-based partners. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Costs of Revenue. Costs of revenue consist primarily of (i) revenue share and market access fees, (ii) platform and content fees, (iii) gaming taxes, (iv) payment processing fees and chargebacks and (v) salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation for dedicated personnel. Other than salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation, these costs are primarily variable in nature and should typically correlate with the change in revenue. Revenue share and market access fees consist primarily of amounts paid to local partners that hold the applicable gaming license, providing us the ability to offer our real-money online offerings in the respective jurisdictions. Our platform and content fees are primarily driven by costs associated with third-party casino content, data and streaming, sports betting trading services and certain elements of our platform technology, such as geolocation and know-your-customer. Gaming taxes relate to state taxes that are determined on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, or federal excise taxes that are determined based on a percentage of the total online sports and retail sports bets placed. We incur payment processing costs on customer deposits, withdrawals and occasionally chargebacks (i.e., when a payment processor contractually disallows customer deposits in the normal course of business). 
 Advertising and Promotions Costs. Advertising and promotions costs consist primarily of costs associated with marketing our offerings via different channels, promotional activities and related customer acquisition costs. These costs also include salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation for dedicated personnel and are expensed as incurred. 
 Our ability to effectively market is critical to our success. Using experience, dynamic learnings and analytics, we leverage marketing to acquire, convert, retain and re-engage customers. We use a variety of earned media and paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers, brand ambassadors, proprietary content, and unique game and site features, to attract and engage customers. Further, we continuously optimize our marketing spend using data collected from our operations. Our marketing spend is based on a return-on-investment model that considers a variety of factors, including the product offerings in the jurisdiction, local advertising rules, the performance of different marketing channels, predicted lifetime value, marginal costs and expenses and behavior of customers across various product offerings. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 With respect to paid marketing, we use a broad array of advertising channels, including television, radio, social media platforms, sponsorships and ambassadorships, affiliates and paid search, and other digital channels. We also use other forms of marketing and outreach, such as our social media channels, first-party websites, media interviews and other media spots and organic searches. These efforts are primarily concentrated within the specific jurisdictions where we operate or intend to operate. We believe there is a significant benefit in maintaining the flexibility to reallocate advertising spending across channels based on the latest marketing data, ensuring continuous alignment with our overall marketing strategy. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits, share-based compensation expense for dedicated personnel, professional fees related to legal, compliance, audit and consulting services, software, rent and insurance costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets (including market access licenses, gaming jurisdictional licenses, internally developed software, trademarks, developed technology, media content and customer lists) and finance lease right-of-use assets over their useful lives. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following tables set forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the interim periods indicated and the changes between periods. We have derived this data from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.

 Revenue. Revenue increased by 62.2 million, or 37 , to 232.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 169.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to and directly correlated with our continued growth across existing markets and expansion into the new market of Delaware, which launched after September 30, 2023. The increase reflects higher period-over-period online casino and sports betting revenue of 64.9 million. This was partly offset by a decrease in retail sports betting revenue of 2.7 million, which was attributable to the Company s exit from the Connecticut market. 
 Costs of Revenue. Costs of revenue increased by 35.3 million, or 30 , to 151.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 116.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to and directly correlated with our expansion and continued growth as noted above. Market access costs, gaming taxes, operating expenses, and payment processing costs contributed 17.0 million, 9.9 million, 4.5 million and 3.2 million, respectively, to the period-over-period increase in costs of revenue. Personnel costs contributed to the remainder of the period-over-period increase. Costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 65 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 68 for the same period in 2023. 
 Advertising and Promotions. Advertising and promotions expense increased by 4.6 million, or 13 , to 39.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 34.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to additional marketing spend on two major sporting events that occurred during the quarter (i.e., COPA 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 America and the Olympics). Advertising and promotions expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 17 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 20 for the same period in 2023. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased by 4.1 million, or 18 , to 26.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 22.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other administrative costs, which is consistent with the ongoing growth of our business. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 13 for the same period in 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 0.1 million, or 1 , to 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to the amortization of other intangibles acquired during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5 for the same period in 2023. 
 Interest Income, Net. Interest income increased by 1.3 million, or 169 , to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in interest income was mainly attributed to higher amounts of cash held in interest-bearing accounts and money market funds as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense increased by 2.8 million, or 117 , to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.4 million for the same period in 2023. Income tax expense is attributable to the profitability of our foreign operations for which both current and deferred taxes are recorded. Income tax expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1 for the same period in 2023.

 Revenue. Revenue increased by 172.6 million, or 35 , to 669.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 497.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to and directly correlated with our continued growth across existing markets and expansion into new market of Delaware, which launched after September 30, 2023. The increase reflects higher period-over-period online casino and sports betting revenue of 180.9 million and social gaming revenue of 0.1 million, which was partially offset by a decrease of retail sports betting revenue of 8.4 million due to the Company s exit from the Connecticut market. 
 Costs of Revenue. Costs of revenue increased by 107.2 million, or 32 , to 440.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 333.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to and directly correlated with, our expansion and continued growth as noted above. Market access costs, gaming taxes, operating expenses, payment processing costs, and personnel costs contributed 45.6 million, 34.0 million, 16.6 million, 9.0 million and 2.0 million, respectively, to the period-over-period increase in costs of revenue. Costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 67 for the same period in 2023.

 Advertising and Promotions. Advertising and promotions expense decreased by 10.9 million, or 9 , to 114.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 125.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to management s strategy of rationalizing marketing spend as the North American and Latin American online gaming industries continue to mature. Advertising and promotions expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25 for the same period in 2023. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased by 15.0 million, or 23 , to 79.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 64.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other administrative costs, which is consistent with the ongoing growth of our business. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 12 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 13 for the same period in 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.0 million, or 4 , to 23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 22.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to additional costs to acquire internally developed software and other definite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4 for the same period in 2023. 
 Interest Income, Net. Interest income increased by 4.1 million, or 286 , to 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in interest income was mainly attributed to higher amounts of cash held in interest-bearing accounts and money market funds as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense increased by 9.0 million, or 114 , to 17.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.9 million for the same period in 2023. Income tax expense is attributable to the profitability of our foreign operations for which both current and deferred taxes are recorded. Income tax expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Seasonality and Other Trends Impacting Our Business 
 Our results of operations may, and generally do, fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors such as level of customer engagement, online casino and sports betting results and other factors that are outside of our control or that we cannot reasonably predict. Our quarterly financial performance depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Customer engagement in our online offerings may vary due to, among other things, customer satisfaction with our platform, the number, timing and type of sporting events, the length of professional sports seasons, our offerings and marketing efforts and those of our competitors (including those not just in the online gaming industry but also in the entertainment industry more broadly), weather conditions, public sentiment, an economic downturn or other economic factors such as inflation, economic uncertainty or macroeconomic conditions. As customer engagement varies, so may our quarterly financial performance. 
 Our quarterly financial results may also be impacted by the number and amount of betting losses and jackpot payouts we experience. Although our losses are limited per wager to a maximum payout, when looking at bets across a period of time, these losses can be significant. We offer progressive jackpot games in certain of our online casino offerings. Each time a customer plays a progressive jackpot game, we contribute a portion of the amount bet to the jackpot for that game or group of games. When a progressive jackpot is won, it is paid out and reset to a predetermined base amount. Winning the jackpot is determined by a random mechanism; we cannot foresee when a jackpot will be won, and we do not insure against jackpot payouts. Paying the progressive jackpot decreases our cash position. 
 Our online sports betting and retail sports betting operations experience seasonality based on the relative popularity and frequency of certain sporting events. Although sporting events occur throughout the year, our online sports betting customers are most active during the NFL, NBA, and college football and basketball seasons. With respect to our online sports betting and retail sports betting operations, customer activity tends to increase, and we may experience increased volatility, in connection with major sporting events such as the NFL super bowl, the NBA finals and NCAA basketball March Madness. In addition, sports betting activity is impacted by the occurrence of periodic events (e.g., COPA America, UEFA, Olympics). 
 From a legislative perspective, we continue to see momentum to legalize and regulate online sports betting in new jurisdictions in the Americas. As expected, many of these new jurisdictions are first trying to legalize and regulate online sports betting before considering whether to legalize and regulate online casino. However, given the tax generation success 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 of online casino in markets where it has been legalized, we also continue to see momentum for online casino in several jurisdictions in the Americas that are looking for additional revenue sources to fund governmental budgets. Additionally, we have seen governmental officials or legislative or regulatory bodies in certain jurisdictions in which we operate consider, and in limited cases to date, approve, increases in gaming-related taxes or other types of taxes on companies operating in the gaming industry. While it is unclear at this time if this will continue, any proposed legislation or other similar actions to increase existing taxes on online sportsbook and/or casino could negatively impact our business, profitability and cash flows. 
 We operate within the global gaming and entertainment industry, which is comprised of diverse products and offerings that compete for consumers time and disposable income. We face and expect to continue to face significant competition from other industry players both within existing and new markets including from competitors with access to more resources, existing assets such as brands or databases, or experience. Customer demands for new and innovative offerings and features require us to continue to invest in new technologies, features and content to improve the customer experience. Many jurisdictions in which we operate or intend to operate in the future have unique regulatory and/or technological requirements, which require us to have robust, scalable networks and infrastructure, and agile engineering and software development capabilities. The global gaming and entertainment industry has seen significant consolidation, regulatory change and technological development over the last few years, and we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future, which may create opportunities for us but may also create competitive and margin pressures. We are starting to see some other online gaming operators rationalize their marketing spend in North American jurisdictions, although their marketing spend may vary by quarter depending on, among other things, sports calendars, new market launches and prior commitments. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital and capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations. Our current working capital needs relate mainly to supporting our existing businesses, the growth of these businesses in their existing markets and their expansion into other geographic regions, as well as our personnel s compensation and benefits. 
 We had 216.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 (excluding legally restricted customer cash deposits, which we segregate from our operating cash balances). We intend to continue to finance our operations without third-party debt and entirely from operating cash flows and cash on our balance sheet. 
 In connection with the Business Combination, we executed the TRA, which generally provides that the Special Limited Partner pay an amount equal to 85 of certain net tax benefits, if any, that the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Special Limited Partner, realize (or in certain cases is deemed to realize) as a result of the increases in tax basis and tax benefits related to the transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement and the exchange of certain common units in RSILP retained by the Sellers for Class A Common Stock (or cash) and tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments made under the TRA will vary, such payments may be significant. Any payments made under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us and, to the extent that payments required under the TRA are unable to be made for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. To date, no material payments under the TRA have been made, and no material payments or accrued payments thereunder are expected in the near future as payments under the TRA are not owed until the tax benefits generated thereunder are more-likely-than-not to be realized. 
 We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. It is possible that we may need additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments, including unanticipated regulatory developments, significant acquisitions, partnerships or marketing initiatives, expansions in new or existing markets, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and competitive pressures. We expect our capital expenditures and working capital requirements to continue to increase in the immediate future to support our growth as we seek to expand our offerings across more of North America, Latin America and worldwide, which will require significant investment in our online gaming platform and our personnel, in particular in product development, engineering and operations roles. We also expect certain costs such as marketing, market access and license fees to increase as we continue to pursue expansion opportunities in new and existing jurisdictions. In particular, we are party to several non-cancelable contracts with vendors and licensors for marketing and other strategic partnerships, pursuant to which we are obligated to make future minimum payments under the non-cancelable terms of these contracts. To the extent that our current resources 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing. If the needed financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable than we expect, we may be forced to decrease our level of investment in new product, service or market launches and related marketing initiatives or to scale back our existing operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial prospects. 
 We expect our material cash requirements during the upcoming 12-month period to include 6.7 million of non-cancellable purchase obligations with marketing vendors, 3.0 million of license and market access fees, and 2.6 million of lease payments. In addition, we will continue to pursue expansion into new markets, which is expected to require significant capital investments. We have 43.5 million of additional non-cancellable purchase obligations including arrangements with marketing vendors, obligations for license and market access fees, and lease payments subsequent to the upcoming 12-month period. See Note 12 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Management believes our current cash holdings and, if necessary or desirable, various avenues available to pursue funding in the capital markets will suffice to fund these obligations. 
 Surety Bonds 
 We had been issued 31.2 million and 28.0 million in surety bonds as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, that are used to satisfy regulatory requirements related to securing cash held for the benefit of customers. 
 We had been issued 6.3 million and 4.6 million in surety bonds as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to satisfy regulatory requirements necessary to operate in certain jurisdictions. 
 There have been no claims against any of our surety bonds and the likelihood of future claims is expected to be remote. 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding debt. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an outstanding letter of credit for 4.6 million and 3.1 million , respectively, in connection with our operations in Colombia, for which no amounts had been drawn. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On October 24, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of up to 50 million of our Class A Common Stock through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table shows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 80,553 (6,759) Net cash used in investing activities (26,215) (26,054) Net cash used in financing activities (682) (375) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (4,274) 3,276 Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 49,382 (29,912) 
 Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 80.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.8 million used in operating activities during the same period in 2023. The increased provision of cash reflects a higher period-over-period net income totaling 55.3 million, increased non-cash expenses of 4.7 million and an increase of 27.2 million due to the change in working capital. The increase in non-cash expenses was driven primarily by additional share-based compensation expense totaling 4.0 million, depreciation and amortization totaling 1.0 million, deferred income taxes of 0.2 million, and noncash lease expense of 0.2 million, which was partially offset by fewer write-offs of long-lived assets of 0.7 million. 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 Investing activities . Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.2 million to 26.2 million, as compared to 26.0 million during the same period in 2023. The increase reflects higher short-term investment of 1.9 million, internally developed software costs totaling 1.2 million, and acquisition of other intangibles totaling 1.1 million. This was partially offset by lower period-over-period cash paid for acquisition of gaming licenses totaling 3.2 million, investment in equity totaling 0.5 million, and purchases of property and equipment totaling 0.3 million. 
 Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.3 million to 0.7 million, as compared to 0.4 million during the same period in 2023. The period-over-period primarily reflects higher principal payments of finance lease liabilities. 
 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The effect of exchange rate changes decreased cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash by 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an increase of 3.3 million for the same period in 2023. These changes were due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have prepared our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board. 
 There were no material changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, to the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Annual Report. For a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our Annual Report. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Accounting Election 
 Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. As of the date of this Report, we are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions for emerging growth companies because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We operate primarily in the United States, Canada and Latin America. As such, we have been exposed in the past and may in the future be exposed to certain market risks, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange and inflation risks, in the ordinary course of our business. Currently, these risks are not material to our financial condition or results of operations, but they may be in the future. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 220.4 million, which consisted primarily of bank deposits, certificates of deposits and money market funds. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments, historical fluctuations of interest income have not been significant. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity without significantly increasing risk. A 10 increase or decrease in the interest rates of these interest-earning instruments would not have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our transactions in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, which is our reporting and functional currency for a majority of our operations. We seek to naturally hedge our foreign exchange transaction exposure by matching the transaction currencies for our cash inflows and outflows. Currently, we do not otherwise hedge our foreign exchange exposure but may consider doing so in the future. Our foreign currency exposure is primarily with respect to the Colombian Peso, the Canadian Dollar and the Mexican Peso. Markets with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar accounted for less than 25 and 10 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A 10 increase or decrease in the value of these currencies compared to the U.S. Dollar would not have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our customers may experience inflationary pressures and rising costs. This could result in our customers having less disposable income, and thus they may reduce their spending on discretionary entertainment activities such as our products and services. Such a reduction in spending by our customers could harm our business, financial condition, revenues and operating results. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, as specified above. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time we become involved in legal proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business activities. These proceedings may be at varying stages, and many of these proceedings may seek an indeterminate amount of damages. We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred and to determine if accruals are appropriate. If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss can be made. 
 In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, though the outcomes could be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report.
