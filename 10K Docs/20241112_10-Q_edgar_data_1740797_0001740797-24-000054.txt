our company will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued working capital requirements. 

Going Concern - There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon public
offering and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant
dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will
increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 

Due to the uncertainty of
our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on our audited consolidated financial statements, our
independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our
assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

29 

LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL 

There is no historical financial
information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated
limited revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to
risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to
price and cost increases in services and products. 

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company as defined
by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including
its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

During the past ten years, none of the following occurred
with respect to the President of the Company: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a
general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in
a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being
subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of any competent jurisdiction,
permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting her involvement in any type of business, securities or
banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the commodities futures trading
commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. 

We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings,
and we are not aware of any pending or potential legal actions. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS. 

As a Smaller Reporting Company, the Company is not
required to include the disclosure under this Item 1A. Risk Factors. Despite the fact that we are not required to provide risk factors,
we consider the following factors to be risks to our continued growth and development: 

WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY IN AN EVOLVING
INDUSTRY, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT WE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. 

We have a limited operating history in an evolving
industry that may not develop as expected. Assessing our business and future prospects is challenging in light of the risks and difficulties
we may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to: 

30 

accurately forecast our revenues and plan our operating expenses; 

successfully expand our business; 

assimilate our acquisitions; 

adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways consumers and businesses interact with technology; 

avoid interruptions or disruptions in the offering of our products and our services; 

develop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as well as the deployment of new features and products; 

hire, integrate and retain talented sales, customer service, technology and other personnel; and 

effectively manage rapid growth in personnel and operations; and 

If the demand for our services and/or platforms/products
offered or our products under development are not finalized, our business will be harmed. We may not be able to successfully address these
risks and difficulties, which could harm our business and results of operations. 

OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAKES IT DIFFICULT
FOR US TO EVALUATE OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THOSE ESTIMATES OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. 

We have a limited operating history and, as a
consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our historical data. Reliance on the historical
results may not be representative of the results we will achieve. Because of the uncertainties related to our limited historical operations,
we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues or expenses. If we make poor budgetary
decisions as a result of unreliable historical data, we could be less profitable or continue to incur losses. 

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN
PROFITABILITY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY GOING FORWARD 

The Company does not accrue or capitalize development
costs (or any costs to this effect) and expense it to its profit and loss statements as required by US GAAP. As such, the Company incurred
a net loss of 1,151,889 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and net loss of 2,128,475 for the year ended March 31, 2024. If
we incur additional significant operating losses, our stock price, may decline, perhaps significantly. Our management is developing plans
to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described above. Our business plan is speculative and unproven. There is no assurance
that we will be successful in executing our business plan or that even if we successfully implement our business plan, that we will be
able to curtail our losses now or in the future. Further, as we are an emerging enterprise, we expect that net losses will continue, and
our working capital deficiency will increase. 

WE HAVE NOT GENERATED POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS,
AND OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW IS UNCERTAIN. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW OR OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL
WHEN NEEDED, OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE COULD BE FORCED TO SUSPEND OR DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS. 

Our operations have not generated positive cash flow
for any period since our inception, and we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and short-term and
long-term debt and convertible debt. Our limited operating history makes an evaluation of our future prospects difficult. The actual amount
of funds that we will need to meet our operating needs will be determined by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
These factors include the timing and volume of sales transactions, the success of our marketing strategy, market acceptance of our products,
the success of our manufacturing and research and development efforts (including any unanticipated delays), our manufacturing and labor
costs, the costs associated with obtaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, regulatory changes, competition, technological
developments in the market, evolving industry standards and the amount of working capital investments we are required to make. 

31 

Our ability to continue to operate until we are able
to generate sufficient our cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to generate sufficient positive cash flow from our operations.
If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations, our business and future prospects will be adversely affected and
we could be forced to suspend or discontinue operations. 

The Company had a stockholders deficit of 1,813,466
and an accumulated deficit of 4,128,284 at September 30, 2024. 

WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO SUPPORT BUSINESS
GROWTH, AND THIS CAPITAL MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. 

We intend to continue to make investments to support
our business growth and we will require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features
and products or enhance our existing products, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies.
Further, we need additional capital to continue operations. Accordingly, we need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional
funds. We expect that we have sufficient capital to maintain operations through the year of 2023/4. In order to fully implement our business
plan, we will need to raise about 10,000,000 If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities,
our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and
privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive
covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for
us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional
financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us
when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and
our business may be harmed. 

WE DEPEND UPON KEY PERSONNEL AND NEED ADDITIONAL
PERSONNEL 

Our success depends on our inability to attract and
retain key personnel including our existing personal, and our inability to do so may materially and adversely affect our business operations. The
loss of qualified personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. Additionally, the success of the Company s
operations will largely depend upon its ability to successfully attract and maintain competent and qualified key management personnel.
As with any company with limited resources, there can be no guaranty that the Company will be able to attract such individuals or that
the presence of such individuals will necessarily translate into profitability for the Company. 

OUR BUSINESS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, AND
IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OUR PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL SUFFER AND JEOPARDIZE
OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS 

We require substantial capital to support our operations.
If we are unable to generate adequate cash flows from our operations, maintain adequate financing or other sources of capital are not
available, we could be forced to suspend, curtail or reduce our operations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, financial condition
and business prospects. 

THERE IS CURRENTLY A LIMITED PUBLIC MARKET FOR
OUR COMMON STOCK. FAILURE TO FURTHER DEVELOP OR MAINTAIN A TRADING MARKET COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAKE
IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO SELL YOUR STOCK. 

There is a limited public market for our Common Stock,
which is traded on the OTC QB under the symbol AVAI. We cannot give any assurances that there will ever be a mature, developed market
for our common stock. Failure to further develop or maintain an active trading market could negatively affect the value of our shares
and make it difficult for you to sell your shares or recover any part of your investment in us. Even if a market for our common stock
does develop in a material way, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. In addition to the uncertainties relating
to our future operating performance and the profitability of our operations, factors such as variations in our interim financial results,
or various, as yet unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, may have a negative effect on the market price of our
common stock. 

IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN
AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD. AS A RESULT,
CURRENT AND POTENTIAL STOCKHOLDERS COULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND THE TRADING PRICE
OF OUR STOCK. 

32 

Effective internal controls
are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports
or prevent fraud, our brand and operating results could be harmed. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas
of our internal controls that need improvement. For example, for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we reported that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the lack of resources and the reliance on outside consultants. We intend to increase
management s review of our financials. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate
controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties
encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior
internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect
on the trading price of our stock. 

Additional Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

Because we are quoted on the OTC QB marketplace
instead of a national securities exchange, our investors may experience significant volatility in the market price of our stock and have
difficulty selling their shares. 

Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Market
Group s OTC QB marketplace under the ticker symbol AVAI . The OTC is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time
quotes and last sale prices in over-the-counter securities. Trading in shares quoted on the OTC QB is often thin and characterized by
volatility. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including the lack of readily available price quotations, the absence
of consistent administrative supervision of bid and ask quotations, lower trading volume and market conditions. As a result, there may
be wide fluctuations in the market price of the shares of our Common Stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance, and this volatility,
when it occurs, may have a negative effect on the market price for our securities. Moreover, the OTC QB is not a stock exchange, and trading
of securities on this platform is more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national quotation system or stock exchange.
Accordingly, our stockholders may not be able to realize a fair price from their shares when they determine to sell them or may have to
hold them for a substantial period of time until the market for our Common Stock improves. 

Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile,
which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders. 

The equity trading markets may experience periods
of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our Common Stock
could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition.
In addition, the trading volume in our Common Stock has been low and may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We
have experienced significant volatility in the price of our stock. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable
price and volume fluctuations. 

We have not paid dividends in the past and have
no immediate plans to pay cash dividends. 

We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent
we have earnings, to develop and deliver our products and cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do
not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any
time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our Common Stock as a dividend. Therefore,
you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our Common Stock. 

Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect
the market for our Common Stock. 

Of the 117,167,906 shares of our Common Stock outstanding
as of the date of this Annual Report, approximately 78,959,044 are restricted and 38,208,862shares are freely tradable without restriction
pursuant to Rule 144. Any substantial sale of our Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material
adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. 

You may experience future dilution as a result
of future equity offerings. 

To raise additional capital, we may in the future
offer additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock at prices that may
not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any future offering at a price per
share that is lower than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, which would result in those newly issued shares being
dilutive. In addition, investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders,
which could impair the value of your shares. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our Common Stock, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into shares of our Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid
by investors in this offering. 

33 

Our charter documents and Nevada law may inhibit
a takeover that stockholders consider favorable. 

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and applicable provisions of Nevada law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control
or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions
that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: 

limit who may call stockholder meetings; 

do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and 

provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum. 

There are limitations on director/officer liability. 

As permitted by Nevada law, our certificate of incorporation
limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a director s fiduciary duty except for liability in certain
instances. As a result of our charter provision and Nevada law, shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for
breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to
the fullest extent permitted by law. 

Penny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on marketability
of our securities. 

The SEC adopted regulations which generally define
a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than 5 per share or an exercise price of less than
 5 per share, subject to certain exceptions. A security listed on a national securities exchange is exempt from the definition of a penny
stock. Our Common Stock is not currently listed on a national security exchange. Our Common Stock is therefore subject to rules that impose
additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons 

other than established customers and accredited investors
(generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000, or 300,000 together with their spouse). For
transactions covered by such rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. 

Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny
stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating
to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative,
current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker dealer must disclose this fact and
the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must wait two business days
after providing buyers with disclosure materials regarding a security before effecting a transaction in such security. Consequently, the
 penny stock rules restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and affect the ability of investors to sell
our securities in the secondary market and the price at which such purchasers can sell any such securities, thereby affecting the liquidity
of the market for our Common Stock. 

Stockholders should also be aware that, according
to the SEC, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: 

control of the market for the security by one or more broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; 

manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; 

boiler room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; 

excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and 

the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses. 

34 

FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder s
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (referred
to as FINRA) has rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing
that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status,
investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high
probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are
applicable to us or our securities, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers
buy our Common Stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect
on the market for and price of our common stock. 

ITEM 2. 
 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

No unregistered shares were sold
during the six-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. 
 DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITES. 

No senior securities were issued and outstanding during the six-month period
ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 5. 
 OTHER INFORMATION.

is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
