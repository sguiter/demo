 The Company does not believe that the available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, which were comprised of individual securities, represent a credit loss impairment. All of these securities were issued by U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, local municipalities, or represent corporate debt. The securities issued by the U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The securities issued by local municipalities and the corporate debt issues were all highly rated by major rating agencies and have no history of credit losses. The unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in the interest rate environment and not due to the credit quality of these investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, t he Company does not have the intent to sell these investment securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. 
 
 All of the Company s held-to-maturity debt securities are issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The decline in fair value of the held-to-maturity debt securities were primarily attributable to changes in the interest rate environment and not due to the credit quality of these investment securities, therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of September 30, 2024.

 Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extensions, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged off against the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of concessions to one loan. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For loans included in the "combination" columns below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period. The combination is at least two of the following: a term extension, principal forgiveness, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, and/or an interest rate reduction.

 The modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress are included in their respective portfolio segment and the current loan balance and updated loan terms are run through their respective ACL models to arrive at the quantitative portion of the ACL. Subsequent performance of the loans will be measured by delinquency status and will be captured through our ACL models or our qualitative factor assessment, as deemed appropriate. If we no longer believe the loan demonstrates similar risks to their respective portfolio segment an individual assessment will be performed. Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount.

Table of Contents 

 million classified as special mention or substandard are reviewed quarterly for deterioration or improvement to determine if the loan is appropriately classified. We use the following definitions for risk ratings other than pass: 
 
 Special Mention Loans designated as special mention have specific, well-defined risk issues, which create a high level of uncertainty regarding the long-term viability of the business. Loans in this class are considered to have high-risk characteristics. A special mention loan exhibits material negative financial trends due to company-specific or systemic conditions. If these potential weaknesses are not mitigated, they threaten the borrower s capacity to meet its debt obligations. Special mention loans still demonstrate sufficient financial flexibility to react to and positively address the root cause of the adverse financial trends without significant deviations from their current business strategy. Their potential weaknesses deserve our close attention and warrant enhanced monitoring. 
 
 Substandard Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard. In addition, those weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. A loan classified as doubtful exhibits discernible loss potential, but a complete loss seems very unlikely. The possibility of a loss on a doubtful loan is high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may strengthen the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more exact status can be determined. 
 
 Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such value that the continuance as a loan is not warranted. A loss classification does not mean that the loan has no recovery or salvage value; instead, it means that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off all or a portion of a basically worthless loan even though partial recovery may be possible in the future. 
 
 For Personal Banking loans a pass risk rating is maintained until they are 90 days or greater past due, and risk rating reclassification is based primarily on past due status of the loan. The risk rating categories can generally be described by the following groupings: 
 
 Pass Loans classified as pass are homogeneous loans that are less than 90 days past due from the required payment date at month-end. 
 
 Substandard Loans classified as substandard are homogeneous loans that are greater than 90 days past due from the required payment date at month-end, or homogenous retail loans that are greater than 180 days past due from the required payment date at month-end that has been written down to the value of underlying collateral, less costs to sell. 
 
 Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful are homogeneous loans that are greater than 180 days past due from the required payment date at month-end and not written down to the value of underlying collateral. These loans are generally charged-off in the month in which the 180 day period elapses.

 Cash distributions on the trust securities are made on a quarterly basis to the extent interest on the debentures is received by the Trusts. We have the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time, or from time-to-time, for periods not exceeding . If interest payments on the subordinated debentures are deferred, the distributions on the trust securities also are deferred. To date there have been interest deferrals. Interest on the subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust securities is cumulative. Our obligation constitutes a full, irrevocable, and unconditional guarantee on a subordinated basis of the obligations of the trust under the preferred securities. For each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 total interest expense paid on trust preferred securities was million. 
 
 The Trusts must redeem the preferred securities when the debentures are paid at maturity or upon an earlier redemption of the debentures to the extent the debentures are redeemed. All or part of the debentures may be redeemed at any time.

 The following table represents the fair market measurement for only those nonrecurring assets that had a fair market value below the carrying amount as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 
 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total assets at fair value Loans individually assessed Mortgage servicing rights Real estate owned, net Total assets 
 
 Individually Assessed Loans - A loan is considered to be individually assessed as described in Note 1(f) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We classify loans individually assessed as nonrecurring Level 3. 
 
 Mortgage servicing rights - Mortgage servicing rights represent the value of servicing residential mortgage loans, when the mortgage loans have been sold into the secondary market and the associated servicing has been retained. The value is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses interest rates, prepayment speeds and delinquency rate assumptions as inputs. All of these assumptions require a significant degree of management judgment. Servicing rights and the related mortgage loans are segregated into categories or homogeneous pools based upon common characteristics. Adjustments are only made when the estimated discounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, as determined by individual pool. As such, mortgage servicing rights are classified as nonrecurring Level 3. 
 
 Real Estate Owned - Real estate owned is comprised of property acquired through foreclosure or voluntarily conveyed by borrowers. These assets are recorded on the date acquired at the lower of the related loan balance or fair value, less estimated disposition costs, with the fair value being determined by appraisal. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition date or fair value, less estimated disposition costs. We classify real estate owned as nonrecurring Level 3.

 separate pay-fixed interest rate swaps in order to synthetically convert short-term three month FHLB advances to fixed-rate term funding with an aggregate value of million with maturities ranging from three to . Our risk management objective and strategy for these interest rate swaps at such time was to reduce our exposure to variability in interest-related cash outflows attributable to changes in the USD-SOFR swap rate, the designated benchmark interest rate being hedged. Based upon our contemporaneous quantitative analysis at the inception of the interest rate swaps, we have determined these interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . Our cash flow hedges are recorded within other assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at their estimated fair value. 
 
 As long as the hedge remains highly effective, the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. A hedging relationship that is determined to not be highly effective no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and any gain or loss is recognized immediately into earnings. Amount reclassified into earnings are included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 
 We act as an interest rate or foreign exchange swap counterparty for certain commercial borrowers in the normal course of servicing our customers, which are accounted for at fair value. We manage our exposure to such interest rate or foreign exchange swaps by entering into corresponding and offsetting interest rate swaps with third parties that mirror the terms of the swaps we have with the commercial borrowers. These positions (referred to as customer swaps directly offset each other and our exposure is the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in credit risk of our commercial borrowers and third parties. Customer swaps are recorded within other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at their estimated fair value. Changes to the fair value of assets and liabilities arising from these derivatives are included, net, in other operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
 We enter into interest rate lock commitments for residential mortgage loans which commit us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specific interest rate within a specified period of time. Interest rate lock commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held-for-sale are considered derivative financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance. Interest rate lock commitments on loans held-for-sale are carried at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Northwest sells loans to the secondary market on a mandatory or best efforts basis. The loans sold on a mandatory basis commit us to deliver a specific principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price, by a specified date, or the commitment must be paired off. These forward commitments entered into on a mandatory delivery basis meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument. All closed loans to be sold on a mandatory delivery basis are classified as held-for-sale on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Changes to the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments and the forward commitments are recorded in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 We enter into risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which we are a participant. The risk participation agreements provide credit protection to the financial institution should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with the financial institution. These risk participation agreements are recorded within other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at their estimated fair value. Changes to the fair value of the the risk participation agreements are included in other operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

 Overview of Critical Accounting Policies Involving Estimates 
 
 Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 
 The following Accounting Standard Updates ASU issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") have 
 not yet been adopted. 
 
 In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, "Disclosure Improvements." This ASU includes amendments on several subtopics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification") to incorporate certain disclosures and presentation requirements currently residing in SEC Regulations S-X and S-K. The adoption of this ASU may lead to certain disclosures being relocated into the financial statements. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. These amendments are to be applied prospectively. If the SEC has not removed the applicable requirements from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K by June 30, 2027, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for any entity. We do not believe this guidance will have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" to improve disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This update requires that an entity that has a single reportable segment, such as the Company, to provide all the disclosures required by this update. The amendments in this update require annual and interim disclosures on significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker to make operating decisions and to allocate resources. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. A public entity should apply the amendments in this update retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 and does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, "Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." This ASU requires additional disaggregated disclosures on entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and additional details on income taxes paid. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, with early adoption permitted. This ASU is applied prospectively with the option to apply the ASU retrospectively. We do not believe this guidance will have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition 
 
 Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 14.4 billion, a decrease of 65 million from December 31, 2023. This decrease in assets was primarily driven by decreases in personal banking loans receivable, partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and commercial banking loans receivable. A discussion of significant changes follows. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 105 million, or 86 , to 227 million at September 30, 2024, from 122 million at December 31, 2023 due to growth in our deposits coupled with a focus on profitability and credit discipline while investing these cash flows into commercial loans. 
 
 Total marketable securities increased to 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 20 million, or 1 , from December 31, 2023. Available-for-sale securities increased by 69 million, driven by the securities portfolio restructure in the prior quarter, while held-to-maturity securities decreased 48 million, driven by maturities and regular monthly cash flows. 
 
 Gross loans receivable decreased by 110 million, or 1 , to 11.3 billion at September 30, 2024. Our personal banking loan portfolio decreased by 359 million, or 5 , to 6.4 billion at September 30, 2024 from 6.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Cash flows from our personal banking portfolio were partially redirected to fund commercial banking growth, which increased by 248 million, or 5 , to 4.9 billion at September 30, 2024, from 4.6 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase represents organic loan growth resulting from the new commercial lending verticals that we implemented during the prior year. Specifically, our commercial and industrial (C I) loan portfolio increased by 228 million, or 14 compared to December 31, 2023.

 Total deposits increased by 91 million, or 1 , to 12.1 billion at September 30, 2024 from 12.0 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by a 107 million, or 4 , increase in time deposits as we continued competitively positioning our deposit products, a 42 million, or 2 , increase in interest demand deposit accounts and a 41 million, or 2 , increase in savings deposits. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in non-interest bearing deposit accounts by 87 million, or 3 , due to seasonality in customer deposit account balances . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 212 million of brokered deposits, which made up 8 of our time deposits and 2 of our total deposit balance at quarter end. The balance carried an average all-in cost of 5.37 and an average original term of 12 months. These deposits were purchased through a registered broker, as part of an Asset/Liability Committee ALCO strategy to increase and diversify funding sources. 
 
 In addition, at quarter end we had 697 million of deposits through our participation in the Intrafi Network Deposits and FIS Insured Deposit programs. These deposits are part of a reciprocal program that allows our depositors to receive expanded FDIC coverage by placing multiple interest-bearing demand accounts at other member banks and Northwest receives an equal amount of deposits from other member banks. The balance carried an average cost of 3.91 . 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had total deposits in excess of 250,000 (the limit for FDIC insurance) of 1.9 billion and 1.8 billion respectively. At those dates, we had no deposits that were uninsured for any other reason. The following table presents details regarding the Company's uninsured deposits portfolio:

 Our largest uninsured depositor, excluding intercompany and collateralized deposit accounts, had an aggregate uninsured deposit balance of 19.6 million, or 0.16 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024. Our top ten largest uninsured depositors, excluding intercompany and collateralized deposit accounts, had an aggregate uninsured deposit balance of 103 million, or 0.85 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024. The average uninsured deposit account balance, excluding intercompany and collateralized accounts, was 285,000 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total shareholders equity remained stable at 1.6 billion, or 12.49 per share, at September 30, 2024 compared to 12.20 per share at December 31, 2023, increasing by 40 million in the current year. This increase was the result of year-to-date earnings of 68 million as well as an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 43 million, or 29 , primarily due to an increase in realized losses on our available-for-sale investment portfolio as a result of the investment sales made during the period, partially offset by 76 million of cash dividend payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Regulatory Capital 
 
 Financial institutions and their holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct, material effect on a company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, financial institutions must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting guidelines. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments made by the regulators about components, risk-weighting and other factors. 
 
 Applicable rules limit an organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 
 Quantitative measures, established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy, require financial institutions to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Total, CET1 and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined). Capital requirements are presented in the tables below (dollars in thousands).

 Regulatory Considerations 
 In September 2024, the FDIC adopted a final statement of policy regarding its review of Bank Merger Act BMA applications. The final policy statement addresses, among other things, an expanded scope of transactions subject to FDIC approval, a more rigorous process for evaluating BMA applications, and heightened expectations with respect to the BMA's statutory factors. As a result, BMA applications to the FDIC will now require additional information. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 We are required to maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets, as determined by management and reviewed for adequacy by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities during their regular examinations. Northwest frequently monitors its liquidity position primarily using the ratio of unencumbered available-for-sale liquid assets as a percentage of deposits and borrowings liquidity ratio ). Northwest Bank s liquidity ratio at September 30, 2024 was 11.25 . We adjust liquidity levels in order to meet funding needs for deposit outflows, payment of real estate taxes and insurance on mortgage loan escrow accounts, repayment of borrowings and loan commitments. At September 30, 2024, Northwest had 3.3 billion of additional borrowing capacity available with the FHLB, including 250 million on an overnight line of credit, which had no balance as of September 30, 2024, as well as 500 million of borrowing capacity available with the Federal Reserve Bank and 105 million with two correspondent banks. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 We paid 25 million in cash dividends during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The common stock dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share divided by net income per diluted share) for September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 76.9 and 64.5 on dividends of 0.20 per share. On October 17, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.20 per share payable on November 18, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2024. This represents the 120 th consecutive quarter we have paid a cash dividend. 
 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to nonperforming assets. Nonaccrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest has ceased. Generally, when a loan is 90 days past due, we fully reverse all accrued interest thereon and cease to accrue interest thereafter. Exceptions are made for loans that have contractually matured, are in the process of being modified to extend the maturity date and are otherwise current as to principal and interest, and well-secured loans that are in the process of collection. Loans may also be placed on nonaccrual before they reach 90 days past due if conditions exist that call into question our ability to collect all contractual interest. Other nonperforming assets represent property acquired through foreclosure or repossession. Foreclosed property is carried at the lower of its fair value less estimated costs to sell or the principal balance of the related loan.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 On an ongoing basis, the Credit Administration department, as well as loan officers and department heads, review and monitor the loan portfolio for problem loans. This portfolio monitoring includes a review of the monthly delinquency reports as well as historical comparisons and trend analysis. Personal and small business commercial loans are classified primarily by delinquency status. In addition, a meeting is held every quarter with each vertical to monitor the performance and status of commercial loans on an internal watch list. On an on-going basis, the loan officer, in conjunction with a portfolio manager, grades or classifies problem commercial loans or potential problem commercial loans based upon their knowledge of the lending relationship and other information previously accumulated. This rating is also reviewed independently by our Loan Review department on a periodic basis. Our loan grading system for problem commercial loans is consistent with industry regulatory guidelines which classifies loans as substandard , doubtful or loss . Loans that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the previous categories, but which possess some weaknesses, are designated as special mention . A substandard loan is any loan that is 90 days or more contractually delinquent or is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions or values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as loss have all the weakness inherent in those classified as doubtful and are considered uncollectible. 
 
 Credit relationships that have been classified as substandard or doubtful and are greater than or equal to 1.0 million are reviewed by the Credit Administration department to determine if they no longer continue to demonstrate similar risk characteristics to their loan pool. If a loan no longer demonstrates similar risk characteristics to their loan pool they are removed from the pool and an individual assessment will be performed. 
 
 If it is determined that a loan needs to be individually assessed, the Credit Administration department determines the proper measure of fair value for each loan based on one of three methods: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (2) the loan s observable market price; or (3) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, less costs of sale or disposal. If the measurement of the fair value of the loan is more or less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Credit Administration department adjusts the specific allowance associated with that individual loan accordingly. 
 
 If a substandard or doubtful loan is not individually assessed, it is grouped with other loans that possess common characteristics for credit losses and analysis. For the purpose of calculating reserves, we have grouped our loans into seven segments: residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, vehicle loans, consumer loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial real estate loans - owner occupied and commercial loans. The allowance for credit losses is measured using a combination of statistical models and qualitative assessments. We use a twenty four month forecasting period and revert to historical average loss rates thereafter. Reversion to average 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 loss rates takes place over twelve months. Historical average loss rates are calculated using historical data beginning in October 2009 through the current period. 
 
 The credit losses for individually assessed loans along with the estimated loss for each homogeneous pool are consolidated into one summary document. This summary schedule along with the support documentation used to establish this schedule is presented to management s Allowance for Credit Losses Committee ACL Committee monthly. The ACL Committee reviews and approves the processes and ACL documentation presented. Based on this review and discussion, the appropriate amount of ACL is estimated and any adjustments to reconcile the actual ACL with this estimate are determined. The ACL Committee also considers if any changes to the methodology are needed. In addition to the ACL Committee s review and approval, a review is performed by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and annually by internal audit. 
 
 In addition to the reviews by management s ACL Committee and the Board of Directors Risk Management Committee, regulators from either the FDIC and/or the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities perform an extensive review on at least an annual basis for the adequacy of the ACL and its conformity with regulatory guidelines and pronouncements. Any recommendations or enhancements from these independent parties are considered by management and the ACL Committee and implemented accordingly. 
 
 We acknowledge that this is a dynamic process and consists of factors, many of which are external and out of our control that can change frequently, rapidly and substantially. The adequacy of the ACL is based upon estimates using all the information previously discussed as well as current and known circumstances and events. There is no assurance that actual portfolio losses will not be substantially different than those that were estimated. 
 
 We utilize a structured methodology each period when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses, which the ACL Committee assesses regularly for appropriateness. As part of the analysis as of September 30, 2024, we considered the most recent economic conditions and forecasts available which incorporated the impact of material recent economic events. In addition, we considered the overall trends in asset quality, reserves on individually assessed loans, historical loss rates and collateral valuations. The ACL increased by 0.6 million to 126 million, or 1.11 of total loans at September 30, 2024, up slightly from 1.10 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Total classified loans increased by 101 million to 320 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 218 million at December 31, 2023. The primary driver of the increase over the current year is reflective of the Company s exposure to the Long Term Healthcare segment and the challenges a few operators have experienced post Covid. 
 
 We also consider how the levels of nonaccrual loans and historical charge-offs have influenced the required amount of allowance for credit losses. Nonaccrual loans of 77 million at September 30, 2024 decreased by 18 million, or 19 , from 94 million at December 31, 2023, or 0.68 of total loans receivable as of September 30, 2024 and 0.83 of total loans receivable as of December 31, 2023. As a percentage of average loans, annualized net charge-offs remained low at 0.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.11 for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Comparison of Operating Results for the Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 The following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to the the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 

Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 34 million, or 0.26 per diluted share, a decrease of 6 million, or 14 , from net income of 39 million, or 0.31 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income resulted primarily from a 4 million increase in the provision for credit losses, a 3 million, or 10 , decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense of 3 million, or 4 , partially offset by an increase in net interest income of 3 million, or 3 , and a 2 million, or 14 , decrease in income tax expense. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 represents annualized returns on average equity and average assets of 8.50 and 0.93 , respectively, compared to 10.27 and 1.08 for the same quarter last year. 
 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 68 million, or 0.53 per diluted share, a decrease of 51 million, or 37 , from net income of 138 million, or 0.83 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income resulted primarily from a 39 million loss on sale of securities, a decrease in net interest income of 8 million, or 2 , and an increase in noninterest expense of 12 million, or 5 , partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses of 7 million, or 47 , and a 13 million, or 14 , decrease in income tax expense. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents annualized returns on average equity and average assets of 5.80 and 0.63 , respectively, compared to 9.37 and 0.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. A further discussion of notable changes follows. 
 
 To make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in the discussion below on a fully taxable equivalent FTE basis (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, 100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as 126, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 , would yield 100. See the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for information regarding tax-equivalent adjustments and GAAP results.

 Net Interest Income 

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was 111 million which increased 3 million, or 3 , from the third quarter of 2023. Net interest income (FTE) was 112 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and net interest margin (FTE) was 3.33 . Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, net interest income (FTE) increased 3 million and net interest margin (FTE) increased by ten basis points . The increase in net interest income (FTE) and net interest margin (FTE) was driven by an increase in interest income resulting from higher earning asset yields. Partly offsetting this increase was an increase in interest-bearing deposit costs and a shift in funding mix to higher cost deposits due to the higher interest rate environment. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 321 million which decreased 8 million, or 2 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income (FTE) was 324 million, a decrease of 8 million, or 2 from the same period last year. Net interest margin (FTE) decreased by 11 basis points. Similar to the quarterly fluctuations noted above, the decrease in net interest income (FTE) included increases in both interest income and interest expense driven by higher interest-bearing deposit costs and balances, partially offset by higher interest-earning asset yields and balances.

Average loans receivable increased 33 million, or 0.3 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 263 million, or 2.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by commercial loans, which grew by 372 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 456 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we have continued to build-out our commercial lending verticals, and commercial real estate loans, which grew by 84 million and 148 million from the same periods. These increases were offset partially by a 423 million decrease in personal banking loans from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 341 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on loans receivable increased by 16 million, or 11 , from the same quarter in the prior year, and by 63 million, or 16 , from the same nine-month period in the prior year, the result of increases in both the average yield and the average balance on loans receivable. The average yield on loans receivable increased due to the elevated market interest rates as well as a change in mix to higher yield loan products. 
 
 Average investments declined 6 from the third quarter of 2023 and 9 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the sale of investment securities during the third quarter of 2024 coupled with regular principal payments and maturities. Interest income on investment securities increased by 3 million, or 31 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and increased by 3 million, 9.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to the increase in the average yield on investments (FTE) to 2.48 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which was partially offset by a decline in the average balance of investments for both periods. 
 
 Average deposits grew 3 from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 4 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by an increase in our average time deposits due to customer preferences for this fixed maturity product type which grew by 666 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and by 1.1 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was partially offset by a 146 million decrease in money market balances from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 284 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as customers shifted balances into higher yielding time deposit accounts. Interest expense on deposits increased by 23 million, or 71 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and by 90 million, or 139 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to increases in both the average yield and average balance of deposit accounts as we continued competitively positioning our deposit products. 
 
 Compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, average borrowings saw a 66 reduction, and compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 average borrowings decreased 54 primarily attributable to the strategic pay-down of wholesale borrowings. This decrease was made possible by a substantial increase in cash reserves, resulting from the sale of investment securities during the prior quarter, as well as a notable rise in the average balance of deposits. The decrease in the average balance of borrowings resulted in a decrease in interest expense on borrowings by 6 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and by 14 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The provision for credit losses increased by 4 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase included a 2 million increase in the provision for credit losses - loans, as well as a 2 million increase in the provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments. 
 
 Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for credit losses decreased 7 million , or 47 . This decrease included a 3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses - loans, as well as a 4 million decrease in the provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments. 
 
 The changes in the provision noted above is driven by growth within our commercial lending portfolio and changes in the economic forecasts coupled with a decline in our reserves for unfunded commitments in the current period. This decline is based on the timing of origination and funding of commercial construction loans and lines of credit. 
 
 Additionally, the Company saw an increase in classified loans to 320 million, or 2.83 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 from 209 million, or 1.84 of total loans, at September 30, 2023 and 257 million, or 2.26 of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The primary driver of the increase over the past year and quarter is reflective of the Company s exposure to the Long Term Healthcare segment and the challenges a few operators have experienced post Covid.

Table of Contents 

In determining the amount of the current period provision, we considered current and forecasted economic conditions, including but not limited to improvements in unemployment levels, expected economic growth, bankruptcy filings, and changes in real estate values and the impact of these factors on the quality of our loan portfolio and historical loss experience. We analyze the allowance for credit losses as described in the section entitled Allowance for Credit Losses. The provision that is recorded is sufficient, in our judgment, to bring this reserve to a level that reflects the current expected lifetime losses in our loan portfolio relative to loan mix, a reasonable and supportable economic forecast period and historical loss experience at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Noninterest Income 

(a) Other noninterest income includes the net gain on real estate owned, mortgage banking income, and other operating income. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 
 Noninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 28 million, a decrease of 3 million, or 10 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by a 3 million decline in income from bank-owned life insurance as a result of death benefits received in the prior period. Compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, excluding the loss on sale of securities of 39 million, noninterest income increased 2 million, or 2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by service charges and fees and the gain on sale of SBA loans. Service charges and fees increased 4 million, or 9 , to 47 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by commercial loan fees and deposit related fees based on customer activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Additionally, the gain on the sale of SBA loans increased 2 million, or 112 , to 3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased loan sale activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in income from bank owned life insurance of 3 million, or 40 , to 4 million due to death benefits received in the prior period. 
 
 Noninterest Expense 
 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 (a) Other noninterest expense includes collections expense, marketing expense, FDIC insurance expense, amortization of intangible assets, real estate owned expense, merger, asset disposition and restructuring expense, and other expenses. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased by 3 million, or 4 , from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in c ompensation and employee benefits expense of 5 million, or 10 , to 56 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 51 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 driven primarily by the build out of the commercial business and related credit, risk management, and internal audit support functions over the past year c oupled with an increase in contracted employees utilized during the quarter and an increase in employee benefits expense. 
 
 Noninterest expense increased 12 million, or 5 , to 273 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 261 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in c ompensation and employee benefits expense of 16 million, or 11 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the same reasons noted above. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in non-personnel expense related to a decline in merger, asset disposition and restructuring expense and marketing expenses. Marketing expenses decreased by 2 million, or 19 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to the timing of deposit marketing campaigns. Merger, asset disposition and restructuring expense decreased 1 million, or 34 , due to the severance and fixed asset charges related to the branch optimization and personnel reductions during the prior year. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes decreased by 2 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 13 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to lower income before income taxes. 
 
 The provision for income taxes is primarily driven by changes in our current period income before taxes. We anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 22.0 and 24.0 for the year ending December 31, 2024.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As the holding company for a savings bank, one of our primary market risks is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income to variations in interest rates over a specified time period. The sensitivity results from differences in the time periods in which interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities mature or re-price. We attempt to control interest rate risk by matching, within acceptable limits, the re-pricing periods of assets and liabilities. We have attempted to limit our exposure to interest sensitivity by increasing core deposits, enticing customers to extend certificates of deposit maturities, borrowing funds with fixed-rates and longer maturities and by shortening the maturities of our assets by emphasizing the origination of more short-term fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans. We also have the ability to sell a portion of the long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans that we originate. In addition, we purchase shorter term or adjustable-rate investment securities and mortgage-backed securities. 
 
 We have an Asset/Liability Committee consisting of members of management which meets monthly to review market interest rates, economic conditions, the pricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the balance sheet structure. On a quarterly basis, this Committee also reviews the interest rate risk position and cash flow projections. 
 
 The Board of Directors has a Risk Management Committee which meets quarterly and reviews interest rate risk and trends, our interest sensitivity position, the liquidity position and the market risk inherent in the investment portfolio. 
 
 In an effort to assess interest rate risk and market risk, we utilize a simulation model to determine the effect of immediate incremental increases and decreases in interest rates on net income and the market value of equity. Certain assumptions are made regarding loan prepayments and decay rates of savings and interest-bearing demand accounts. Because it is difficult to accurately project the market reaction of depositors and borrowers, the effect of actual changes in interest rates on these assumptions may differ from simulated results. We have established the following guidelines for assessing interest rate risk: 
 
 Net interest income simulation . Given a parallel shift of 100 basis points bps ), 200 bps and 300 bps in interest rates, the estimated net income may not decrease by more than 5 , 10 and 15 , respectively, within a one-year period. 
 
 Net income simulation . Given a parallel shift of 100 bps, 200 bps and 300 bps in interest rates, the estimated net income may not decrease by more than 10 , 20 and 30 , respectively, within a one-year period. 
 
 Market value of equity simulation . The market value of equity is the present value of assets and liabilities. Given a parallel shift of 100 bps, 200 bps and 300 bps in interest rates, the market value of equity may not decrease by more than 15 , 30 and 35 , respectively, from the computed economic value at current interest rate levels. 
 
 The following table illustrates the simulated impact of a 100 bps, 200 bps or 300 bps upward or a 100 bps, 200 bps or 300 bps downward movement in interest rates on net income, return on average equity, earnings per share and market value of equity. This analysis was prepared assuming that interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability levels at September 30, 2024 remain constant. The impact of the rate movements was computed by simulating the effect of an immediate and sustained shift in interest rates over a twelve-month period from September 30, 2024 levels. 
 Increase Decrease Parallel shift in interest rates over the next 12 months 100 bps 200 bps 300 bps 100 bps 200 bps 300 bps Projected percentage increase/(decrease) in net interest income (1.3) (3.0) (4.8) 0.3 (4.8 (7.1 Projected percentage increase/(decrease) in net income (3.1) (7.3) (11.5) 0.8 (11.9 (17.3 Projected increase/(decrease) in return on average equity (2.9) (6.9) (11.1) 0.8 (11.3 (16.7 Projected increase/(decrease) in earnings per share (0.03) (0.08) (0.13) 0.01 (0.13) (0.19) Projected percentage increase/(decrease) in market value of equity (5.6 (11.9 (18.3 3.3 3.6 2.9 
 
 The figures included in the table above represent projections that were computed based upon certain assumptions including prepayment rates and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates. Actual results may differ significantly due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions, and actions that may be taken by management in response to interest rate changes.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 There were no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this report or in other factors that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are subject to a number of asserted and unasserted claims encountered in the normal course of business. We believe that any additional liability, other than that which has already been accrued, that may result from such potential litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements. However, we cannot presently determine whether or not any claims against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period. Refer to Note 11. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Except as previously disclosed, there have been no material updates or additions to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
