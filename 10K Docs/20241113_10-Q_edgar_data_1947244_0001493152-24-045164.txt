9.3
Restricted Shares 

On
September 23, 2022, the Company adopted an equity incentive plan (the Legacy Incentive Plan ). The Legacy Incentive Plan
only provides for the grant of restricted stock awards. The purpose of the Legacy Incentive Plan is to provide an incentive for employees,
directors and certain consultants and advisors of the Company or its subsidiaries to remain in the service of the Company or its subsidiaries.
The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the grant of the restricted stock awards is shares
of common stock in the Company. 

On
September 23, 2022, we granted awards of an aggregate of shares of performance based restricted shares (the Restricted
Shares under the Legacy Incentive Plan to certain of our and GoldMining s executive officers, directors and consultants,
the terms of which were amended on May 4, 2023. These awards are subject to performance-based restrictions, whereby the restrictions
will be cancelled if certain performance conditions are met in specified periods. As of September 30, 2024, of the Restricted
Shares remain unvested, with the balance having become vested and no longer subject to restrictions. 

The
unvested Restricted Shares are subject to restrictions that, among other things, prohibit the transfer thereof until certain performance
conditions are met. In addition, if such conditions are not met within applicable periods, the restricted shares will be deemed forfeited
and surrendered by the holder thereof to us without the requirement of any further consideration. The conditions are as follows: 

(a) 
 of the Restricted Shares, if we have not re-established the Whistler Project camp and performed of a minimum of 10,000
 meters of drilling prior to the date that is three years after the date of grant of such award; 

(b) 
 of the Restricted Shares, if we have not achieved a 250,000,000 market capitalization, based on the number of shares
 of our outstanding common stock multiplied by the volume-weighted average price for any applicable five (5) consecutive trading day
 period on the principal stock exchange on which our common stock is listed prior to the date that is five years after the date of
 grant of such award; or

Plan is to provide an incentive for employees, directors and certain consultants and advisors of the Company or its subsidiaries to remain
in the service of the Company or its subsidiaries. The 2023 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance awards, restricted stock awards and other cash and equity-based
awards. The aggregate number shares of common stock issuable under the 2023 Incentive Plan in respect of awards shall not exceed

Credit
Risk 

Credit
risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Company s credit risk is primarily associated with its bank balances. The Company mitigates credit risk associated with its
bank balances by holding cash with large, reputable financial institutions. 

Liquidity
Risk 

Liquidity
risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or manage its obligations associated with financial liabilities. To manage
liquidity risk, the Company closely monitors its liquidity position to ensure it has adequate sources of funding to finance its projects
and operations. The Company had working capital as at September 30, 2024, of . The Company s accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, current portion of lease liabilities and withholding taxes payable are expected to be realized or settled within a one-year
period. 

The
Company has not generated any revenue from operations and the only sources of financing to date have been through advances from GoldMining
and the IPO. The Company s ability to meet its obligations and finance exploration activities depends on its ability to generate
cash flow through the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to private placements, public offerings, including under the ATM Program,
and short-term or long-term loans. Capital markets may not be receptive to offerings of new equity from treasury or debt, whether by
way of private placements or public offerings. This may be further complicated by the limited liquidity for the Company s common
stock, restricting access to some institutional investors. The Company s growth and success is dependent on external sources of
financing which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. 

The
Company believes that the existing cash on hand will enable us to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve months commencing
from the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

and holds assets and liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency. Financial instruments that impact the Company s
net loss due to currency fluctuations include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities which
are denominated in Canadian dollars. The impact of a U.S. dollar change against Canadian dollars of 10 would have an impact of approximately
 on net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Recent
Developments 

2023
and 2024 Field Programs 

On
August 21, 2023, we announced the commencement of a confirmatory 2023 Phase 1 Drilling Program at the Whistler Project. Phase 1 of the
confirmatory program comprised up to an initial 5,000 meters of the budgeted drilling program. Four confirmatory drill holes were completed
for a total of 2,234 meters by mid-November, at which time the program was paused for winter break. 

On
January 16, 2024, we announced initial results from the abovementioned program, which confirmed the continuity of the near-surface high-grade
core at the Whistler deposit and included the best intercept of continuous mineralization intersected in drilling at the Whistler Project
to date, 547 meters at 1.06 grams per tonne g/t gold equivalent AuEq ). 

On
May 22, 2024, we announced an update regarding our proposed exploration program for 2024 and our preparations and mobilization for the
2024 field season. The focus of the exploration program is to confirm our understanding of the geological model and seek to further delineate
and extend areas of high-grade mineralization at the Whistler Project. 

19 

On
June 27, 2024, we announced the re-commencement of drilling at Whistler Project for the 2024 field season. The exploration program for
the current field season was focused on additional confirmatory infill and step-out drilling within the Whistler and Raintree West deposits.
Surface exploration activities were also conducted with the objective to identify drill targets within the broader Whistler Orbit, a
classic porphyry cluster with potential to discover additional mineralized intrusive centers. 

On
September 30, 2024, we announced initial assay results from the first two diamond drill holes completed of our 2024 Whistler Program.
The previous best intercept of continuous mineralization intersected in drilling at the Whistler Project during the 2023 exploration
program, comprising 547 meters at 1.06 g/t AuEq, was further deepened in the 2024 exploration program and extended to 652.5 meters at
1.00 g/t AuEq. 

On
October 7, 2024, we announced an updated mineral resource estimate for the Whistler Project, which included a 117 increase in indicated
classified resources. 

At-The-Market
Equity Program 

On
May 15, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to 40
million of a variety of securities including our common stock, preferred stock, warrants and/ or units. Additionally, we entered into
an At The Market Offering Agreement with a syndicate of agents for the ATM facility (the ATM Program ). Pursuant to the

 Working
 capital is the difference between the total current assets and total current liabilities. 

Prior
to the completion of our IPO, capital resources consisted primarily of cash advanced and/or contributed from GoldMining. On April 24,
2023, we completed our IPO and issued 2,000,000 units, consisting of one share of Common Stock and one Warrant (the Units at a price of 10.00 per Unit for net proceeds in an aggregate amount of approximately 19.1 million after deducting underwriting fees
and offering costs. In May 2023 we repaid GoldMining 1,680,925, for amounts previously advanced to us by GoldMining. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 4,401,101 (December 31, 2023: 11,203,893) and restricted cash of 88,469
(December 31, 2023: 87,756). The decrease in cash was primarily a result of exploration expenditures associated with our ongoing exploration
program for the 2024 field season at the Whistler Project. We had other receivables of 31,113 (December 31, 2023: 152,716). We had
inventories of 36,183 (December 31, 2023: 27,249), which included fuels held at the Whistler Project camp site. We had prepaid expenses
of 727,755 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 297,207 as of December 31, 2023. The increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due
to the 335,340 cash advances to a third party technical consulting company for management of the exploration program for the Whistler
Project, and the increase of prepaid corporate development expenses and dues and subscriptions expenses. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had current liabilities of 665,859, compared to 475,378 as of December 31, 2023. Current liabilities as of
September 30, 2024, consisted of: (i) accounts payable of 391,527, compared to 118,610 as of December 31, 2023; (ii) accrued liabilities
of 67,707, compared to 149,812 as of December 31, 2023; (iii) current portion of lease liabilities of 25,762, compared to 21,057
as of December 31, 2023; (iv) withholdings taxes payable of 180,863, which remained the same as of December 31, 2023; and (v) income
tax payable of nil compared to 5,036 as of December 31, 2023. 

We
have not generated any revenue from operations and the only sources of financing to date have been through advances from GoldMining,
the IPO and our ATM program. Our ability to meet our obligations and finance exploration activities depends on our ability to generate
cash flow through the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to private placements, public offerings, including under the ATM Program,
and short-term or long-term loans. Capital markets may not be receptive to offerings of new equity from treasury or debt, whether by
way of private placements or public offerings. This may be further complicated by the limited liquidity for our shares of Common Stock,
restricting access to some institutional investors. Our growth and success is dependent on external sources of financing which may not
be available on acceptable terms, or at all. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Commitments
Required to Keep Whistler Project in Good Standing 

We
are required to make annual land payments to the Department of Natural Resources of Alaska in the amount of 230,605 in 2024 and thereafter,
to keep the Whistler Project in good standing. Additionally, we have an annual labor requirement of 135,200 for 2024 and thereafter,
for which a cash-in-lieu payment equal to the value of the annual labor requirement may be made instead. We have excess labor carry forwards
of 167,674 expiring in 2026 and 1,766,156 expiring in 2027, of which up to 135,200 can be applied each year to meet our annual labor
requirements. The Whistler Project is in good standing as of the date of this Quarterly Report. 

Future
Commitments 

On
November 27, 2020, GoldMining agreed to cause us to issue a 1.0 net smelter return NSR royalty on its Whistler Project
to Gold Royalty U.S. Corp. (a subsidiary of Gold Royalty Corp.). We also assigned certain buyback rights relating to an existing third
party royalty on the Whistler Project such that Gold Royalty U.S. Corp. has a right to acquire a 0.75 NSR (including an area of interest)
on the Whistler Project for 5,000,000 pursuant to such buyback rights. The royalty was subsequently assigned to Nevada Select Royalty,
Inc. (a subsidiary of Gold Royalty Corp.). 

In
August 2015 we acquired rights to the Whistler Project and associated equipment pursuant to an asset purchase agreement by and among
the Company, GoldMining, Kiska Metals Corporation Kiska and Geoinformatics Alaska Exploration Inc Geoinformatics ).
Pursuant to such agreement, we acquired rights and assumed obligations under several related underlying agreements. The first underlying
agreement is a Royalty Purchase Agreement between Kiska Metals Corporation, Geoinformatics Alaska Exploration Inc. and MF2 LLC. MF2 ),
dated December 16, 2014. This agreement grants MF2 a 2.75 percent NSR royalty over the Whistler Project area. The MF2 royalty was subsequently
assigned to Osisko Mining (USA) Inc. The second underlying agreement is an earlier agreement between Cominco American Incorporated and
Mr. Kent Turner (whose rights and obligations thereunder were assumed by the Company) dated October 1, 1999. This agreement concerns
a 2.0 percent net profit interest to Teck Resources, recently purchased by Sandstorm Gold, in connection with an Area of Interest specified
by standard township sub-division. 

25 

In
May 2024 we entered into an agreement with Equity Geoscience for the management of an exploration program for the Whistler Project.
The agreement included an approved work order totaling 3,500,000, with us holding the option for approval of additional expenditures
up to 2,000,000, for the period of January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. The work order may be paused, postponed or terminated by either
party with 30 days written notice. Additionally, as at September 30, 2024, we have paid 4,900,000 towards the approved work order. 

Transactions
with Related Parties 

During
the periods presented, we shared personnel, including key management personnel, office space, equipment, and various administrative services
with other companies, including GoldMining. Costs incurred by GoldMining were allocated between its related subsidiaries based on an
estimate of time incurred and use of services and are charged at cost. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
allocated costs from GoldMining to us were 5,511 and 23,877, respectively 6,662 and 70,374 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, respectively). Out of the allocated costs, 2,294 and 13,675 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
were noncash share-based compensation costs 2,286 and 39,781 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively).
The allocated costs from GoldMining were treated as a capital contribution, as there is no obligation or intent regarding the repayment
of such amounts by us. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amounts advanced to us or paid on our behalf by GoldMining were nil nil and
 470,805 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023). In May 2023, we repaid GoldMining 1,680,925, for amounts previously
advanced to us. The amount paid represented the full amount of the outstanding loan from GoldMining at the time. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 1,299 and 140,812, respectively, and during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, 71,838 and 166,434, respectively, in general and administrative costs, paid to Blender Media Inc., a company
whose principal is an immediate family member of a co-chairman and director of GoldMining, for information technology, corporate branding,
sponsorships and advertising, media, website design, maintenance and hosting services provided by Blender to the Company. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, share-based compensation costs included 2,132 and 7,232, respectively 3,344 and
 28,502 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023), in amounts incurred for a co-chairman and director of GoldMining
for performance based restricted shares of our Common Stack granted to such individual in September 2022. 

Related
party transactions are based on the amounts agreed to by the parties. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we did
not enter into any contracts or undertake any commitment or obligation with any related parties other than as described herein. 

Our
Audit Committee is charged with reviewing and approving all related party transactions and reviewing and making recommendations to our
board of directors, or approving any contracts or other transactions with any of our current or former executive officers. The Charter
of the Audit Committee sets forth our written policy for the review of related party transactions. 

Outstanding
Securities 

As
of the date hereof, we have 12,444,608 shares of Common Stock outstanding. In addition, we have outstanding stock options issued under
our long-term incentive plan to purchase 185,550 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 10 per share, and outstanding Warrants
to purchase 1,741,092 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 13 per share. The exercise of stock options and Warrants is at
the discretion of their respective holders and, accordingly, there is no assurance that any of the stock options or warrants will be
exercised in the future.

Critical
Accounting Estimates and Judgments 

The
preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments and estimates and form assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and
expenses during the year. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its judgments and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, income
and expenses. Management uses historical experience and various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the given circumstances
as the basis for its judgments and estimates. Actual outcomes may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

Information
about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial
statements is as follows: 

Asset
retirement obligation 

An
asset retirement obligation represents the present value of estimated future costs for the rehabilitation of our mineral property. These
estimates include assumptions as to the future activities, cost of services, timing of the rehabilitation work to be performed, inflation
rates, exchange rates and interest rates. The actual cost to rehabilitate a mineral property may vary from the estimated amounts because
there are uncertainties in factors used to estimate the cost and potential changes in regulations or laws governing the rehabilitation
of a mineral property. Management periodically reviews the rehabilitation requirements and adjusts the liability as new information becomes
available and will assess the impact of new regulations and laws as they are enacted. 

Allocation
of expenses from GoldMining 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, certain general administrative expenses, including employment related expenditures
for services and support functions provided by GoldMining, were allocated on a pro-rata basis considered by GoldMining to be a reasonable
reflection of the utilization of services provided to us. 

Restricted
Shares 

The
fair value of the restricted shares is measured at grant date and recognized over the period during which the restricted shares vest.
When restricted shares are conditional upon the achievement of a performance condition, we estimate the length of the expected vesting
period at grant date, based on the most likely outcome of the performance condition. The fair value of the restricted shares is determined
based on the fair value of the shares of Common Stock on the grant date, adjusted for lack of marketability discount, minority shareholder
discount, and other applicable factors that are generally recognized by market participants. 

Stock
Options 

We
grant stock options to certain of our directors, officers, employees and consultants. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
determine the grant date fair value of stock options. The fair value of stock options granted to employees is recognized as an expense
over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. An individual is classified as an employee when the individual is an
employee for legal or tax purposes, provides services that could be provided by a direct employee, or has authority and responsibility
for planning, directing and controlling our activities, including non-executive directors. The fair value is measured at grant date and
recognized over the period during which the options vest. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. 

The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses as inputs the fair value of our shares of Common Stock and assumptions we make for the volatility
of our shares of Common Stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the
expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. We have historically been a private company and continue to lack
sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimate our expected share volatility based
on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate
historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded share price.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In
November 2023 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updates (the ASU 2023-07, the amendments improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant
segment expenses . In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity
can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable
segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The purpose of the amendments is to enable investors to better understand
an entity s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are
effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements. 

In
December 2023 the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU expands public entities 
income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well
as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures
that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2024. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted.
Management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements. 

In
March 2024 the SEC adopted new climate disclosure rules. These rules require companies to publish information that describes the climate-related
risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on a company s business or consolidated financial statements. The rules
reflect the SEC s efforts to respond to investors demand for more consistent, comparable, and reliable information about
the financial effects of climate-related risks on a registrant s operations and how it manages those risks while balancing concerns
about mitigating the associated costs of the rules. Management is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements. 

JOBS
Act 

In
April 2012 the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or
revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
continue the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act.
Subject to certain conditions, as an emerging growth company, we may rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation,
providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which
we have total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of
the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the
previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

It

assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
