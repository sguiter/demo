 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

In
addition, on May 23, 2024, HB Pharma Corp. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to which it changed its name to Hillstream Oncology, Inc. effective as of May 23,
2024. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred operating losses in the amount of approximately million, expended
approximately million in net cash used in operating activities, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as
of September 30, 2024. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has primarily financed its operations through public and private offerings
of its equity securities. The Company received net proceeds from its initial public offering IPO on January 14, 2022
of approximately million. Additionally, the Company closed a public offering (the May Offering of its common stock
on May 2, 2023. Net proceeds to the Company from the May Offering were approximately million. The Company recently closed an additional
public offering (the November Offering of its common stock on November 30, 2023. Net proceeds to the Company from the
November Offering were approximately million. See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for details regarding
the May and November Offerings. In addition, on June 7, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC using
a shelf registration process pursuant to which, under an At the Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement ),
the Company may sell, from time to time through the applicable sales manager, shares of common stock in one or more offerings up to a
total dollar amount of million. Further, on June 17, 2024, the Company closed a private placement offering (the PIPE Offering with certain accredited investors, consisting of an offering of shares of the Company s common stock and/or pre-funded warrants
to acquire shares of the Company s common stock and warrants to acquire shares of the Company s common stock, with net proceeds
to the Company of approximately million. The shares of the Company s common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market
on January 12, 2022 under the ticker symbol HILS and effective as of September 25, 2023, are traded under the ticker symbol
 THAR. 

Based
on the Company s limited operating history, recurring negative cash flows from operations, current plans and available resources,
the Company will need substantial additional funding to support future operating activities. The Company has concluded that the prevailing
conditions and ongoing liquidity risks faced raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
for at least one year following the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company may seek to raise additional funding through the sale of additional equity or debt securities, enter into strategic partnerships,
grants, or other arrangements or a combination of the foregoing to support its future operations, however, there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company, on a timely basis or at all. The failure
to obtain sufficient additional funding could adversely affect the Company s ability to achieve its business objectives and product
development timelines and may result in the Company delaying or terminating clinical trial activities which could have a material adverse
effect on the Company s results of operations. 

Other
Risks and Uncertainties 

There
can be no assurance that the Company s products, if approved, will be accepted in the marketplace, nor can there be any assurance
that any future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost and with appropriate performance characteristics, or
that such products will be successfully marketed, if at all. The Company is subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies including,
but not limited to, the development of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology,
compliance with government regulations, product liability, uncertainty of market acceptance of products and the need to obtain additional
financing. The Company is dependent on third party suppliers. The Company s products require approval or clearance from the FDA
prior to commencing commercial sales in the United States. Approvals or clearances are also required in foreign jurisdictions in which
the Company may license or sell its products. There can be no assurance that the Company s products will receive all of the required
approvals or clearances. 

Letter
of Intent 

On
September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a nonbinding, exclusive letter of intent (the LOI with Intract pursuant to
which the Company will acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of privately-held Intract in exchange for newly issued restricted
common stock. Under the terms of the LOI, following the execution of a definitive agreement and the closing of the merger, Intract shareholders
will own of the total equity in the Company, with Intract becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid an exclusivity fee of to enter into the LOI. 

pursuant to an amendment
to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and approved by the Company s
board of directors and stockholders. On May 24, 2024, the Company effectuated an additional reverse split of shares of its common stock
at a ratio of pursuant to an amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State and approved by the Company s board of directors and stockholders. The par value of the Company s common
stock was not adjusted as a result of either reverse split. All issued and outstanding common stock share and per share amounts contained
in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect these reverse splits for all periods presented. 

per depositor. At various times during the year, bank account balances may have been in
excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced losses in such accounts. The Company believes that it is not subject
to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. 

The
carrying value of the Company s cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of
the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

The
valuation hierarchy is composed of three levels. The classification within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels within the valuation hierarchy are described below: 

Level
 1 Inputs: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date
 for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2 Inputs: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These
 include quoted prices for assets or liabilities recently traded in active markets, with similar underlying terms, as well as direct
 or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, as well
 as quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level
 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs, such as estimates, assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists
 for the assets or liabilities, that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions.

consolidated balance sheets.

pursuant to which, the Company may sell, from time to time in one or more offerings, shares of common stock and preferred stock, various
series of debt securities and/or warrants to purchase any of such securities, either individually or as units comprised of a combination
of one or more of the other securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million. 

On

pruritis or uncontrollable itching. With respect to TH104, we intend to first seek approval for the treatment of moderate-to-severe
chronic pruritis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis PBC ), an orphan rare form of liver disease with no known
cure in which more than 70 of patients suffer from debilitating chronic pruritic. The Company expects to obtain topline data in a Phase
2 trial with TH104 in Q4 2025 and with respect to TH103, we intend to develop the product candidate and potentially file an IND. 

On
September 11, 2024, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the Intract Agreement with Intract Pharma Limited Intract ),
pursuant to which, we exclusively licensed INT-023/TH023, an oral anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF- monoclonal antibody
infliximab. Infliximab is a purified, recombinant DNA-derived chimeric IgG monoclonal antibody protein that contains both murine and
human components that inhibit tumor TNF- . Under the terms of the Intract Agreement, we licensed global development and commercialization
rights (outside of South Korea) to Intract s Soteria and Phloral delivery platform along with an existing supply agreement
for infliximab to be used in the oral product development program. 

We
are also developing an early-stage pipeline of novel therapeutic candidates targeting validated high value immuno-oncology IO targets including human epidermal growth factor EGF receptor 2 HER2 ), human EGF receptor 3 HER3 and programmed cell death protein 1 PD-1 ). We are developing antibodies including bispecific antibodies, antibody drug
conjugates ADCs and small molecular weight bovine-derived Picobodies or antibody knob domains which
have the potential to target and bind more tightly to undruggable epitopes better than full sized antibodies. We are advancing
TH3215, a bispecific against both HER2 and HER3 antibody which targets a novel bridging epitope encompassing multiple domains
of the HER2 extracellular domain ECD as well as ligand-dependent and independent blocking of the ECD of HER3 into IND-enabling
studies in 2025. In addition, we anticipate that TH0059, a HER2/HER3 bispecific ADC bsADC ), and TH1940, a PD-1 Picobody,
will progress to enter IND-enabling studies in 2025. 

5 

The
critical components of our business strategy to achieve our goals include: 

Develop
 TH104 as a transmucosal buccal film product for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic pruritis in PBC and other inflammatory
 diseases; 

Develop
 TH023 by obtaining regulatory authorization to initiate a first-in-human bioavailability clinical trial and pursue an IND through
 the US FDA; 

Create
 a preclinical and clinical path forward for, TH1940, a novel PD-1 knob-domain antibody fragment with nolve binding differentiation
 compared to full length antibodies for IO vulnerable tumors; 

Continue
 to advance pre-clinical candidate selection activities against HER2/HER3 receptors with various antibody formats, including TH3215
 designed for multiple solid tumor types; 

Effectively
 create a development strategy for TH0059 as a bispecific ADC specifically targeted to both HER2 and HER3 receptors in high unmet
 need standard-of-care resistant tumors with a high capacity to metastasize 

Hasten
 the discovery of next generation multi-specific (bi- and tri) antibodies with binding capabilities to novel epitopes of combinations
 of HER2, HER3, PD-1, PD-L1, TROP2 with and without toxin delivery capacity to multiple high unmet need rare cancers and other validated
 immunology and metabolic targets, including glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) 

Pursue
 strategic collaboration opportunities including potential M A transactions to maximize the value of our pipeline to bring novel
 therapies to patients suffering from high unmet need conditions

Recent Developments 

 On
June 17, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors for the issuance and sale in a private
placement (the PIPE Offering ), consisting of an offering of shares of our common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to acquire
shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire shares of our common stock, with net proceeds of approximately 1.8 million. See Note
3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details regarding these
offerings. 

We
signed a manufacturing agreement for clinical trial supply with regards to TH104 and the upcoming Phase 2 clinical trial on July 25,
2024 with a contract manufacturing organization located in North Carolina. The development work includes both TH104 active product and
corresponding placebo batches expected to be released for clinical packaging by the end of the year. 

On
September 30, 2024, we entered into a nonbinding, exclusive letter of intent (the LOI with Intract pursuant to which we
will acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of the privately-held Intract for newly issued restricted common stock. Intract is
a biopharmaceutical company incorporated in England and Wales developing disruptive delivery solutions for oral biologics. Under the
terms of the LOI, following the execution of a definitive agreement and the closing of the merger, Intract shareholders will own 49 
of the total equity in the combined entity, which will be named Tharimmune, Inc., with Intract becoming a wholly owned subsidiary. We
believe the merger and business combination will form a best-in-class, transformative oral biologics company and the synergies between
our clinical-stage assets and Intract s delivery platform will drive pipeline growth. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, we paid a 75,000 exclusivity fee to enter into the LOI agreement. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We
have not recognized revenue since inception. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses include personnel costs associated with research and development activities, including third-party contractors
to perform research, conduct clinical trials, and manufacture drug supplies and materials as well as stock-based compensation for our
research and development personnel. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. 

We
accrue costs incurred by external service providers, including contract research organizations and clinical investigators, based on estimates
of service performed and costs incurred. These estimates include the level of services performed by third parties, patient enrollment
in clinical trials, administrative costs incurred by third parties, and other indicators of the services completed. Based on the timing
of amounts invoiced by service providers, we may also record payments made to those providers as prepaid expenses that will be recognized
as expense in future periods as the related services are rendered. 

We
have incurred research and development expenses related to the development of HSB-1216, which has been deprioritized. We expect that
our research and development expenses will increase as we plan for and commence our clinical trials of TH3215 and TH1940. 

9 

We
cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of future clinical trials of our product candidates, TH3215 and TH1940, or any
other product candidates we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of
any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any of
our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our current and future product candidates
will depend on a variety of factors, including: 

the
 scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our current product candidates, as well as of any future clinical
 trials of our future product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct; 

uncertainties
 in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; 

the
 actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition,
 manufacturing capability and commercial viability; 

significant
 and changing government regulations and regulatory guidance; and 

the
 timing and receipt of any marketing approvals. 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change
in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority
were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development
of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment
or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and consulting related expenses, including stock-based compensation for
our general and administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees and other corporate expenses,
including legal fees relating to corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax, and consulting services; insurance
costs; travel expenses and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities. 

We
expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support our
continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also incur expenses associated with being a public company,
including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, directors and officers insurance expenses,
corporate governance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income consists of interest income from funds held in our cash accounts.

and development expenses increased by 1.7 million, or 68 , to 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million
for nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in clinical trial expenses of approximately
 0.9 million due to completion of our Phase 1 clinical trial in TH104 and an increase of 1.5 million in license fees. These increases
were offset by a decrease of 0.5 million in pre-clinical expenses and a decrease of 0.1 million in stock-based compensation expense
related to our research and development personnel.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by less than 0.1 million, or 2 , to 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
from 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to
a decrease of 0.4 million in investor relations, a decrease of 0.3 million in insurance, a decrease of 0.1 million in professional
fees, and a decrease of 0.1 million in stock-based compensation expense related to our general and administrative personnel. These decreases
were offset by an increase in wages of 0.7 million and an increase of 0.1 million in director remuneration. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense decreased by 3,225, or 20 , to 12,926 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 16,151 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily related to the decrease in D O insurance premium financing liability. 

Interest

Interest
income increased by 127,338, or 134 , to 222,236 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 94,898 for nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in cash from the November 2023 Offering and the June 2024
PIPE Offering. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we incurred operating losses of approximately 8.6 million, expended approximately 7.9 million in cash in operating
activities, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately 33.1 million as of September 30, 2024. We have financed our working capital
requirements through September 30, 2024 primarily through the issuance of common stock in various public and private offerings. During
the year ended December 31, 2023, we received gross proceeds of approximately 13.6 million through public offerings of our common stock
in the May Offering and November Offering which generated net proceeds to us of approximately 2.1 million and 9.7 million, respectively.
In addition, on June 7, 2024, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC using a shelf registration process
pursuant to which, under an At the Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement ), we may sell, from time to time through
the applicable sales manager, shares of common stock in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of 1.65 million. Further,
on June 17, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors as a part of the PIPE Offering, consisting
of an offering of shares of our common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to acquire shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire
shares of our common stock, with net proceeds of approximately 1.8 million. See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details regarding these offerings. 

Based
on our limited operating history, recurring negative cash flows from operations, current plans and available resources, we will need
substantial additional funding to support future operating activities. We have concluded that the prevailing conditions and ongoing liquidity
risks faced by us raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year following the date these
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

We
may seek to raise additional funding through the sale of additional equity or debt securities, enter into strategic partnerships, grants
or other arrangements or a combination of the foregoing to support our future operations; however, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to obtain additional capital on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to obtain sufficient additional
funding could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives and product development timelines and may result in delaying
or terminating clinical trial activities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

and non-cash stock-based compensation of 0.5 million, offset by increases in prepaid and other current assets of 0.4 million and operating
liabilities of 0.3 million. 

Cash
used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 5.9 million which consisted of net loss of 6.8 million
and an increase of 0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of
 0.6 million, 0.3 million of non-cash stock issuance pursuant to a services agreement and an increase of 0.2 million in accounts payable. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.7 million. The net increase in financing activities
was due to proceeds from the PIPE Offering of 2.1 million and insurance premium financing liability of 0.4 million, offset by payments
of deferred offering costs of 0.5 million and repayments of insurance premium financing liability of 0.3 million. 

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.1 million. The net increase in financing activities
was from net cash proceeds of 2.3 million from the issuance of our common stock in connection with a public offering and 0.7 million
in proceeds received from insurance premium financing liability offset by deferred offering costs of 0.3 million and 0.6 million in
repayments of insurance premium financing liability. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
May 24, 2024, the Company effectuated an additional reverse split of shares of its common stock at a ratio of 1-for-15 pursuant to an
amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, filed with the Delaware Secretary of State and approved by
the Company s board of directors and stockholders. The par value of the Company s common stock was not adjusted as a result
of the reverse split. All issued and outstanding common stock share and per share amounts contained in the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse split for all periods presented. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. The estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes,
and management must select an amount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. Estimates are used in the following areas,
among others: research and development expense recognition, stock-based compensation, allowances of deferred tax assets, and cash flow
assumptions regarding going concern considerations. Although management believes the estimates that have been used are reasonable, actual
results could vary from the estimates that were used.

and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include personnel costs associated with research and
development activities, including third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials and manufacture drug supplies
and materials. We accrue for costs incurred by external service providers, including contract research organizations and clinical investigators,
based on our estimates of service performed and costs incurred. These estimates include the level of services performed by third parties,
patient enrollment in clinical trials, administrative costs incurred by third parties, and other indicators of the services completed. 

Stock-based
compensation 

Stock-based
compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants, and affiliates. We measure
stock-based compensation costs at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the requisite
service period. 

We
recognize compensation costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, non-employees and directors as an expense
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period based on a measurement of fair value for each
stock-based award. The fair value of each option grant to employees, non-employees and directors is estimated as of the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, net of actual forfeitures. The fair value is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. 

The
fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Prior to January
12, 2022, we were a private company and our common stock has only been publicly traded since that date. As a result, we lack company-specific
historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we have estimated our expected stock price volatility based on the historical
volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies. The expected term of stock options granted was between five and seven years. The
risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for
time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards 

See
Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides
that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of
the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

14 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii) complying with the requirement adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on financial statements.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total
annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of
the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three
years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 
as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

There
were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30,
2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedure, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedure relative to their costs. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.

factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024 Annual Report ). There have
been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the
risks described in our Annual Report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described
in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.
