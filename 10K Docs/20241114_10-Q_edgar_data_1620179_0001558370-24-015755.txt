 of the outstanding capital stock of XBP Europe as of September 30, 2024. The noncontrolling stockholders' proportionate share of stockholder s deficit in XBP Europe of million and million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is reflected as noncontrolling interest in XBP Europe in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Beginning on November 30, 2023, XBP Europe shares and warrants started trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbols XBP and XBPEW, respectively. Sale of Non-core Assets On June 8, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its high-speed scanner business, which was a part of its ITPS segment (as defined in Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies ), for a purchase price of approximately million. The sale of the high-speed scanner business does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. As a result of this transaction, the Company disposed of million of goodwill based on the relative fair value of the high-speed scanner business to the total fair value of the ITPS reporting unit. This transaction resulted in a total pre-tax gain of million included in selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Per the terms of the sales agreement, the Company may receive additional cash consideration Contingent Consideration upon the future occurrence of certain earn-out events described in the sales agreement. The Contingent Consideration, if any, will be recognized in the period the earn-out event occurs, and the Contingent Consideration is realizable. Held for Sale The Company classifies assets as held-for-sale disposal group in the period when all of the relevant criteria to be classified as held for sale are met. These criteria include management s commitment to sell the disposal group in its present condition and the sale being deemed probable of being completed within one year. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or estimated fair value less cost to sell. The fair values of disposal groups are estimated using accepted valuation techniques, including indicative listing prices. The Company considers historical experience, guidance received from third parties, and all information available at the time the estimates are made to derive fair value. Any loss resulting from the measurement is recognized in the period when the held for sale criteria are met. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the initial carrying value of the disposal group. Assets held-for-sale are not amortized or depreciated. As of September 30, 2024, certain on-demand printing operations of XBP Europe met the criteria for classification as held for sale and accordingly, was measured at carrying value since its carrying value was lesser than its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The Company recorded an goodwill impairment charge of million relating to the disposal group in impairment of goodwill in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company determined that the disposal group has not met the criteria to be disclosed as discontinued operations as it does not represent a significant strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. Assets and liabilities are presented in Assets of disposal group held for sale and liabilities of disposal group held for sale, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024.

The Company has accrued the unbilled receivables for work performed in accordance with the terms of contracts with customers. Deferred revenues relate to payments received in advance of performance under a contract. A significant portion of this balance relates to maintenance contracts or other service contracts where the Company received payments for upfront conversions or implementation activities which do not transfer a service to the customer but rather are used in fulfilling the related performance obligations that transfer over time. The advance consideration received from customers is deferred over the contract term. The Company recognized revenue of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, that had been deferred as of December 31, 2023. The Company recognized revenue of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, that had been deferred as of January 1, 2023.

 million and million of amortization for these costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, within depreciation and amortization expense in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized million and million of amortization for these costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, within depreciation and amortization expense in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. These costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition or fulfillment and can be separated into principal categories: contract commissions and fulfillment costs. Applying the in ASC 340-40-25-4, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred, if the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The effect of applying this practical expedient was not material. Customer deposits consist primarily of amounts received from customers in advance for postage. These advanced postage deposits are used to cover the costs associated with postage, with the corresponding postage revenue being recognized as services are performed. Performance Obligations At the inception of each contract, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in its contracts and identify each distinct performance obligation. The majority of the Company s contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts. For the majority of the Company s business and transaction processing service contracts, revenues are recognized as services are provided based on an appropriate input or output method, typically based on the related labor or transactional volumes. Certain of the Company s contracts have multiple performance obligations, including contracts that combine software implementation services with post-implementation customer support. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using its best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which the Company estimates its expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. The Company also uses the adjusted market approach whereby it estimates the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract. Certain of the Company s software implementation performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, typically when customer acceptance is obtained. When evaluating the transaction price, the Company analyzes, on a contract-by-contract basis, all applicable variable consideration. The nature of the Company s contracts gives rise to variable consideration, including volume discounts, contract penalties, and other similar items that generally decrease the transaction price. The Company estimates these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized. The Company does not anticipate significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration. The Company includes reimbursements from customers, such as postage costs, in revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of revenue.

The undiscounted cash flows associated with the April 2026 Notes issued were compared to the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes and since the undiscounted cash flows of the April 2026 Notes exceeded the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes, the carrying value of the April 2026 Notes was established at the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes and the Company established new effective interest rates based on the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes prior to the 2023 Exchange.

In addition, all of the collateral securing the July 2026 Notes was released pursuant to the seventh supplemental indenture. The July 11, 2023 transaction resulted in cancellation of debt income CODI for tax purposes. Absent an exception, a debtor recognizes CODI upon discharge of its outstanding indebtedness for an amount of consideration that is less than the outstanding debt. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code ), provides that a debtor may wholly or partially exclude CODI from taxable income but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of CODI excluded from taxable income. Pursuant to the U.S. tax rules, the Company computes the final CODI calculation based on the tax basis as of the last day of the fiscal tax year (i.e., December 31, 2023) which includes the date in which the debt transaction occurred. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company generated CODI in the amount of million, of which million was included in the fiscal year 2023 taxable income and million was excluded from taxable income, resulting in the elimination of million gross federal and state net operating losses.

 We believe our process expertise, information technology capabilities and operational insights enable our customers organizations to more efficiently and effectively execute transactions, make decisions, drive revenue and profitability, and communicate critical information to their employees, customers, partners, and vendors. Our solutions are location agnostic, and we believe the combination of our hybrid hosted solutions and global work force in the Americas, EMEA and Asia offers meaningful differentiation in the industries we serve and services we provide. History We are a former special purpose acquisition company that completed our initial public offering on January 22, 2015. In July 2017, Exela, formerly known as Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2 Quinpario ), completed its acquisition of SourceHOV Holdings, Inc. SourceHOV and Novitex Holdings, Inc. Novitex pursuant to a business combination agreement dated February 21, 2017 Novitex Business Combination ). In conjunction with the completion of the Novitex Business Combination, Quinpario was renamed Exela Technologies, Inc. The Novitex Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger for which SourceHOV was determined to be the accounting acquirer. Outstanding shares of SourceHOV were converted into shares of our common stock Common Stock ), presented as a recapitalization, and the net assets of Quinpario were acquired at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The acquisition of Novitex was treated as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 and was accounted for using the acquisition method. The strategic combination of SourceHOV and Novitex formed Exela, which is one of the largest global providers of information processing solutions based on revenues. On November 29, 2023, we completed the merger of our European business with CF Acquisition Corp. VIII. After this merger, our European business operates as XBP Europe Holdings, Inc. XBP Europe ), a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Beginning on November 30, 2023, XBP Europe shares and warrants started trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbols XBP XBPEW, respectively. We own a majority of the outstanding capital stock of XBP Europe. Sale of Non-core Assets On June 8, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its high-speed scanner business for a purchase price of approximately 30.1 million. As a result of this transaction, the Company disposed of 16.5 million of goodwill based on the relative fair value of the high-speed scanner business to the total fair value of the ITPS reporting unit. This transaction resulted in a total pre-tax gain of 7.2 million. Per the terms of the sales agreement, the Company may receive additional cash consideration upon the future occurrence of certain earn-out events described in the sales agreement. Recent Developments As previously disclosed, we were notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq that we were in violation of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) because our Market Value of Listed Securities was below the minimum requirement of 35 million for 30 consecutive business days and we failed to satisfy any of the alternative requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b). After we requested an appeal hearing, which stayed the delisting action, we were unable to regain compliance by November 1, 2024, which is the deadline that was set by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). On November 6, 2024, Nasdaq notified us that the Panel had determined to delist our common stock and that trading of our securities would be suspended at the open of trading on November 8, 2024. Nasdaq will file a Form 25 with the SEC notifying the SEC of Nasdaq s determination to remove our securities from listing on Nasdaq. We will remain subject to SEC reporting obligations. As a result of the delisting, our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock began trading on the OTC Pink under the symbols XELA and XELAP on November 8, 2024, and such market is currently the only trading market for our securities. We anticipate that Nasdaq will soon file a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to formally remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq, although the exact timing of such filing is currently unknown.

 EBITDA; and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Revenue by segment We analyze our revenue by comparing actual monthly revenue to internal projections and prior periods across our operating segments in order to assess performance, identify potential areas for improvement, and determine whether our segments are meeting management s expectations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA We view EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as important indicators of performance of our consolidated operations. We define EBITDA as net loss, plus income tax expense, interest expense, net, and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus transaction and integration costs; non cash equity compensation, (gain) or loss from sale or disposal of assets or business, non-recurring charges and impairment charges; and other infrequent, or unusual costs and expenses. See Other Financial Information (Non GAAP Financial Measures) for more information and a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

The revenue changes by reporting segment were as follows: ITPS For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue attributable to our ITPS segment increased by 19.8 million, or 11.5 compared to the same period in the prior year. The majority of this revenue growth is attributable to existing contracts and statements of work from certain customers. The reported ITPS segment revenue increased by 0.7 million from currency conversion during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. HS For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue attributable to our HS segment decreased by 3.3 million, or 5.3 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower volume from existing customers. LLPS For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue attributable to our LLPS segment decreased by 0.5 million, or 2.4 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an decrease in project based engagements in legal claims administration services. Cost of Revenue For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of revenue increased by 16.5 million, or 8.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Costs in our ITPS segment increased by 18.2 million, or 12.9 , primarily attributable to the corresponding growth in revenues. HS segment costs decreased by 3.4 million, or 7.4 , primarily due to decrease in employee-related cost. LLPS segment cost of revenue increased by 1.6 million, or 14.2 , primarily attributable to the increase in employee related cost. The increase in cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was primarily due to a increase in postage cost of 30.0 million and other operating costs of 2.2 million, offset by lower employee-related costs of 13.2 million and lower infrastructure and maintenance costs of 2.6 million. Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 79.8 of revenue compared to the 78.4 for the comparable same period in the prior year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A expenses decreased 0.3 million, or 0.8 , to 35.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 35.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower legal and professional fees of 3.5 million, 3.5 million in business interruption insurance recoveries offset by higher infrastructure, maintenance and operating costs of 1.1 million, higher employee related costs by 1.6 million, higher bad debts provisions by 2.0 million, higher other SG A expenses of 1.8 million and higher travel cost by 0.2 million.

The loss on early extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.3 million and is inclusive of 0.3 million write off of debt issuance costs.

The tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is higher than the three months ended September 30, 2023 largely due to a remeasurement of existing uncertain tax positions in Canada and Germany, an increase in U.S. taxes in current period due to loss of U.S. tax attributes partially offset by decrease in foreign tax due decrease in Canadian tax expense from prior period. Our estimated annual effective tax rate of (23.6) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the expected U.S. statutory tax rate of 21.0 and was primarily impacted by permanent tax adjustments, state and local current expense, foreign operations, remeasurement of existing uncertain tax positions in Canada and Germany and valuation allowances, including valuation allowances on a portion of our deferred tax assets on U.S. disallowed interest expense carryforwards under by the provisions of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA ).

We experienced revenue decline in ITPS and HS segments and revenue growth in LLPS segment. Our ITPS, HS, and LLPS segments constituted 67.9 , 24.1 , and 8.0 of total revenue, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 68.9 , 23.6 , and 7.5 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue changes by reporting segment were as follows: ITPS For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue attributable to our ITPS segment decreased by 25.9 million, or 4.7 compared to the same period in the prior year. The majority of this revenue decline is attributable to exiting contracts and statements of work from certain customers with revenue that we believe was unpredictable, non-recurring and were not a strategic fit to our long-term success. In June 2023, we sold our high-speed scanner business and this resulted in 5.5 million lower revenue in the current period as compared to the period ended September 30, 2023. The reported ITPS segment revenue benefited by 1.0 million from currency conversion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. HS For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue attributable to our HS segment decreased by 2.2 million, or 1.2 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower volumes from our new and existing healthcare customers.

The decrease in total depreciation and amortization expenses by 4.3 million was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of the expiration of the lives of assets acquired in prior periods and decrease in intangibles amortization expense due to end of useful lives for certain intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The gain on early extinguishment of debt for the 2023 Term Loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 7.1 million and is inclusive of less than 0.1 million write off of original issue discount and debt issuance costs.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid 1.6 million of exit fees on the partial prepayment of the BRCC Term Loan (as defined and further described in Indebtedness below) which was treated as a debt extinguishment cost. Sundry Expense, net The decrease in sundry expense, net by 0.8 million over the prior year period was primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations on foreign currency transactions. Other Income, net Other income, net was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other income, net of 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income Tax Expense We recorded an income tax expense of 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an income tax expense of 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is increased as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is largely due to a remeasurement of existing uncertain tax positions in Canada and Germany as well as an increase in U.S. tax due to loss of attributes partially offset by the decrease in foreign earnings which is largely driven by decrease in Canadian tax expense in prior year. Our estimated annual effective tax rate of (14.7) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the expected U.S. statutory tax rate of 21.0 and was primarily impacted by permanent tax adjustments, state and local current expense, foreign operations, remeasurement of existing uncertain tax positions in Canada and Germany and valuation allowances, including valuation allowances on a portion of our deferred tax assets on U.S. disallowed interest expense carryforwards under the provisions of the TCJA. Other Financial Information (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) We view EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as important indicators of performance. We define EBITDA as net (loss) or income, plus income tax expense, interest expense, net, and depreciation and amortization. We have historically defined Adjusted EBITDA, including in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as EBITDA plus optimization and restructuring charges, including severance and retention expenses; transaction and integration costs; other non-cash charges, including non-cash compensation, (gain) or loss from sale or disposal of assets, and impairment charges; and management fees and expenses consistent with the definitions contained in our debt agreements. Beginning with the 2023 Form 10-K, the Company has made certain changes to the way it defines Adjusted EBITDA that impact the comparability of the metrics to prior periods. Specifically, the Company will no longer include optimization and restructuring expenses, contract costs and certain other charges that we historically added back to our computation of Adjusted EBITDA consistent with the definitions in our debt agreements. The Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA for the same period in the prior year also reflects this updated definition of Adjusted EBITDA (i.e., will not be the same as set forth in prior filings due to the change of definition). We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP.

 Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance and results of operations as our Board and management use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance, because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of our management team. Net loss is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our non GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures are not required to be uniformly applied, are not audited and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Under ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), the Company has the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The following conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern: a history of continuing net losses, net operating cash outflows, working capital deficits and accumulated deficit. Going concern matters are more fully discussed in Note 1, General of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Liquidity is the availability of adequate amounts of cash with an enterprise to meet its needs for cash requirements. At September 30, 2024, cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and cash included in assets of disposal group held for sale totaled 45.6 million, including restricted cash of 34.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, our working capital deficit amounted to 262.8 million, an increase of 49.1 million as compared to working capital deficit of 213.7 million as of December 31, 2023 mainly due to current maturities of our long term debts. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. These obligations include borrowings, interest obligations, purchase commitments, operating and finance lease commitments, employee benefit payments and taxes. Specifically, 5.9 million outstanding under the BRCC Revolver (as defined and described further in the description of Indebtedness below) is payable in two (2) monthly installments of 2.0 million in November 2024 and December 2024, with the remaining outstanding principal balance of 1.9 million payable on January 31, 2025. The current maturities under the Senior Secured Term Loan, the Second Lien Note, the secured borrowings under the BR Exar AR Facility (as defined and further described in Indebtedness below)

 and the other debts are 2.0 million, 27.5 million, 8.7 million and 9.8 million, respectively. See Note 5 Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities , Note 7 Employee Benefit Plans , and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies, to our condensed consolidated financial statements herein for further information on material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations. We plan to spend approximately 1.2 of total revenue on total capital expenditures over the next twelve months. Our business model has evolved to leverage cloud hosted platforms. This has reduced our capital expenditures and increased our operating expenses. This is the primary driver of changes in our capital expenditures when compared with historical periods. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, our investments in strategic initiatives, applications or technologies, operation centers and acquisition of complementary businesses, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all, which may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The Company has implemented favorable provisions of the CARES Act, including the refundable payroll tax credits and the deferment of employer social security payments. At the end of 2021, the Company paid a portion of the deferred employer social security due as per Internal Revenue Service s guidance. The remaining balance of deferred employer social security taxes will need to be paid by fiscal year 2024. The Company similarly used COVID-19 relief measures in various European jurisdictions, including permitted deferrals of certain payroll, social security and value added taxes. At the end of 2021, the Company paid a portion of these deferred payroll taxes, social security and value added taxes. The remaining balance of European deferred payroll taxes, social security and value added taxes will need to be paid by April 2027 as per deferment timeline. The Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement (as defined and described further in the description of Indebtedness below) entered into on June 17, 2022 provides us access to liquidity through the sale of receivables. Under the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement, transfers of accounts receivable are treated as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the accounts receivable to the purchasers of the receivables. The Company de-recognized 126.5 million and 377.1 million of accounts receivable under this agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company de-recognized 119.3 million and 382.2 million of accounts receivable under this agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The amount remitted to the Purchasers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 127.7 million and 377.0 million, respectively. The amount remitted to the Purchasers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 119.0 and 385.5 million, respectively. Unsold accounts receivable of 29.0 million and 41.2 million were pledged by the SPEs as collateral to the Purchasers as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. With an objective to increase free cash flows and in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to support profitable growth, the Company is pursuing further reduction in debt and repricing of existing debt. The Company will continue to pursue the sale of certain non-core businesses that are not central to the Company s long-term strategic vision and invest in the acquisition of businesses that enhance the value proposition. The Company also plans to take further action to raise additional funds in the debt and equity capital markets. There can be no assurances, however, that any of these initiatives will be consummated or will achieve its desired result.

 Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash used in operating activities (12,218) (37,972) 25,754 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (5,766) 21,259 (27,025) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (3,703) 17,193 (20,896) Subtotal (21,687) 480 (22,167) Effect of exchange rates on cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and cash included in assets of disposal group held for sale 148 (53) 201 Net (decrease) increase in cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and cash included in assets of disposal group held for sale (21,539) 427 (21,966) Analysis of Cash Flow Changes between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Operating Activities The decrease of 25.8 million in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to improvement in debt amortization cost by 40.5 million, lower cost of revenue, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, improvement in operating cycle for accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. This increase in cash generated in operating activities was partially offset by lower realization from prepaid expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Investing Activities The decrease of 27.0 million in net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to sale of our high-speed scanner business during the nine months ended September 2023. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.7 million, primarily as a result of 45.4 million of proceeds from borrowings under the BR Exar AR Facility and net proceeds of 38.0 million from other loans, 0.5 million proceeds from issuance of April 2026 notes offset by 43.3 million of principal repayments on Senior Secured Term Loans, Second Lien Notes, BRCC Revolver and other loans, 37.5 million of repayment under the BR Exar AR Facility and 1.1 million for payment for debt issuance cost. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 17.2 million, primarily as a result of 67.0 million of net proceeds from equity offerings, 31.5 million of proceeds from the Second Lien Note, 20.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the BR Exar AR Facility, 9.6 million of proceeds from borrowings under the BRCC Revolver, 40.0 million of proceeds from Senior Secured Term Loan and net proceeds of 21.8 million from other loans which is offset by debt issuance costs of 8.3 million, repayments on the BRCC Facility, senior secured term loans, factoring arrangement and other loans of 125.9 million, 23.2 million of repayment under the BR Exar AR Facility and cash outflow of 11.9 million for debt repurchases. Indebtedness Following is a description of the Company s key indebtedness. July 2026 Notes As of January 1, 2023, there was outstanding 980.0 million aggregate principal amount of 11.5 First-Priority Senior Secured Notes scheduled to mature July 15, 2026 (the July 2026 Notes issued by Exela Intermediate LLC and Exela Finance Inc. (together, the Issuers ), wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. The July 2026 Notes are guaranteed by nearly all U.S. subsidiaries of Exela Intermediate LLC. The July 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 11.5 per year. We are required to pay interest on the July 2026 Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, and commenced making such interest payments on July 15, 2022. The Issuers may redeem the July 2026 Notes in whole or 

 51 

Table of Contents 
 in part from time to time, at a redemption price of 100 , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. On July 11, 2023, the Issuers, certain guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee, entered into an indenture (the April 2026 Notes Indenture governing the 11.5 First-Priority Senior Secured Notes scheduled to mature July 12, 2026 (the April 2026 Notes ), and the Issuers issued approximately 764.8 million aggregate principal amount of the April 2026 Notes as consideration for the exchange of 956.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuers existing July 2026 Notes pursuant to a public exchange offer (the 2023 Exchange ), which was equivalent to issuing 800 of the April 2026 Notes per 1,000 principal amount of the existing July 2026 Notes. The Company performed an assessment of the 2023 Exchange and determined that it met the criteria to be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470-60. The undiscounted cash flows associated with the April 2026 Notes issued were compared to the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes and since the undiscounted cash flows of the April 2026 Notes exceeded the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes, the carrying value of the April 2026 Notes was established at the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes and the Company established new effective interest rates based on the carrying value of the exchanged July 2026 Notes prior to the 2023 Exchange. The difference between the principal amount of the issued April 2026 Notes and their carrying value was recorded as a premium and is included in long-term debt on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded a premium of 142.3 million on the notes exchange, which will be reduced as contractual interest payments are made on the April 2026 Notes. On July 11, 2023, the Company entered into a seventh supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the July 2026 Notes which eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants, eliminated certain events of default, modified covenants regarding mergers and consolidations and modified or eliminated certain other provisions, including certain provisions relating to future guarantors and defeasance, contained in the July 2026 Notes Indenture and the July 2026 Notes. In addition, all of the collateral securing the July 2026 Notes was released pursuant to the seventh supplemental indenture. The July 11, 2023 transaction resulted in cancellation of debt income CODI for tax purposes. Absent an exception, a debtor recognizes CODI upon discharge of its outstanding indebtedness for an amount of consideration that is less than the outstanding debt. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code ), provides that a debtor may wholly or partially exclude CODI from taxable income but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of CODI excluded from taxable income. Pursuant to the U.S. tax rules, the Company computes the final CODI calculation based on the tax basis as of the last day of the fiscal tax year (i.e., December 31, 2023) which includes the date in which the debt transaction occurred. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company generated CODI in the amount of 780.0 million, of which 54.0 million was included in the fiscal year 2023 taxable income and 726.0 million was excluded from taxable income, resulting in the elimination of 624.0 million gross federal and state net operating losses. As a result of the 2023 Exchange and periodic repurchases (as discussed below), 24.0 million aggregate principal amount of the July 2026 Notes maturing July 15, 2026 remained outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Senior Secured April 2026 Notes On July 11, 2023, the Issuers issued approximately 767.8 million aggregate principal amount of the April 2026 Notes under the April 2026 Notes Indenture, which includes the April 2026 Notes issued pursuant to the 2023 Exchange (as described above) and 3.0 million issued in exchange of other indebtedness. The April 2026 Notes are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2026. Interest on the April 2026 Notes will accrue at 11.5 per annum and will be paid semi-annually, in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2023. Interest will be payable in cash or in kind by issuing additional April 2026 Notes (or increasing the principal amount of the outstanding April 2026 Notes) PIK Interest as described below: (A) for the July 15, 2023 interest payment date, such interest was paid in kind as PIK Interest, (B) for each interest payment date from and including the January 15, 2024 interest payment date through and including the July 15, 2024 interest payment date, such interest shall be paid in cash in an amount equal to (i) 50 of such interest plus (ii) an amount not to exceed an amount that, pro forma for such payment, would leave the issuers with Unrestricted Cash (as 

 52

 defined in the April 2026 Notes Indenture) of at least 15.0 million, with the remaining interest paid in kind as PIK Interest, and (C) for interest payment dates falling on or after January 15, 2025, such interest shall be paid in cash. On July 15, 2023, the Company issued 44.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the April 2026 Notes as a payment for PIK Interest that would otherwise have been due to holders of the July 2026 Notes that participated in the 2023 Exchange.

The Issuers obligations under the April 2026 Notes and the April 2026 Notes Indenture are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the same guarantors (the Guarantors that guarantee the July 2026 Notes (other than certain guarantors that have ceased to have operations or assets) and by certain of the Issuers other affiliates (the Affiliated Guarantors ). The April 2026 Notes and the related guarantees are first-priority senior secured obligations of the Issuers, the Guarantors and Affiliated Guarantors. The issuers may redeem the April 2026 Notes at their option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price of 100 , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, the April 2026 Notes will be mandatorily redeemable in part upon the sale of certain assets that constitute additional credit support. The April 2026 Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit the Issuers and the Affiliated Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries ability to, among other things, (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock and make other restricted payments, (iii) make investments, (iv) consummate certain asset sales, (v) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (vi) grant or assume certain liens and (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. In addition, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, the Issuers must offer to repurchase the April 2026 Notes at 101 of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. The April 2026 Notes Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all of the then outstanding April 2026 Notes to be due and payable immediately. 2023 Term loan During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the private exchange, repurchases (as discussed below) and periodic principal repayments, 48.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Term Loans were outstanding as of July 11, 2023, the date the Company fully repaid and discharged the remaining outstanding balance of the 2023 Term Loans by making a cash payment of 44.8 million and by issuance of 3.0 million principal amount of Senior Secured April 2026 Notes.

BRCC Facility On November 17, 2021, GP2 XCV, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company GP2 XCV ), entered into a borrowing facility with B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC (which was subsequently assigned to BRF Finance Co., LLC BRF Finance )) pursuant to which such subsidiary was able to borrow an original principal amount of 75.0 million, which was later increased to 115.0 million as of December 7, 2021 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the BRCC Term Loan ). On March 31, 2022, GP2 XCV and B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC amended this facility to permit GP2 XCV to borrow up to 51.0 million under a separate revolving loan (the BRCC Revolver , collectively with the BRCC Term Loan, the BRCC Facility ). The BRCC Facility is secured by a lien on all the assets of GP2 XCV and by a pledge of the equity of GP2 XCV.

On January 12, 2024, 1.0 million of certain waiver and consent fees payable by subsidiaries of the Company under the term of Senior Secured Term Loan were added to outstanding balance of the Senior Secured Term Loan. The Senior Secured Term Loan shall be, at the option of the Company, either a Reference Rate Loan, or a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR Loan. Each portion of the Senior Secured Term Loan that is a Reference Rate Loan bears interest on the principal amount outstanding from the date of the Senior Secured Term Loan until repaid, at a rate per annum equal to the Reference Rate plus the Applicable Margin. Reference Rate for any period means the greatest of (i) 4.00 per annum, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 per annum, (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR (which rate shall be calculated based upon an interest period of 1 month and shall be determined on a daily basis) plus 1.00 per annum, and (iv) the rate last quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the "Prime Rate" in the United States. Applicable Margin, with respect to the interest rate of (a) any Reference Rate Loan is 10.39 per annum, and (b) any SOFR Rate Loan is 11.39 per annum. SOFR Rate Loans shall bear interest on the principal amount outstanding, at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR rate for the Interest Period in effect for the Term Loan plus Applicable Margin. Adjusted Term SOFR means the rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for such calculation, plus 0.26161 . Term SOFR, for calculation with respect to a SOFR Rate Loan, is the per annum forward-looking term rate based on secured overnight financing rate for a tenor comparable to the applicable interest period on the day that is two business days prior to the first day of such interest period. However, with respect to a Reference Rate Loan, Term SOFR means the per annum forward-looking term rate based on secured overnight financing rate for a tenor of three months on the

 day that is two business days prior to such day. If Term SOFR as so determined shall ever be less than 4.00 , then Term SOFR shall be deemed to be 4.00 . The Company may, at any time, elect to have interest on all or a portion of the loans be charged at a rate of interest based upon Term SOFR (the SOFR Option by notifying the administrative agent at least three (3) business days prior to the proposed change.

If optional prepayment is made after the year one anniversary of the borrowing date to the date of the two-year anniversary (the Second Period ), the applicable premium shall be an amount equal to 1 times the amount of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan being paid on such date. The applicable premium shall be zero in case of prepayment after the date of the two-year anniversary of the borrowing date. Further, during the Second Period, if the prepayment is because of an event of default or termination of contract for any reason, the applicable premium shall be 1 times the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan outstanding on such date. The Senior Secured Term Loan contains customary events of default, cross-default provisions, affirmative and negative covenants, including limitation on the Company s and certain of its subsidiaries ability to create, incur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; make any restricted payments; undergo fundamental changes, as well as certain financial covenants. The cross-default provisions are triggered if the parent, borrower, affiliates, or significant subsidiaries defaults on any debt that is greater than 25 million if the effect of such default or event is to (i) accelerate, or to permit the acceleration of, the maturity of such indebtedness; (ii) allow such indebtedness to be declared due and payable or (iii) required such indebtedness to be prepaid (other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment) or redeemed, in each case, prior to the stated maturity thereof. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. Securitization Facility On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated receivables purchase agreement (as amended, the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement under an existing 150.0 million securitization facility (the Securitization Facility among certain of the Company s subsidiaries, Exela Receivables 3, LLC (the Securitization Borrower ), Exela Receivables 3 Holdco, LLC (the Securitization Parent SPE, and together with the Securitization Borrower, the SPEs and certain global financial institutions (the Purchasers ). The Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement extended the term of the Securitization Facility such that the SPEs may sell certain accounts receivable to the Purchasers until June 17, 2025. Under the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement, transfers of accounts receivable from the SPEs are treated as sales and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable, because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the accounts receivable to the Purchasers. The Company and related subsidiaries have no continuing involvement in the transferred accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities, and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors of the Company, the operating subsidiaries of the Company that agreed to sell receivables in connection with the Securitization Facility (the Securitization Originators ), or any other relevant subsidiaries.

 The sales of accounts receivable under the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement are transacted at 100 of the face value of the relevant accounts receivable, resulting in derecognition of the accounts receivable from the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company de-recognized 126.5 million and 377.1 million of accounts receivable under this agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company de-recognized 119.3 million and 382.2 million of accounts receivable under this agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The amount remitted to the Purchasers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 127.7 million and 377.0 million, respectively. The amount remitted to the Purchasers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 119.0 and 385.5 million, respectively. Unsold accounts receivable of 29.0 million and 41.2 million were pledged by the SPEs as collateral to the Purchasers as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The program resulted in a pre-tax loss of 2.4 million and 6.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The program resulted in a pre-tax loss of 2.0 million and 5.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. BR Exar AR Facility On February 12, 2024, certain of the Company s subsidiaries entered into a receivables purchase agreement with BR Exar, LLC BREL ), an affiliate of B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC (as subsequently amended on February 29, 2024, March 29, 2024, March 31, 2024, April 24, 2024, May 24, 2024 and June 25, 2024, July 29, 2024, August 13, 2024, August 30, 2024 and September 27, 2024 the BR Exar AR Facility ). The Company received an aggregate of 45.0 million, net of legal and other fees of 0.4 million, under the BR Exar AR Facility. Under the terms of the BR Exar AR Facility, certain of the Company s subsidiaries agreed to sell certain existing receivables and all of their future receivables to BREL until such time as BREL shall have collected 50.0 million, net of any costs, expenses or other amounts paid to or owing to the buyer under the agreement. BREL collected 41.3 million under the BR Exar AR Facility during the period from February 2024 to September 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there was a 8.7 million outstanding balance under the BR Exar AR Facility. Second Lien Note On February 27, 2023, the SPEs and B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC entered into a new Secured Promissory Note (which was subsequently assigned to BRF Finance) pursuant to which B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC agreed to lend up to 35.0 million secured by a second lien pledge of the Securitization Borrower (the Second Lien Note ). The Second Lien Note is scheduled to mature on June 17, 2025 and bears interest at a per annum rate of one-month Term SOFR plus 7.5 . The SPEs are party to the Amended Receivables Purchase Agreement, thus the transactions necessitated amendments to that agreement and related documents to permit the addition of subordinated debt and additional borrowing capacity into that transaction structure, in addition to providing for a 5.0 million fee to the lenders for facilitating the transaction. In connection with the above-described facility, we also amended the BRCC Term Loan and BRCC Revolver to provide for 9.6 million of borrowing capacity, which was drawn as described above. As of September 30, 2024, there were borrowings of 27.5 million outstanding under the Second Lien Note payable at maturity. Potential Future Transactions We may, from time to time explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions, which may include joint ventures, as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets. In order to pursue certain of these opportunities, additional funds will likely be required. Subject to applicable contractual restrictions, to obtain such financing, we may seek to use cash on hand, or we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing through private placements or through underwritten offerings. There can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances, nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for transactions that require additional funds on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, pursuant to registration rights agreements that we have entered into, or may enter into in the future, certain of our stockholders may have the right to demand underwritten offerings of our Common Stock. We may from time to time in the future explore, with certain of those stockholders the possibility of an underwritten public offering of our Common Stock held by those stockholders. There can be no assurance as to whether or when such transactions may be commenced or completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering.

 On July 1, 2024, the Company had announced that its Board had authorized the Company to consider a spin-off of its wholly-owned subsidiary Exela Technologies BPA, LLC (the holding company for the Company s business process automation business which includes our HS and LLPS segments and part of our ITPS segment, and collectively with all of its subsidiaries, the BPA Business ). However, this spin-off plan has now been abandoned by the Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. Our critical accounting policies and estimates provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimations and how they can impact our financial statements. A critical accounting estimate is one that requires subjective or complex estimates and assessments, and is fundamental to our results of operations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the current assumptions, judgments and estimates used to determine amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate; however, actual results may differ under different conditions. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this document. Refer to "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" contained in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company s market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the 2023 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that are described in the 2023 Form 10-K. Notwithstanding such material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our management, including our Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our condensed consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this quarterly report, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 Remediation As previously described in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures of the 2023 Form 10-K, we continue to implement a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses mentioned above. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Derivative Actions On July 8, 2020, Plaintiff Gregory McKenna filed a shareholder derivative action asserting the following claims against current and former directors and officers of Exela: (1) Violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act; (2) Violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act; (3) Violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; (5) unjust enrichment; and (6) waste of corporate assets. On December 21, 2020, Plaintiffs Richard W. Moser and Jonathan Gonzalez filed a substantially similar shareholder derivative action, which has been consolidated with the McKenna action. The claims stem from substantially the same factual allegations relating to the Company s 2020 restatement of its financial statements for 2017, 2018 and interim periods through September 30, 2019 that were the subject of the Shen securities class action lawsuit which was settled in December 2023. These claims were not discharged by the settlement, however, and at this time, it is not practicable to render an opinion about whether an unfavorable outcome is probable or remote with respect to this matter; however, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses. Business Interruption Insurance Claim During the second half of 2022, the Company experienced a network security incident (the 2022 Network Outage impacting certain of the Company s operational and information technology systems. As a result of the 2022 Network Outage, the Company experienced lost revenue and incurred certain incremental costs. On August 29, 2023, the Company submitted a claim to its insurers for 44.6 million in covered losses related to the 2022 Network Outage (the August 2023 Claim ). During the year 2023, the Company received insurance proceeds of 10.8 million in respect of business interruption claims from its underlying and first excess carriers. On April 17, 2024, the Company commenced an action (the Insurance Lawsuit against two excess-layer insurers (collectively, the Second Excess Insurers seeking a declaratory judgment and alleging breach of contract and bad faith for failing to pay out their share of losses connected to the August 2023 Claim. On August 9, 2024, the Company settled its claim against one of the Second Excess Insurers for 3.6 million, and on October 15, 2024, the Company settled its claim against the other Second Excess Insurers for 3.6 million (less amounts already paid). On October 8, 2024, the Company moved to amend the complaint (the Amended Complaint to add two additional excess-layer insurers to the Insurance Lawsuit. The Amended Complaint was filed on October 24, 2024. At this time, it is not practicable to render an opinion regarding the outcome of this matter; however, the Company believes it has meritorious claims and plans to vigorously assert them. Network Outage SEC Matter On November 12, 2024, the SEC Staff informed the Company that they intend to open an investigation concerning the previously disclosed network outage that the Company experienced in the summer of 2022. The Company has been responding to informal questions from the SEC Staff relating to that outage since July 2024, and will fully cooperate with the investigation. The Company believes it has acted properly, but at this early stage, it is not possible to predict the areas or outcome of the investigation. Other We are, from time to time, involved in other legal proceedings, inquiries, claims and disputes, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Although our management cannot predict the outcomes of these matters, our management believes these actions will not have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Except for the risk factor included below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10 K and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

 quarterly period ended June 30, 2024. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Our securities have been delisted from Nasdaq and experience the risks of trading in an over-the-counter market. On November 6, 2024, we received written notification from Nasdaq that they would suspend trading of our common stock and Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock (formerly Nasdaq: XELA and XELAP) on November 8, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC to delist such securities from Nasdaq. We will remain subject to SEC reporting obligations. As a result of the suspension and delisting, our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock began trading on the OTC Pink under the symbols XELA and XELAP on November 8, 2024, and such market is currently the only trading market for our securities. We anticipate that Nasdaq will soon file a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to formally remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq, although the exact timing of such filing is currently unknown.We can provide no assurance that our securities will continue to trade on OTC Pink, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our securities on OTC Pink, whether the trading volume of our securities on OTC Pink will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for our securities will continue on OTC Pink in the future, which could result in significantly lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity for investors seeking to buy or sell our securities. In addition, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in addition to negative perceptions about us and our business that may result from delisting. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. On August 10, 2022, the Board authorized a share buyback program (the 2022 Share Buyback Program ), pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 50,000 shares of the Common Stock over a two-year period through various means, including, open market transactions and privately negotiated transactions. The 2022 Share Buyback Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares. The decision as to whether to repurchase any shares and the timing of repurchases will be based on the price of the Common Stock, general business and market conditions and other investment considerations and factors. No shares were repurchased under the 2022 Share Buyback Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased and concurrently retired a total of 1,787 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2022 Share Buyback Program. Share repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows: 

Total Number Maximum of Shares Number of Purchased as Shares that Part of May Yet Be Average Publicly Purchased Number Price Announced Under the of Shares Paid per Plans or Plans or Period Purchased Share Programs Programs July 1, 2024-July 31, 2024 48,213 August 1, 2024-August 31, 2024 48,213 September 1, 2024-September 30, 2024 48,213 Total Item 3.
