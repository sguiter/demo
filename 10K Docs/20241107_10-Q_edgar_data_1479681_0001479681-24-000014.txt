The shares and the warrants were issued separately and issued on a -to-one ratio at a public offering price of per share and accompanying warrant prior to the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits). The Warrants have an exercise price of per share prior to the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits), are exercisable immediately upon issuance and expire from the Closing Date. The Warrants may only be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for, the issuance or resale of shares of common stock underlying the Warrants to or by the holder.

For each exercise, the Company remeasured the Warrants based on the exercise date, recognized a gain or loss on warrant liability, and allocated the exercised portion of the warrant liability to additional paid-in capital. The Company remeasured the Warrants on September 30, 2024, recognizing the fair value of

Explanatory Note On April 1, 2022 (the Merger Date ), Nutex Health Holdco LLC and Clinigence Holdings, Inc. Clinigence completed the merger (the Merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement dated as of November 23, 2021 between Clinigence, Nutex Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Clinigence, Nutex, Micro Hospital Holding LLC (solely for the purposes of certain sections of the Merger Agreement), Nutex Health Holdco LLC and Thomas Vo, M.D., solely in his capacity as the representative of the equity holders of Nutex. Immediately following the completion of the Merger, Clinigence amended its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to change its name to Nutex Health Inc. In connection with the Merger, each outstanding equity interest of Nutex Health Holdco LLC was exchanged for 3.571428575 shares of Clinigence common stock. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse business combination under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Nutex Health Holdco LLC was treated as the accounting acquirer in the Merger. Our financial statements presented for periods prior to the Merger Date are those of Nutex Health Holdco, LLC, as the Company s predecessor entity. Beginning with the second quarter of 2022, our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include Clinigence. Except where the context indicates otherwise, (i) references to we, us, our, or the Company refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Merger, to Nutex Health Holdco LLC and its subsidiaries, (ii) references the Nutex Health for periods following the completion of the Merger, refer to Nutex Health Inc. and its subsidiaries and (iii) references to Clinigence refer to Clinigence Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the completion of the Merger. Overview Nutex Health Inc. is a physician-led, healthcare services and operations company with 22 hospital facilities in ten states (hospital division), and a primary care-centric, risk-bearing population health management division. Our hospital division implements and operates different innovative health care models, including micro-hospitals, specialty hospitals and hospital outpatient departments HOPDs ). The population health management division owns and operates provider networks such as independent physician associations IPAs ). We employ approximately 800 full time employees, contract 230 doctors at our facilities and partner with over 1,700 physicians within our networks. Our corporate headquarters is based in Houston, Texas. We were incorporated on April 13, 2000 in the state of Delaware. Our financial statements present the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations including those of majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary. The hospital division includes our healthcare hospital management platform, billing and collections organization and hospital entities. In addition, we have financial and operating relationships with multiple professional entities (the Physician LLCs and real estate entities (the Real Estate Entities ). The Physician LLCs employ the doctors who work in our hospitals. These entities are consolidated by the Company as VIEs because they do not have significant equity at risk, and we have historically provided support to the Physician LLCs in the event of cash shortages and received the benefit of their cash surpluses. The Real Estate Entities own the land and hospital buildings which are leased to our hospital entities. The Real Estate Entities have mortgage loans payable to third parties which are collateralized by the land and buildings. We consolidate the Real Estate Entities as VIEs in instances where our hospital entities are guarantors or co-borrowers under their outstanding mortgage loans. Since the second quarter of 2022, we deconsolidated 18 Real Estate Entities after the third-party lenders released our guarantees of associated mortgage loans.

The population health management division includes our management services organization. Additionally, the population health management division owns and operates provider networks such as independent physician associations IPAs ). IPAs not owned by us are consolidated as VIEs because we are the primary beneficiary of these IPAs operations and have 100 control of these IPAs operations through management services agreements with each applicable IPA. Sources of revenue . Our hospital division recognizes net patient service revenue for contracts with patients and in most cases a third-party payor (commercial insurance, workers compensation insurance or, in limited cases, Medicare/Medicaid). We receive payment for facility services rendered by us from federal agencies, private insurance carriers, and patients. The Physician LLCs receive payment for doctor services from these same sources. On average, greater than 90 of our net patient service revenue is paid by insurers, federal agencies, and other non-patient third parties. The remaining revenue is paid by our patients in the form of copays, deductibles, and self-payment. The following tables present the allocation of the estimated transaction price with the patient between the primary patient classification of insurance coverage:

Capitation revenue consists primarily of capitated fees for medical services provided by physician-owned entities we consolidate as VIEs. Capitated arrangements are made directly with various managed care providers including HMOs. Capitation revenues are typically prepaid monthly to us based on the number of enrollees selecting us as their healthcare provider. Capitation is a fixed payment amount per patient per unit of time paid in advance for the delivery of health care services, whereby the service providers are generally liable for excess medical costs. We receive management fees that are received based on gross capitation revenues of the IPAs or physician groups we manage. Our growth plans. We plan to expand our operations by entering new market areas either through the development of new hospitals, formation of new IPAs or by making acquisitions. We identify new market areas for hospitals based on the area s need for access to emergency health services and growth expectations. We identify and partner with local physicians who will operate and manage the new location in conjunction with our internal management team. When developing new hospitals, we have a turn-key process for location selection, real estate acquisition, design, and development of the facility including staffing, training and operations. We extend our existing comprehensive suite of centralized services to operating hospitals, including executive management, billing, collections, recruiting, human resources, legal and marketing.

 Overview of Legislative Developments The U.S. Congress and many state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that have impacted access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Affordable Care Act , affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act increased health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. There is uncertainty regarding the ongoing net effect of the Affordable Care Act due to the potential for continued changes to the law s implementation and its interpretation by government agencies and courts. There is also uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments passed legislation, promulgated regulations, and have taken other administrative actions intended to assist healthcare providers in providing care to COVID-19 and other patients during the public health emergency and to provide financial relief. Among these, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act had the most impact on our business. The CARES Act included a waiver of insurance copayments, coinsurance, and annual deductibles for laboratory tests to diagnose COVID-19 and visits to diagnose COVID-19 at an emergency department of a hospital. These provisions of the CARES Act expired on June 30, 2021. While these provisions were effective, we experienced higher levels of revenue due to a shift of payor mix. The larger number and acuity of patient claims for COVID-19 also resulted in higher revenue. No Surprises Act The No Surprises Act NSA is a federal law that took effect January 1, 2022, to protect consumers from most instances of surprise balance billing. With respect to the Company, the NSA limits the amount an insured patient will pay for emergency services furnished by an out-of-network provider. The NSA addresses the payment of these out-of-network providers by group health plans or health insurance issuers (collectively, insurers ). In particular, the NSA requires insurers to reimburse out-of-network providers at a statutorily calculated out-of-network rate. In states without an all-payor model agreement or specified state law, the out-of-network rate is either the amount agreed to by the insurer and the out-of-network provider or an amount determined through an independent dispute resolution IDR process. Under the NSA, insurers must issue an initial payment or notice of denial of payment to a provider within thirty days after the provider submits a bill for an out-of-network service. If the provider disagrees with the insurer s determination, the provider may initiate a thirty-day period of open negotiation with the insurer over the claim. If the parties cannot resolve the dispute through negotiation, the parties may then proceed to IDR arbitration. Independent Dispute Resolution. The provider and insurer each submit a proposed payment amount and explanation to the arbitrator. The arbitrator must select one of the two proposed payment amounts taking into account the qualifying payment amount and additional circumstances including among other things the level of training, outcomes measurements of the facility, the acuity of the individual treated, and the case mix and scope of services of the facility providing the service. The NSA prohibits the arbitrator from considering the provider s usual and customary charges for an item or service, or the amount the provider would have billed for the item or service in the absence of the NSA. Qualifying Payment Amount . The qualifying payment amount or QPA is generally the median of the contracted rates recognized by the plan or issuer under such plans or coverage, respectively, on January 31, 2019, for the same or a similar item or service that is provided by a provider in the same or similar specialty and provided in the geographic region in which the items or service is furnished, with annual increases based on the consumer price index. In other words, the qualifying payment amount is typically the median rate the insurer would have paid for the service if provided by an in-network provider or facility. HHS Final Rule. As required by the NSA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services HHS has established an IDR process under which a certified IDR entity determines the ultimate amount of payment. The HHS

Table of Contents 
 final rule became effective October 25, 2022. The final rule eliminated the rebuttable presumption that the qualified payment amount is the correct price and also abandoned the requirement that the certified IDR entity must select the offer closest to the qualifying payment amount. These key provisions were initially part of the interim rule issued in 2021 and were challenged by several court cases. Under the final rule, the certified IDR entity must instead select the offer that best reflects the value of the item or service provided, by first considering the QPA and then considering additional information that is relevant to the dispute. Legal challenges to HHS Final Rule. The final rule was the subject of legal challenges. The Texas Medical Association (TMA) in September of 2022 filed motions for summary judgment in the U.S. Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, seeking to invalidate the IDR related provisions of the final rule, arguing that the QPA does not represent the fair value of the services rendered by the physicians and providers and that the final rule illegally favors the QPA over the fair value of the provider services in contravention of the statutory language of the NSA. On February 6, 2023, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the TMA by granting its motion for summary judgment against the HHS and stating that the revised IDR process in the final rule "continues to place a thumb on the scale" in favor of insurers and conflicts with the statutory provisions of the NSA, is unlawful and must be set aside. The Courts decision vacated all of the revised regulations challenged by the TMA, including HHS rule that arbiters must primarily consider the QPA in the IDR process. The TMA on January 1, 2023 filed a lawsuit TMA IV challenging two items related to the NSA and its implementation: (1) increases in the administrative fees payable in the IDR process from 50 to 350, a 600 increase, and (2) one requirement included in the batching rules for IDR. On August 3, 2023, the U.S. District Court agreed with the TMA and vacated the offending portions of the batching rule that only permitted batching for items with the same service code, allowing for the batching of similar items as allowed by the NSA. Additionally, the fee increase guidance that increased the administrative fees from 50 to 350 was vacated, with the administrative fee of 50 in effect moving forward. The TMA on November 30, 2022 filed a lawsuit TMA III challenging how insurers are establishing the QPA under the final rules, alleging that the final rules allow insurers to include what is referred to in the healthcare industry as ghost rates, which are rates included in contracts with providers who do not actually provide the specified service and as a result are lower than rates a provider would have incentive to meaningfully negotiate, thus artificially lowering the QPA. On August 24, 2023, the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas in TMA III ruled to vacate several aspects of the regulations mandating the methodology for the QPA calculation. In particular, the court prohibited the inclusion of ghost rates as part of the QPA calculation and QPA calculations that are not based on the same or similar specialty. This is the fourth time the federal court has ruled in favor of the TMA effective nationwide. On October 20, 2023, the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal against the court s ruling. This appeal was submitted to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 2, 2024, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated provisions of the No Surprises Act (NSA) that favored insurers. The court affirmed a lower court's ruling. The court held that these rules imposed an unfair advantage on insurers, as arbitrators were instructed to consider the QPA before any other factors, such as the complexity of the medical service or the provider's expertise. The ruling removes these procedural "guardrails," meaning arbitrators now have more discretion and are no longer bound to prioritize the QPA in their decisions. This could result in more arbitrators selecting providers' offers, which tend to be higher than those favored by insurers. The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury may appeal this decision, potentially bringing the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Nutex and NSA. While we are working within the established processes for IDR, we have had varying successes at achieving collections at or higher than the established QPA. We have undertaken several strategic actions designed to improve our collections results. These include: o maximizing our claims coding efficiency, o increasing efforts to collect co-pays and co-insurance, o adding additional administrative staff to handle the increased administrative IDR burden, o having a dedicated IDR team to accelerate resubmission of claims under the IDR process, 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 o making appeals for additional payment of claims for periods before and after the NSA final rule was adopted through the IDR process, o making efforts to sign favorable contracts with new insurers, o working to sign more favorable contracted rates with existing contracted providers, o working with both local and national legislatures to enforce the NSA rules and guidelines for Insurers, and o focusing on the value-base IPA side of our business, which is less affected by the NSA. After the NSA became effective January 1, 2022, our average payment by insurers of adjudicated patient claims by date of service for emergency services had declined by approximately 26 at the end of 2022. At the end of 2023, that overall decline was reduced to 19 from January 1, 2022, thereby showing an incremental improvement of 7 from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023. In our experience, insurers often initially pay amounts lower than the QPA without regard for other information relevant to the claim. This requires us to make appeals using the IDR process. As of the end of September 2024, we submitted 89,960 cases for IDR open negotiation or arbitration, whereas in the full year of 2023, we submitted 98,000 cases for IDR open negotiation only. In the first half of 2024, there were delays in payor processing due to outages caused by the 2024 Change Healthcare ransomware attack. As the outages have been resolved, we expect IDR filings to increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. We anticipate approximately 60-70 of our claims to be submitted through the IDR process by year end. The IDR process, subsequent appeals and insurance payor delays require extensive administrative time and delays in collections. While we are working within the established processes for IDR, we have had varying successes at achieving collections at or higher than the established QPA. On July 1, 2024, we engaged with a third-party IDR vendor to further support all of our out of network claims and determine which claims would be beneficial to arbitrate. The IDR arbitration process can take up to four to six months to receive payments. Based on the available data we have analyzed from the third and fourth quarters of 2023, providers have submitted higher offers and have prevailed 80 of the time through IDR. As we work with the third-party IDR vendor, we will have more data on the actual collections and reimbursement from IDR by the end of 2024. Other NSA Developments. Effective January 1, 2024, in consultation with the Departments of Labor and HHS, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced the annual increase that health plans must apply to the calculation of the QPA for insurance reimbursements to account for inflation from 2023 to 2024 (Notice 2024-1). Under the No Surprises Act, QPAs are calculated based on median contracted rates for the same or similar service as they existed in 2019. Treasury Regulations direct the IRS to anchor the annual inflationary update in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). In Notice 2024-1, the IRS directs health plans to update QPAs in 2024 by an increase of 5.4 over 2023 QPAs. Alternatively, to update 2023 rates, health plans may return to the original 2019 calculation and apply a cumulative update factor to account for the IRS inflationary updates from 2019 to 2024. Under that approach, the cumulative update that must be applied to 2019 base year rates is 20.9 . We are supportive of industry efforts challenging NSA. Our experience, like that of many other healthcare providers, is that the final rule continues to unfairly favor insurers in the determination of the QPA we receive for our healthcare services. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of efforts to challenge or amend the final rule. As well, there can be no assurance that third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates they pay for our services or that additional rules issued under the NSA will not have adverse consequences to our business. Recent Developments 2024 Reverse Stock Splits 1:15 Reverse stock split. The Company s Board of Directors determined to effect a reverse stock split of the common stock at a 1-for-15 ratio (the 1:15 Reverse Stock Split effective as of 11:59 pm Eastern time on April 9, 2024.

Unless otherwise indicated, all authorized, issued, and outstanding stock and per share amounts contained in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits for all prior periods presented. Proportionate adjustments for the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits were made to the exercise prices and number of shares issuable under the Company s equity incentive plans, and the number of shares underlying outstanding equity awards, as applicable. On July 24, 2024, the Company received written notice (the Compliance Notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires that companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share. Nasdaq notified the Company in the Compliance Notice that, from July 3, 2024 to July 23, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock had been 1.00 per share or greater and, accordingly, the Company had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and that the matter was now closed. Results of Operations We report the results of our operations as three segments in our consolidated financial statements: (i) the hospital division, (ii) the population health management division and (ii) the real estate division. Activity within our business segments is significantly impacted by demand for healthcare services we provide, competition for these services in each of the market areas we serve, and the legislative changes discussed above.

Our 2024 results were principally affected by higher revenue and cost due to: Higher patient visits, which increased by 11.3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period of 2023. Same store mature hospitals increased visits an average of 3.8 versus prior year as well as the opening of four new hospitals in 2023; Increased revenue per visit due to success in efforts to obtain higher rates through the Independent Dispute Resolution IDR process and increased utilization of higher paid services such as increased observation and in-patient stays. Higher stock-based compensation to ramping hospitals of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.0 million compared to the same period last year. Higher income tax expense of 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a tax benefit of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.9 million. Higher interest expense of 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.3 million compared to the same period last year.

 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 13.5 million from 1.3 million for the comparable period of 2023. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures discussed below for a definition and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. The items affecting revenue contributed significantly to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the 2024 period. A discussion of our segment results is included below. Hospital Division. Our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 71.7 million as compared to 54.6 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 17.1 million or 31.3 . This increase was attributed to an increase in visits, an increase in revenue per visit due to success in efforts to obtain higher rates through the IDR process and increased utilization of higher paid services such as increased observation and in-patient stays. Of this revenue increase, 20.7 related to mature hospitals, which are hospitals that were opened by December 31, 2021. The following table shows the number of patient visits during the periods: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Patient visits: Hospital 41,668 37,443 Total patient visits increased 11.3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period of 2023 including the opening of four facilities throughout 2023 which are fully operating in 2024. Of this visit increase, 3.8 related to mature hospitals, which are hospitals opened by December 31, 2021. The hospital division s operating income was 21.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with an operating income of 7.2 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of 197.2 . Our revenue and operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was positively affected by the increase in visits and increase in rate paid by insurers discussed above. Population Health Management Division. Our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.1 million as compared with 8.1 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease in revenue was due to no revenue amounts attributed to Clinigence and Procare businesses as those businesses were sold in 2024. The population health management division had 0.5 million of operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 0.2 million of operating loss for the same period of 2023. Strategically, we are focused on the growth of this division principally through the addition of new independent physician associations and have staffed our organization to manage larger numbers of such organizations. Real Estate Division. This division reports the operations of consolidated Real Estate Entities where we provide guarantees of their indebtedness or are co-borrowers. Revenue and operating expenses of consolidated Real Estate Entities are not significant since the extent of these entities operations is to own facilities leased to our hospital division entities which are financed by a combination of contributed equity by related parties and third-party mortgage indebtedness. Such leases are typically on a triple net basis where our hospital division is responsible for all operating costs, repairs and taxes on the facilities. Finance lease income is recognized outside of segment operating income as other income by the Real Estate Entities. However, these amounts are largely eliminated in the consolidation of these entities into our financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, two Real Estate Entities continue to be consolidated in our financial statements. We expect that hospitals we open in the future may be leased from new Real Estate Entities which may be owned in whole or part by related parties. Third-party lenders to these entities may require that we provide a guarantee or become co-borrowers under mortgage indebtedness and financings for such facilities. In such instances, we may be required to consolidate these new Real Estate Entities in our financial statements as VIEs.

 Corporate and other costs. Corporate and other costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 12.3 million as compared to 7.9 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 55.7 . General and administrative costs include our executive management, accounting, human resources, corporate technology, insurance and professional fees. The increase in corporate and other costs is primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of 2.0 million, and an increase in general and administrative expenses of 2.1 million, of which 0.8 million is due to an increase accrued wages and bonuses. Nonoperating items Interest expense. Interest expense was 5.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 4.1 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in interest expense for the 2024 period is principally due to discount amortization expense, the opening of new facilities in 2023 and interest expense associated with the Unsecured Convertible Term Debt. Loss on warrant liability. Loss on warrant liability was 6.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is the remeasurement of the warrant liability required at each reporting period and for every warrant exercise. The loss is influenced by changes in our common stock market price. Income tax expense. Income tax provisions for interim quarterly periods are generally based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate calculated separately from the effect of significant, infrequent or unusual items related specifically to interim periods. The income tax impact of discrete items is recognized in the period these occur. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately (177.7) . The primary difference from the federal statutory rate of 21 is related to state taxes, income of noncontrolling interests in flow-through entities and permanent differences for non-deductible expenses. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net loss attributable to Nutex Health Inc. decreased to 9.5 million, or a loss of 1.91 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a net loss attributable to Nutex Health Inc. of 14.2 million, or a loss of 3.23 per share, for the same period of 2023. Our 2024 results were principally affected by higher revenue and cost due to: Higher patient visits, which increased by 19.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period of 2023; same store mature hospitals increased visits an average of 7.7 versus prior year as well as the opening of four new hospitals in 2023. Increased revenue per visit due to payor payment rates through the IDR process and increased utilization of higher paid services such as increased observation and in-patient stays. Impairment of assets of 3.9 million and impairment of goodwill of 3.2 million (both non-cash) due to the divesture of two smaller population health entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 further discussed in Note 3 . Higher income tax expense of 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a tax benefit of 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 7.8 million or 381 . Loss on warrant liability of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 30.1 million from 7.7 million for the comparable period of 2023. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures discussed below for a definition and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. The items affecting revenue contributed significantly to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the 2024 period. A discussion of our segment results is included below. Hospital Division. Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 199.4 million as compared to 155.5 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 43.9 million or 28.2 . This increase was attributed to an increase in visits, and an increase in revenue per visit due to success in efforts to obtain higher rates through the IDR

 process and increased utilization of higher paid services such as increased observation and in-patient stays. Of this revenue increase, 13.5 related to mature hospitals, which are hospitals that were opened by December 31, 2021. The following table shows the number of patient visits during the periods: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Patient visits: Hospital 122,944 102,798 Total patient visits increased 19.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period of 2023 due mostly to the opening of four facilities throughout 2023 which are fully operating in 2024. Of this visit increase, 7.7 related to mature hospitals, which are hospitals opened by December 31, 2021. The hospital division s operating income was 54.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with an operating income of 21.1 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of 159.2 . Our revenue and operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was positively affected by the increase in visits and revenue per visit discussed above. Population Health Management Division. Our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.0 million as compared with 22.5 million for the same period of 2023. The increase was due to higher capitation revenue earned. The population health management division had 0.1 million of operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 0.4 million of operating income for the same period of 2023. Strategically, we are focused on the growth of this division principally through the addition of new independent physician associations and have staffed our organization to manage larger numbers of such organizations. Real Estate Division. This division reports the operations of consolidated Real Estate Entities where we provide guarantees of their indebtedness or are co-borrowers. Revenue and operating expenses of consolidated Real Estate Entities are not significant since the extent of these entities operations is to own facilities leased to our hospital division entities which are financed by a combination of contributed equity by related parties and third-party mortgage indebtedness.

Finance lease income is recognized outside of segment operating income as other income by the Real Estate Entities. However, these amounts are largely eliminated in the consolidation of these entities into our financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, two Real Estate Entities continue to be consolidated in our financial statements. We expect that hospitals we open in the future may be leased from new Real Estate Entities which may be owned in whole or part by related parties. Third-party lenders to these entities may require that we provide a guarantee or become co-borrowers under mortgage indebtedness and financings for such facilities. In such instances, we may be required to consolidate these new Real Estate Entities in our financial statements as VIEs. Corporate and other costs. Corporate and other costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 38.2 million as compared to 27.2 million for the same period of 2023, an increase of 40.4 . General and administrative costs include our executive management, accounting, human resources, corporate technology, insurance and professional fees. The increase in corporate and other costs is primarily due to impairment of assets of 3.9 million, impairment of goodwill of 3.2 million, and accrued wages and bonuses of 1.3 million. These impairments are related to the sale of Procare and Clinigence Health.

 Nonoperating items Interest expense. Interest expense was 14.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 12.1 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in interest expense for the 2024 period is principally due to discount amortization expense, the opening of new facilities and interest expense associated with the Unsecured Convertible Term Debt. Loss on warrant liability. Loss on warrant liability was 1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the remeasurement of the warrant liability required at every warrant exercise and each reporting period. The remeasurement is influenced by changes in our common stock market price. Income tax expense. Income tax provisions for interim quarterly periods are generally based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate calculated separately from the effect of significant, infrequent or unusual items related specifically to interim periods. The income tax impact of discrete items is recognized in the period these occur. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 501.2 . The primary difference from the federal statutory rate of 21 is related to state taxes, income of noncontrolling interests in flow-through entities and permanent differences for non-deductible expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 46.9 million of cash and equivalents, compared to 22.0 million of cash and equivalents at December 31, 2023. Significant sources and uses of cash during the first nine months of 2024. Sources of cash: Cash from operating activities was 23.1 million, which included 4.8 million from the primary components of our working capital (receivables, inventories, accounts payable and expenses) Proceeds from common stock issuance of 9.2 million, net issuance costs Proceeds from note payable 7.0 million; and Proceeds from exercise of warrants 0.8 million. Uses of cash: Repayments of lines of credit and notes payable 9.4 million Capital expenditures were 1.9 million Cash related to sale of business 0.4 million Distributions, net of contributions, to noncontrolling interests totaled 2.7 million Repayments of finance leases totaled 1.9 million; and Future sources and uses of cash. Our operating activities are financed with cash on hand, which is generated from revenues, which may vary significantly based on regulatory changes affecting the timing and amounts of insurance reimbursements for our services. Most of our hospital facilities are leased from various lessors including related parties. These leases are presented in our consolidated balance sheets unless the lease is from a consolidated Real Estate Entity. Our growth plans include the development of new hospital locations. We expect that in many of these locations we will lease facilities from newly established entities partially owned by related parties. We routinely enter into equipment lease agreements to procure new or replacement equipment and may also finance these purchases with term debt . We have smaller lines of credits available for working capital purposes and are presently working to supplement or replace these with larger financing commitments. These larger financing commitments are subject to market conditions, and we may not be able to obtain such larger financing commitments with favorable economic terms or at all. We also believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and available borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs requirements for operations and

 growth objectives for at least the next twelve months. If the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. Indebtedness. As discussed above, we enter into debt arrangements, classified as long-term debt on our financial statements, to address equipment purchases and working capital purposes. We also enter into lease agreements for our hospital facilities, classified as lease liabilities on our financial statements. The Company s indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 is presented in Item I, Financial Statements Note 8 Debt and our lease obligations are presented in Item I, Financial Statements Note 9 Leases. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Nutex Health Inc. plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for an allocation to noncontrolling interests, (gain)/loss on warrant liability, stock-based compensation, any facilities closing costs, acquisition related costs and impairments. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

 December 31, 2023 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Company s critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates are described in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes in the Company s accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk With respect to the three months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our primary market risk exposures or how those exposures are managed since the information disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision of our CEO and our CFO, the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the Company concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weakness previously identified as described below. Previously Reported Material Weaknesses. We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria ). Based on our assessment, the following material weaknesses were identified: The Company had ineffective design, implementation, and operation controls over logical access, program change management, and vendor management controls: 1) appropriate restrictions that would adequately prevent users from gaining inappropriate access to the financially relevant systems. 2) IT program and data changes affecting the Company s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT systems were complete and accurate. Automated process-level and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency. 3) key third party service provider SOC reports were obtained and reviewed. Business process controls across all financial reporting processes were not effectively designed and implemented to properly address the risk of material misstatement, including controls without proper segregation of duties between preparer and reviewer and key management review controls. Ineffective design and implementation of controls over the completeness and accuracy of information included in key spreadsheets supporting the financial statements. 
 Management has concluded that, based on applying the COSO criteria, as of December 31, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 Remediation Plans. These material weaknesses did not result in a material misstatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. In 2023, the Company started the process of designing and implementing effective internal control measures to remediate the reported material weaknesses. The Company s efforts included implementing a new enterprise-wide system to reduce reliance on manual processes and spreadsheets supporting the financial statements. Additionally, the Company engaged an accounting firm in 2023 to assist in the proper design, implementation and testing of internal controls over financial reporting. We added key senior management positions including a Chief Operating Officer and made additions to our accounting and financial reporting teams throughout 2023. Throughout 2024, we added a director of information technology and we have strengthened our internal audit program to review and monitor the Company s progress with our remediation plans. While we believe that these efforts will improve our internal control over financial reporting, our remediation efforts are ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as audit committee oversight. We will not be able to conclude whether the steps we are taking will fully remediate the remaining material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting until we have completed our remediation efforts and subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness. We may also conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. We are taking actions to remediate the material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting, as described above. Except as otherwise described herein, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our senior members of management do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, the Company, its consolidated subsidiaries or VIEs may be named in various claims and legal actions in the normal course of business. The Company is not involved in any legal proceedings that it believes would have a material effect on its business or financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Risk Factors included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings, which could materially affect our businesses, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.
