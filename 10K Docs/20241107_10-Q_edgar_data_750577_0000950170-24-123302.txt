The Company held securities classified as trading at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were gross gains or gross losses on sales of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net gains or losses, when applicable, are reflected in the "Securities transactions, net" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Securities with carrying values totaling approximately billion and billion were pledged as collateral at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily to secure public deposits or securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Credit Quality The Company s policy is to invest only in securities of investment grade quality. These investments are largely limited to U.S. agency securities and municipal securities. Management has concluded, based on the long history of no credit losses, that the expectation of nonpayment of the held to maturity securities carried at amortized cost is zero for securities that are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. As such, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. The municipal portfolio is analyzed separately for allowance for credit loss in accordance with the applicable guidance for each portfolio as noted below. The Company evaluates credit impairment for individual securities available for sale whose fair value was below amortized cost with a more than inconsequential risk of default and where the Company had assessed whether the decline in fair value was significant enough to suggest a credit event occurred. There were securities with a material credit loss event and, therefore, allowance for credit loss was recorded in any period presented.

At each reporting period, the Company evaluated its held to maturity municipal obligation portfolio for credit loss using probability of default and loss given default models. The models were run using a long-term average probability of default migration and with a probability weighting of Moody s economic forecasts. The resulting credit losses, if any, were negligible and no allowance for credit loss was recorded.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and securities, respectively, with market values below their cost basis. There were no material unrealized losses related to the marketability of the securities or the issuer s ability to meet contractual obligations. In all cases, the indicated impairment on these debt securities would be recovered no later than the security s maturity date or possibly earlier if the market price for the security increases with a reduction in the yield required by the market. The unrealized losses were deemed to be non-credit related at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had adequate liquidity and, therefore, neither planned to nor expected to be required to liquidate these securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis.

Total loans 

The following briefly describes the composition of each loan category and portfolio class. Commercial and industrial Commercial and industrial loans are made available to businesses for working capital (including financing of inventory and receivables), business expansion, facilitating the acquisition of a business, and the purchase of equipment and machinery, including equipment leasing. These loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, when secured, have the added strength of the underlying collateral. Commercial non-real estate loans may be secured by the assets being financed or other tangible or intangible business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, ownership, enterprise value or commodity interests, and may incorporate a personal or corporate guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, including a small portfolio of corporate credit cards, generally issued as a part of overall customer relationships. Commercial real estate owner occupied loans consist of commercial mortgages on properties where repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities of the borrower. Like commercial non-real estate, these loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower, but also have the added strength of the value of underlying real estate collateral. Commercial real estate income producing Commercial real estate income producing loans consist of loans secured by commercial mortgages on properties where the loan is made to real estate developers or investors and repayment is dependent on the sale, refinance, or income generated from the operation of the property. Properties financed include retail, office, multifamily, senior housing, hotel/motel, skilled nursing facilities and other commercial properties.

Below are the definitions of the Company s internally assigned grades: Commercial: Pass loans properly approved, documented, collateralized, and performing which do not reflect an abnormal credit risk. 

 Pass-Watch credits in this category are of sufficient risk to cause concern. This category is reserved for credits that display negative performance trends. The Watch grade should be regarded as a transition category. 

 Special Mention a criticized asset category defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the institution s credit position. Special mention credits are not considered part of the classified credit categories and do not expose the institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 

 Substandard an asset that is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

 Doubtful an asset that has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

 Loss credits classified as loss are considered uncollectable and are charged off promptly once so classified. 

 Residential and Consumer: Performing accruing loans. 

 Nonperforming loans for which there are good reasons to doubt that payments will be made in full. Nonperforming loans include all loans with nonaccrual status.

Additionally, the Company recognizes deferred taxes on the basis difference of the tax equity investment to reflect the financial impact of other tax benefits (e.g., tax operating losses) not included in the practical expedient amortization. The tax credits, when realized, are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a reduction of income tax expense. The Company s investments in affordable housing limited partnerships totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a carry balance net of accumulated amortization included in the other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaling million and million, respectively, for those same periods.

At September 30, 2024, the FHLB advances outstanding was comprised of fixed-rate facilities with a weighted average interest rate of that both matured on . The FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2023 included fixed rate advance with an interest rate of that matured on . As these short-term advances mature, they are generally paid off and replaced with new short-term FHLB advances, if warranted, depending on funding needs. Also included in short-term borrowings are securities sold under agreements to repurchase that mature daily and are secured by U.S. agency securities totaling million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company borrows funds on a secured basis by selling securities under agreements to repurchase, mainly in connection with treasury management services offered to its deposit customers. As the Company maintains effective control over assets sold under agreements to repurchase, the securities continue to be carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Because the Company acts as borrower transferring assets to the counterparty, and the agreements mature daily, the Company s risk is limited. The remaining balances in short-term borrowings for both periods are federal funds purchased, which are unsecured borrowings from other banks, generally on an overnight basis.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company is party to various interest rate swap agreements designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of the Company s forecasted variable cash flows for pools of variable rate loans. For each agreement, the Company receives interest at a fixed rate and pays at a variable rate . T he Company terminated four and six swap agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and paid cash of approximately million and million, respectively, for those same periods. The net cash paid for these transactions was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and is being amortized into earnings through the original maturity dates of the respective contracts. The notional amounts of the swap agreements in place at September 30, 2024 expire as follows: million in ; million in ; million in ; and million in . Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk Interest rate swaps on securities available for sale The Company is party to forward-starting fixed payer swaps that convert the latter portion of the term of certain available for sale securities to a floating rate. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk. This strategy provides the Company with a fixed rate coupon during the front-end unhedged tenor of the bonds and results in a floating rate security during the back-end hedged tenor. At September 30, 2024, these single layer instruments have hedge start dates between January 2025 and July 2026, and maturity dates from December 2027 through March 2031. The fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk is presented in interest income along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.

 million, excluding any basis adjustment. The amount that represents the hedged items was million and the basis adjustment associated with the hedged items was a loss totaling million. T he Company terminated three fair value swap agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and received cash of approximately million. At the time of termination, the value of the swap was recorded as an adjustment to the book value of the underlying security, thereby changing its current book yield and extending its duration, if held, or impacting the net gain or loss, if sold. There were no fair value swap agreements terminated during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges Customer interest rate derivative program The Bank enters into interest rate derivative agreements, primarily rate swaps, with commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. The Bank enters into offsetting agreements with unrelated financial institutions, thereby mitigating its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Because the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. Risk participation agreements The Bank also enters into risk participation agreements under which it may either assume or sell credit risk associated with a borrower s performance under certain interest rate derivative contracts. In those instances where the Bank has assumed credit risk, it is not a direct counterparty to the derivative contract with the borrower and has entered into the risk participation agreement because it is a party to the related loan agreement with the borrower. In those instances in which the Bank has sold credit risk, it is the sole counterparty to the derivative contract with the borrower and has entered into the risk participation agreement because other banks participate in the related loan agreement. The Bank manages its credit risk under risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrower, based on the Bank s normal credit review process. Mortgage banking derivatives The Bank also enters into certain derivative agreements as part of its mortgage banking activities. These agreements include interest rate lock commitments on prospective residential mortgage loans and forward commitments to sell loans to investors on either a best efforts or a mandatory delivery basis. The Company uses these forward sales commitments, which may include To Be Announced TBA security contracts, on the open market to protect the value of its rate locks and mortgage loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing between the origination of the rate lock and the final sale of these loans. These instruments meet the definition of derivative financial instruments and are reflected in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes to the fair value recorded in noninterest income within the secondary mortgage market operations line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The loans sold on a mandatory basis commit the Company to deliver a specific principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price, by a specified date. If the Company fails to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, we may be obligated to pay a pair-off fee, based on then-current market prices, to the investor/counterparty to compensate the investor for the shortfall. Mandatory delivery forward commitments include TBA security contracts on the open market to provide protection against changes in interest rates on the locked mortgage pipeline. The Company expects that mandatory delivery contracts, including TBA security contracts, will experience changes in fair value opposite to the changes in the fair value of derivative loan commitments. Certain assumptions, including pull through rates and rate lock periods, are used in managing the existing and future hedges. The accuracy of underlying assumptions could impact the ultimate effectiveness of any hedging strategies. Forward commitments under best effort contracts commit the Company to deliver a specific individual mortgage loan to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. Generally, best efforts cash contracts have no pair-off risk regardless of market movement. The price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded, generally the same day the Company enters into the interest rate lock commitment with the potential borrower. The Company expects that these best efforts forward loan sale commitments will experience a net neutral shift in fair value with related derivative loan commitments.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of the Bank s derivative instruments contain provisions allowing the financial institution counterparty to terminate the contracts in certain circumstances, such as a downgrade of the Bank s credit ratings below specified levels, a default by the Bank on its indebtedness, or the failure of the Bank to maintain specified minimum regulatory capital ratios or its regulatory status as a well-capitalized institution. These derivative agreements also contain provisions regarding the posting of collateral by each party. At

The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under this program, and the board of directors has the ability to terminate or amend the program at any time prior to the expiration date.

Nonvested at September 30, 2024 

At September 30, 2024 , there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted and performance share awards and units expected to vest in the future. This compensation is expected to be recognized in expense over a weighted average period of years. The total fair value of shares that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company granted restricted stock units (RSUs) to certain eligible employees. Unlike restricted share awards (RSAs), the holders of unvested restricted stock units have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including voting or dividend rights. The Company has elected to award dividend equivalents on each restricted stock unit not deferred under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Such dividend equivalents are forfeited should the employee terminate employment prior to the vesting of the RSU. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company granted performance share awards subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance metric with a grant date fair value of per share and performance share awards subject to an adjusted earnings per share performance metric with a grant date fair value of per share to key members of executive management. The number of performance shares subject to TSR that ultimately vest at the end of the performance period, if any, will be based on the relative rank of the Company s three-year TSR among the TSRs of a peer group of regional banks. The fair value of the performance shares subject to TSR at the grant date was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation method. The number of performance shares subject to adjusted earnings per share that ultimately vest will be based on the Company s attainment of certain adjusted earnings per share goals over the performance period.

Legal Proceedings The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that loss contingencies, if any, arising from pending litigation and regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Special Assessment In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special deposit insurance assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) arising from the full protection of uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception following the receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the spring of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a pre-tax special assessment expense totaling million based on the November 2023 final rule. In 2024, the FDIC provided notice that the estimated losses attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank had increased and the Company increased the loss accrual to million. The loss estimates resulting from the failures of these institutions may be subject to further change pending the projected and actual outcome of loss share agreements, joint ventures, and outstanding litigation. The exact amount of losses incurred will not be determined until the FDIC terminates the receiverships of these banks; therefore, the Company's exact exposure for FDIC special assessment remains unknown.

 Securities classified as level 2 include obligations of U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, including U.S. Treasury securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations that are issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, and state and municipal bonds. The level 2 fair value measurements for investment securities are obtained quarterly from a third-party pricing service that uses industry-standard pricing models. Substantially all of the model inputs are observable in the marketplace or can be supported by observable data. The Company invests only in securities of investment grade quality with a targeted duration, for the overall portfolio, generally between two and five and a half years . Company policies generally limit investments to U.S. agency securities and municipal

 shares of Visa Class B common stock. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Class A common stock, such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and the Company will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The agreement also requires periodic payments by the Company to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares at the time of sale and a fixed rate of interest that steps up once after the eighth scheduled quarterly payment. The fair value of the liability is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are the Company s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. Refer to Note 6 Derivatives for information about the derivative contract with the counterparty. The Company believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

The Company s policy is to recognize transfers between valuation hierarchy levels as of the end of a reporting period. Fair Value of Assets Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Collateral-dependent loans individually evaluated for credit loss loans are level 2 assets measured at the fair value of the underlying collateral based on independent third-party appraisals that take into consideration market-based information such as recent sales activity for similar assets in the property s market. Other real estate owned and foreclosed assets, including both foreclosed property and surplus banking property, are level 3 assets that are adjusted to fair value, less estimated selling costs, upon transfer from loans or property and equipment. Subsequently, other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair values are determined by sales agreement or third-party appraisals as discounted for estimated selling costs, information from comparable sales, and marketability of the assets. The fair value information presented below is not as of the period end, rather it was as of the date the fair value adjustment was recorded during the twelve months for each of the dates presented below, and excludes nonrecurring fair value measurements of assets no longer on the balance sheet.

 OVERVIEW 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include non-GAAP measures used to describe our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered on a standalone basis or as a substitute for analyses of financial condition and results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized and therefore, it may not be possible to compare these measures with other companies that present measures having the same or similar names. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. 
 A reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures are provided in the Consolidated Financial Results table later in this item. The following is a summary of these non-GAAP measures and an explanation as to why they are deemed useful. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Consistent with the provisions of subpart 229.1400 of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation S-K, Disclosures by Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants, we present net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratios on a fully taxable equivalent ("te") basis. The te basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments using a statutory federal tax rate of 21 to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
 We present certain additional non-GAAP financial measures to assist the reader with a better understanding of the Company s performance period over period, and to provide investors with assistance in understanding the success management has experienced in executing its strategic initiatives. The Company highlights certain items that are outside of our principal business and/or are not indicative of forward-looking trends in supplemental disclosure items below our GAAP financial data and presents certain "Adjusted" ratios that exclude these disclosed items. These adjusted ratios provide management and the reader with a measure that may be more indicative of forward-looking trends in our business, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains or losses and changes. 
 We define Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue as net income excluding provision expense and income tax expense, plus the taxable equivalent adjustment (as defined above), less supplemental disclosure items (as defined above). Management believes that adjusted pre-provision net revenue is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. We define Adjusted Revenue as net interest income (te) and noninterest income less supplemental disclosure items. We define Adjusted Noninterest Expense as noninterest expense less supplemental disclosure items. We define our Efficiency Ratio as noninterest expense to total net interest income (te) and noninterest income, excluding amortization of purchased intangibles and supplemental disclosure items, if applicable. Management believes adjusted revenue, adjusted noninterest expense and the efficiency ratio are useful measures as they provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability with prior periods. 
 Current Economic Environment 
 The Federal Reserve signaled in its July 2024 meeting that it will be attentive to both sides of a dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices and cut the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in September, indicating a shift in focus to maintenance of a strong labor market. Inflation remains a key driver of economic conditions and monetary policy, with headline and core (excluding food and energy) inflation at an annual rate of 2.4 and 3.3 , respectively, in September 2024, still above the Federal Reserve's target inflation rate of 2.0 . The labor market has shown signs of weakening in recent months, with the unemployment rate rising to a nearly three-year high of 4.3 in July 2024. Despite the migration in employment statistics, the relative health of the labor market remains solid, with wage growth and a reduction in the unemployment rate to 4.1 in September, serving as positive economic indicators. Consumer spending remains robust, leading to healthy Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 2.8 on an annualized basis in the third quarter of 2024. U.S. economic activity has remained resilient through substantial burden in recent years, where a continuation of strong consumer spending, the overall health of the labor market and the most recent and anticipated future interest rate cuts may help prevent or reduce the severity of a potential recession in the near-term. However, ongoing price pressures, some volatility in labor markets and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's future actions with respect to monetary policy may adversely affect capital markets and could result in below-trend economic growth. Economic trends may be further influenced by factors outside of inflation, such as continued pressure on the commercial real estate sector, uncertainty surrounding the impact of change in presidential administration, and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. 
 Within the financial services sector, institutions continue to contend with industry-specific headwinds. The elevated interest rate environment and heightened competition for deposits has fostered a shift within deposit composition toward higher cost products, although the pace of movement has continued to slow, allowing deposit costs to stabilize. The interest rate environment has also steadily affected the affordability of credit to consumers and businesses, moderating loan demand. At the same time, economic uncertainty and industry turmoil have prompted financial institutions to tighten credit standards. Many financial institutions, including ours, have also experienced some degree of deterioration in credit quality metrics from the mostly-benign credit environment experienced during the majority of the last three years. 
 Within our markets, loan growth remains tempered in response to heightened interest rates and increased insurance costs. Further, we have continued to reduce exposure to syndicated credits as we focus on full-service relationships. However, interest rates on new, renewed and repricing variable rate loans continue to result in higher yields on earning assets that, coupled with stabilization in funding costs, has contributed to net interest margin expansion during the quarter.

 Economic Outlook 
 We utilize economic forecasts produced by Moody s that provide various scenarios to assist in the development of our economic outlook. This outlook discussion utilizes the September 2024 Moody s forecasts, the most current available at the time of our computation of the September 30, 2024 allowance for credit losses. The forecasts are anchored on a baseline forecast scenario, which Moody s defines as the most likely outcome of where the economy is headed based on current conditions. Several upside and downside scenarios are produced that are derived from the baseline scenario that display varying depictions of economic performance as compared to the baseline. 
 Management applied a weighting of 40 to the baseline and 60 to the mild recessionary S-2 scenario in the computation of the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, consistent with the scenarios and respective weighting used at June 30, 2024. Our overall credit loss outlook has not changed significantly, and we continue to believe slower near-term growth or a mild recession is reasonably possible due to uncertainty in current economic conditions. 
 The baseline scenario continues to incorporate the belief that the Federal Reserve will bring inflation at or near its target rate of 2.0 without precipitating a recession. Key assumptions within the September 2024 baseline forecast include the following: (1) the Federal Reserve will make 25-basis point cuts to its benchmark interest rate in both September and December 2024, with subsequent cuts occurring until the benchmark rate reaches 3.0 in 2027; (2) the economy is at near full-employment, and the unemployment rate will remain near its current level of 4 in the coming years; (3) GDP will display modest annual growth of 2.6 in 2024, 2.1 in 2025, and 2.0 in 2026; and (4) the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will average 4.2 in 2024, and will remain near this level through the end of the decade. 
 The S-2 scenario presents a downside alternative to the baseline. Compared to baseline, the S-2 scenario assumes that elevated interest rates weaken credit-sensitive spending more than anticipated, fiscal disputes in Congress lead to declines in business and consumer sentiment, geopolitical conflicts will create longer and farther-reaching disturbances, and continued disruption in the financial services industry will lead to additional tightening of credit standards. Further, the scenario assumes the unemployment rate will increase considerably to 6.7 in 2025 before improving to 4.9 in 2026 and 4.0 in 2027. As the economy weakens, the Federal Reserve commences rate cuts in the third quarter of 2024, deeper than those assumed in the baseline. As a result of these pressures, the U.S. falls into a mild recession beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 that lasts for three quarters, with the stock market contracting 21 and a peak-to-trough decline in GDP of 1 . 
 
 The credit loss outlook for our portfolio as a whole has not changed materially since June 30, 2024. We continue to closely monitor our portfolio for customers that are sensitive to prolonged inflation, the elevated interest rate environment and/or other economic circumstances that may impact credit quality. We expect end-of-period loan balances at December 31, 2024 to be flat or slightly down from the previous year end. 
 There are a number of uncertainties in the current economic outlook, including the Federal Reserve's actions with respect to monetary policy. The full extent of the impact of these factors, among others, is uncertain and may have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, including the possibility of slower growth or an economic recession in the near or mid-term. 
 Highlights of the Third Quarter 2024 
 We reported net income for the third quarter of 2024 of 115.6 million, or 1.33 per diluted common share, compared to 114.6 million, or 1.31 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2024 and 97.7 million, or 1.12 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Third quarter 2024 results compared to second quarter 2024: 
 Net income of 115.6 million, or 1.33 per diluted share, up 1.0 million, or 0.02 per diluted share 

Pre-provision net revenue, a non-GAAP measure, totaled 166.5 million, up 10.1 million, or 6 

Period-end loans totaled 23.5 billion, down 456.0 million, or 2 ; reflects continued reduction of shared national credit portfolio 

Criticized commercial loans and nonaccrual loans continued to normalize from the recent benign credit environment; annualized net charge-offs increased to 0.30 compared to 0.12 

Allowance for credit losses coverage of 1.46 , up 3 basis points (bps) 

Period-end deposits totaled 29.0 billion, down 217.8 million, or 1 

Net interest margin of 3.39 , up 2 bps from 3.37 

Common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.78 , up 53 bps, and tangible common equity ratio of 9.56 , up 79 bps 

Efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, improved to 54.42 , compared to 56.18

Table of Contents 

Our results for the third quarter of 2024 represent solid performance that again reflected improved profitability and efficiency. Net interest income increased, reflecting higher loan and securities yields and a flat cost of funds, fee income continued to increase and operating expenses were down. Strong earnings facilitated continued growth in our capital ratios that generally compare favorably to our peers. Credit metrics continued to normalize compared to the earlier post-pandemic benign environment. As a result, we remain focused on identifying specific and broader risk indicators that may be impacting certain segments in our portfolio. However, we have not seen signs of significant weakening, in any particular industry, sector or geographic segment, beyond what we believe has been experienced by the banking industry as a whole, and we continue to maintain a robust allowance for credit loss coverage of 1.46 in light of the current credit and economic environment. We remain focused on balance sheet optimization and effective expense control, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to enhance shareholder value.

(a) For analytical purposes, management adjusts interest income and net interest income for tax-exempt items to a taxable equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 . 

(b) The tangible common equity ratio is common stockholders equity less intangible assets divided by total assets less intangible assets. 

(c) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense to total net interest (te) and noninterest income, excluding amortization of purchased intangibles and supplemental disclosure items. 

(d) Refer to the non-GAAP financial measures section of this analysis for a discussion of these measures. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income (te) for the third quarter of 2024 was 274.5 million, up 1.2 million, or less than 1 , compared to the second quarter of 2024, and was 816.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, down 19.7 million, or 2 , from the comparable period in 2023. 
 The 1.2 million increase in net interest income (te) compared to the second quarter of 2024 is largely attributable to an additional accrual day, higher loan and securities yields, and lower rates on borrowings, partially offset by an increase in deposit costs. Interest income (te) was up 1.8 million, primarily due to the additional accrual day, with increases in loan and securities yields more than offset by the decline in average loan balances. Interest expense was up 0.6 million, largely due to the additional accrual day and a net increase of 1 bp in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by both a decrease in the average balance and rates paid on short-term borrowings. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.39 , up 2 bps from 3.37 in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in the net interest margin from the prior quarter was largely driven by higher loan yields, higher securities yields, and lower borrowing costs, partially offset by an increase in deposit costs.

 The 19.7 million decrease in net interest income (te) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 reflects the growth in and prevailing rates on interest-bearing liabilities outpacing those of earning assets. The decline in net interest income (te) includes a 104.8 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by an 85.1 million increase in interest income (te). The increase in interest expense is largely due to a shift in the mix of deposits from noninterest-bearing and low interest-bearing transaction and savings deposits into higher cost products at competitive interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of borrowings, largely the result of the decrease in average FHLB advances. The increase in interest income (te) was largely driven by higher loan yields. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was down 1 bp from the comparative period in 2023, driven largely by the increase in cost of deposits outpacing the yield on earning assets. The rate on interest-bearing liabilities was up 63 bps compared to the first nine months of 2023, with the rate on interest-bearing deposits up 82 bps. The yield on average earning assets was up 46 bps, primarily driven by a 43 bp improvement in the loan yield. 
 
 We expect modest expansion in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2024, with this guidance assuming two 25 bp rate cuts by the Federal Reserve during the period. 
 The following tables detail the components of our net interest income (te) and net interest margin.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses expense of 18.6 million, compared to 8.7 million in the second quarter of 2024. The provision in the third quarter of 2024 included net charge-offs of 18.0 million and a reserve build of 0.6 million, compared to net charge-offs of 7.3 million and a reserve build of 1.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. A higher level of net charge-offs was the primary driver of the increase in provision expense linked quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans in the second quarter of 2024 was 0.30 , up from 0.12 , in the second quarter of 2024. The third quarter of 2024 net charge-offs included 14.5 million in the commercial portfolio, 3.5 million in the consumer portfolio and less than 0.1 million in the residential mortgage portfolio. The second quarter of 2024 net charge-offs included 4.1 million in the commercial portfolio and 3.3 million in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by net recoveries of 0.1 million in the residential mortgage portfolio. 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of 40.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 42.2 million for the same period in 2023. The provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 2024 included net charge-offs of 34.3 million and a reserve build of 6.0 million, compared to net charge-offs of 47.3 million and a reserve release of 5.2 million in the same period in 2023. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes a 29.7 million charge-off attributable to a single individually evaluated credit that stemmed from borrower-specific circumstances. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2024 of 34.3 million, or 0.19 of average loans, is comprised of net charge-offs of 23.8 million in the commercial portfolio and 10.7 million in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by net recoveries of 0.2 million in the residential mortgage portfolio. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2023 of 47.3 million, or 0.27 of average loans, is comprised of net charge-offs

 of 40.1 million in the commercial portfolio and 8.1 million in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by net recoveries of 0.8 million in the residential mortgage portfolio. 
 
 We expect to see modest charge-offs and provision for credit losses in the remainder of 2024. However, loan growth, portfolio mix, asset quality metrics and future assumptions in economic forecasts will drive the level of credit loss reserves. 
 The discussion labeled "Allowance for Credit Losses and Asset Quality" that appears later in this Item provides additional information on these changes and on general credit quality. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income totaled 95.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 6.7 million, or 8 , from the second quarter of 2024. The increase in noninterest income from the second quarter of 2024 is primarily driven by increases in our specialty lines, with growth across most revenue lines. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled 272.9 million, up 23.4 million, or 9 , from the same period in 2023. The increase is attributable to most fee income lines, partially offset by a decline in derivative income. A more detailed discussion of these and other noninterest income variances follows. 
 The components of noninterest income are presented in the following table for the indicated periods.

Service charges on deposit accounts are composed of overdraft fees, nonsufficient funds fees on business accounts, business and corporate account analysis fees, overdraft protection fees and other customer transaction-related charges. Service charges on deposits totaled 23.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 0.9 million, or 4 , compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in both consumer and business overdraft fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, services charges on deposits totaled 67.7 million, up 3.3 million, or 5 , from the same period in 2023. The year over year increase was driven primarily by analysis fees on business accounts as a result of activity levels, balance outflows and sales performance, and consumer and business overdraft fees, partially offset by a decline in consumer service charges as a result of the elimination of paper statement fees. 
 Trust fee income represents revenue generated from a full range of trust services, including asset management and custody services provided to individuals, businesses and institutions. Trust fees totaled 18.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 0.5 million, or 2 , from the second quarter of 2024, largely attributable to decreases in personal trust revenue as a result of seasonal tax preparation fees recorded in the prior quarter . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, trust fees totaled 53.6 million, an increase of 2.8 million, or 6 , from the same period in 2023. The year over year increase was primarily attributable to personal and institutional trust revenue, driven by market value and sales volumes. 
 Bank card and ATM fees include interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions, fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, and fees earned from ATM transactions. Bank card and ATM fees totaled 21.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 0.2 million, or 1 , from the second quarter of 2024. The linked quarter decrease was primarily driven by a decline in merchant fees. Bank card and ATM fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 64.1 million, up 1.8 million, or 3 , from the same period in 2023. The year over year change was driven primarily by increases in purchasing card activity and merchant fees, partially offset by a decline in ATM fees. 
 Investment and annuity fees and insurance commissions, which include both fees earned from sales of annuity and insurance products, as well as managed account fees, totaled 10.9 million, up 1.1 million, or 11 , from the second quarter of 2024. The linked-quarter increase was largely driven by sales volume for annuities, fixed income trading and insurance, and to an increase in recurring fees as a result of higher market values of securities. Investment and annuity fees and insurance commissions for the nine months ended 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 September 30, 2024 totaled 32.5 million, up 6.9 million, or 27 , from the same period in 2023. The year over year increase includes a 3.0 million increase in investment fees, and a 4.3 million increase in annuity fees and other investment fees, reflective of continued strong annuity sales performance and fixed-income trading commissions amid the elevated interest rate environment and favorable market conditions, partially offset by a 0.5 million decline in corporate underwriting fees. 
 Income from secondary mortgage market operations is comprised of income produced from the origination and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We offer a full range of mortgage products to our customers and typically sell longer-term fixed-rate loans while retaining the majority of adjustable-rate loans, as well as loans generated through programs to support customer relationships. Secondary mortgage market operations income will vary based on mortgage application volume, pull through rates, the percentage of loans ultimately sold in the secondary market and the timing of such sales. Income from secondary mortgage market operations was 3.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 0.2 million, or 5 , from the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income from secondary mortgage market operations totaled 9.8 million, up 2.7 million, or 39 , from the same period in 2023. The year over year increase was largely driven by an upward trend in the percentage of mortgage loans sold in the secondary market as opposed to those held in our portfolio. 
 Income from bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) is typically generated through insurance benefit proceeds as well as the growth of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held. Income from BOLI was 4.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 0.6 million, or 16 , from the second quarter of 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in mortality gains. Income from BOLI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 12.4 million, up 2.1 million, or 20 , from the same period in 2023 and is reflective of increases in both income from mortality gains and changes in cash surrender value. 
 Credit-related fees include fees assessed on letters of credit and unused portions of loan commitments. Credit-related fees were 2.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 0.2 million, or 7 , compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in standby letter of credit fees. Credit-related fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 9.2 million, down 0.1 million, or 1 , from the same period in 2023. Income from these products will vary based on letters of credit issued, credit line utilization and prevailing assessment rates. 
 Income or loss from customer and other derivatives is largely from our customer interest rate derivative program. Income from customer and other derivatives totaled 0.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of 1.1 million in the second quarter of 2024. Derivative income can be volatile and is dependent upon the composition of the portfolio, volume and mix of sales and termination activity, and market value adjustments due to market interest rate movement. The linked-quarter improvement is largely reflective of 1.4 million of expense resulting from assumption changes to the Visa B derivative liability recorded in the prior quarter that did not recur. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss from customer and other derivatives totaled 2.9 million, compared to income of 1.6 million for the same period in 2023. The current period includes a 1.5 million loss resulting from assumption changes associated with customer derivatives recorded in the first quarter of 2024 and a 0.5 million unfavorable variance in income from the Visa B derivative liability. The remainder of the year-over-year decline is largely a result of changes in the interest rate environment in each of the comparative periods, which affects demand for variable rate loans and related derivative products, valuation adjustments, and related collateral income/expense for the program as a whole . 
 Net gains on sales of premises, equipment and other assets consists primarily of net revenue earned from sales of excess-bank owned facilities and equipment no longer in use, gains on sales of Small Business Administration (SBA) and other non-residential mortgage loans, and leases and other assets associated with the equipment finance line of business. Net gains on sales of premises, equipment and other assets totaled 2.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The linked-quarter increase was largely driven by gains on sales of SBA loans. Net gains on sales of premises, equipment and other assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 6.8 million, compared to 2.3 million in the same period in 2023. The year over year increase was largely driven by an increase in the volume of SBA loan sales and income earned from such, and gains on the sale of bank premises and equipment. The level of net gains or losses on sales of these assets in a given reporting period will vary based on a variety of circumstances. 
 Other miscellaneous income is comprised of various items, including income from investments in small business investment companies (SBIC), Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock dividends, and fees from loan syndication and other specialty lines of business. Other miscellaneous income totaled 7.7 million, up 1.3 million, or 20 . The linked-quarter change was largely driven by increases of 0.7 million in SBIC income and 0.2 million in loan syndication fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other miscellaneous income totaled 19.9 million, up 3.9 million, or 24 , from the same period in 2023, the primary driver of which was a 2.2 million increase in dividends on FHLB stock. 
 We expect noninterest income to be up six to seven percent for the full year of 2024 from the 2023 adjusted noninterest income of 337.7 million.

 Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 203.8 million, down 2.2 million, or 1 , from the second quarter of 2024, with decreases in personnel expense, other miscellaneous losses and deposit insurance and regulatory fees, partially offset by an increase in professional services expense and a decrease in net gains from other real estate and foreclosed asset. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled 617.6 million, up 9.9 million, or 2 , from the same period in 2023. Year to date noninterest expense includes a 3.8 million supplemental disclosure item attributable to an FDIC special assessment. Excluding the impact of the supplemental disclosure item, noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was up 6.1 million, or 1 , from the same period in 2023. The year over year increase was largely driven by personnel expense and data processing expense, partially offset by a decrease in net other retirement expense. A more detailed discussion of these and other noninterest expense variances follows.

Personnel expense consists of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and insurance for medical, life and disability. Personnel expense totaled 115.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 3.0 million, or 2 , from the previous quarter. The linked quarter variance reflects a decrease in full-time equivalent employees and higher salary deferrals, partially offset by an increase in incentive-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, personnel expense totaled 355.7 million, up 9.2 million, or 3 , from the same period in 2023. The year over year change reflects annual increases across most salary and benefit categories that were partially offset by savings attributable to a decrease in headcount. 
 Occupancy and equipment expenses are primarily composed of lease expenses, depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other equipment expenses. Occupancy and equipment expenses totaled 18.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 0.7 million, or 4 , from the prior quarter, with increased cost associated with general repairs, maintenance and utilities, partially offset by decreases in leased facility expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, occupancy and equipment expenses totaled 53.2 million, up 0.3 million, or 1 , from the same period in 2023.

 Data processing expense includes expenses related to third party technology processing and servicing costs, technology project costs and fees associated with bank card and ATM transactions, and credit card reward expenses, and may vary with transaction volume and timing of technology enhancement initiatives. Data processing expense was 31.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 0.2 million, or 1 , from the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, data processing expense totaled 91.2 million up 3.7 million, or 4 , from the same period in 2023, driven in part by certain activity-based processing fees, expenses associated with ongoing technology enhancements, increases in card rewards expense, and ATM servicing arrangement costs, as the current period reflects a full nine months of expense associated with an arrangement entered into in 2023. 
 Professional services expense includes accounting and audit, legal, consulting and certain outsourced service expense. Professional services expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 11.0 million, up 1.5 million, or 16 , from the second quarter of 2024, with increases in most categories. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, professional services expense totaled 29.5 million, up 1.9 million, or 7 , from the same period in 2023, primarily driven by expenses incurred for certain outsourcing initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees. Professional service expense may vary from period to period, generally related to consulting and legal needs. 
 Deposit insurance and regulatory fees for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 5.5 million, down 0.5 million, or 9 , from the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, deposit insurance and regulatory fees totaled 20.4 million, up 2.2 million, or 12 , from the same period in 2023. Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is a supplemental disclosure item of 3.8 million attributable to a special assessment by the FDIC to cover losses incurred under the systemic risk exception following the failure of two large regional banks. Excluding the impact of the supplemental disclosure item, both the linked-quarter and year over year changes in deposit insurance and regulatory fees were primarily attributable to modest changes in our risk-based assessment calculation. 
 The FDIC special assessment expense recorded to date is management's estimate of our portion of the cost attributable to the systemic risk exception based on information from the FDIC. However, the loss estimates resulting from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank may be subject to further change pending the projected and actual outcome of loss share agreements, joint ventures, and outstanding litigation. The exact amount of losses incurred will not be determined until the FDIC terminates the receiverships of these banks; therefore, the exact exposure to the Company remains unknown. 
 Net gains from other real estate and foreclosed assets totaled 0.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.1 million in the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net gains from other real estate and foreclosed assets totaled 1.7 million, compared to 0.2 million for the same period in 2023. The level of net income or losses associated with maintaining the other real estate owned portfolio can vary depending on sales activity, valuation adjustments and income or expense associated with operating and maintaining foreclosed property. Gains or losses on the sale of other real estate and foreclosed assets may occur periodically and are dependent on the number and type of assets for sale and current market conditions. 
 Corporate value, franchise and other non-income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 4.7 million, down 0.4 million, or 8 , compared to the prior quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, corporate value, franchise and other non-income tax expense totaled 14.8 million, down 0.9 million, or 6 , from the same period in 2023. The linked-quarter and year over year declines are largely attributable to bank share tax. The calculation of bank share tax is based on multiple variables, including average quarterly assets, earnings and stockholders equity to determine the taxable assessment value. 
 Business development-related expenses (including advertising, travel, entertainment and contributions) totaled 7.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, virtually flat compared to the second quarter of 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, business development-related expenses totaled 22.3 million, down 0.1 million, or less than 1 , from the same period in 2023. The timing and level of business development expense can vary based on business needs and promotional campaigns. 
 All other expenses, excluding amortization of intangibles, is comprised of a variety of other operational expenses and losses, tax credit investment amortization, and net other retirement expense. All other expenses totaled 8.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 0.8 million, or 9 , from the second quarter of 2024, largely in other miscellaneous expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all other expenses totaled 24.9 million, down 3.2 million, or 11 , from the same period in 2023, driven in large part by a 3.5 million decrease in net other retirement expense. 
 We expect noninterest expense to be up one to two percent for the full year of 2024 from the 2023 adjusted noninterest expense of 810.7 million.

 Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 20.4 compared to 20.9 in the second quarter of 2024. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.0 , relatively unchanged from the same period in 2023. 
 Many factors impact the effective income tax rate including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income and relative impact of net tax benefits related to tax credit investments, tax-exempt interest income, bank-owned life insurance, and nondeductible expenses. Additionally, discrete tax items recognized in any given period affect the comparability of the effective income tax rate between periods. Such items include share-based compensation, valuation allowance changes, uncertain tax position changes and tax law changes. Based on the current forecast, management expects the effective income tax rate for 2024 will be in the 20 to 21 range, absent any changes in tax law. 
 Our effective tax rate has historically varied from the federal statutory rate primarily because of tax-exempt income and tax credits. Interest income on bonds issued by or loans to state and municipal governments and authorities, and earnings from the bank-owned life insurance program are the major components of tax-exempt income. The main source of tax credits has been investments in tax-advantaged securities and tax credit projects. These investments are made primarily in the markets we serve and are directed at tax credits issued under the Federal and State New Market Tax Credit NMTC programs, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit LIHTC programs, as well as pre-2018 Qualified Zone Academy Bonds QZAB and Qualified School Construction Bonds QSCB ). These investments generate tax credits, which reduce current and future taxes and are recognized when earned as a benefit in the provision for income taxes. 
 We have invested in NMTC projects through investments in our own Community Development Entities CDE ), as well as other unrelated CDEs. Federal tax credits from NMTC investments are recognized over a seven-year period, while recognition of the benefits from state tax credits varies from three to five years. We have also invested in affordable housing projects that generate federal LIHTC tax credits that are recognized over a ten-year period, beginning in the year the rental activity begins. The amortization of the LIHTC investment cost is recognized as a component of income tax expense in proportion to the tax credits recognized over the ten-year credit period. 
 Based on tax credit investments that have been made to date in 2024, we expect to realize benefits from federal and state tax credits over the next three years totaling 9.8 million, 8.2 million, and 8.0 million in 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. We intend to continue making investments in tax credit projects. However, our ability to access new credits will depend upon, among other factors, federal and state tax policies and the level of competition for such credits. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity management ensures that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, while also meeting the operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs of the Company, the Bank and other subsidiaries. As part of the overall asset and liability management process, liquidity management strategies and measurements have been developed to manage and monitor liquidity risk. The following table summarizes available liquidity at September 30, 2024:

 Liquidity levels of financial institutions continue to be in heightened focus since the failure of several major regional U.S. banks that experienced large-scale deposit runs in the first half of 2023. Dampened depositor confidence over a financial institution's ability to protect deposit balances in excess of the federally insured limit is thought to pose a higher likelihood of a deposit run, and, in turn, the risk that the institution may have insufficient liquidity to meet customer demand. At September 30, 2024, our available on and off-balance sheet liquidity of 19.8 billion is well in excess of our estimated uninsured, noncollateralized deposits of approximately 10.8 billion. 
 The asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments, maturities and repayments of investment securities and occasional sales of various assets. Short-term investments such as federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank or with other commercial banks are additional sources of liquidity to meet cash flow requirements. Free securities represent unpledged securities that can be sold or used as collateral for borrowings, and include unpledged securities assigned to short-term dealer repurchase agreements or to the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. Total pledged securities were 3.4 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.6 billion at June 30, 2024 and 4.7 billion at December 31, 2023. Management has established an internal target for the ratio of free securities to total securities of 20 or greater. As shown in the table below, our ratio of free securities to total securities was 56.52 at September 30, 2024, compared to 53.24 at June 30, 2024 and 38.80 December 31, 2023. The decrease in pledged securities and related increase in free securities compared to December 31, 2023 is the result of pledging of approximately 1.0 billion of FHLB letters of credit in lieu of securities in both the second and third quarters of 2024. Both securities and FHLB letters of credit are pledged as collateral related to public funds and repurchase agreements.

The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity mainly through the ability to use cash sourced from customer deposit accounts. At September 30, 2024, deposits totaled 29.0 billion, down 217.8 million from June 30, 2024 and 707.2 million from December 31, 2023. 
 Brokered time deposits at September 30, 2024 totaled 190.5 million, down 9.6 million from June 30, 2024 and down 399.3 million from December 31, 2023. The brokered deposits held at September 30, 2024 bear interest at a weighted average rate of 5.53 with maturities between November 2024 and February 2025. The decrease from both comparative periods is attributable to net maturities of instruments that were not replaced. The use of brokered deposits as a funding source is subject to certain policies regarding the amount, term and interest rate. 
 Core deposits consist of total deposits excluding certificates of deposit of 250,000 or more and brokered deposits. Core deposits totaled 26.9 billion at September 30, 2024, down 233.1 million, or 1 , from June 30, 2024 and down 525.6 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023. Changes in the level of core deposits will vary based on the level of total deposits and the mix therein. The ratio of core deposits to total deposits was 92.95 at September 30, 2024, compared to 93.06 at June 30, 2024 and 92.51 at December 31, 2023. 
 Purchases of federal funds, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings from customers provide additional sources of liquidity to meet short-term funding requirements. Besides funding from customer sources, the Bank has a line of credit with the FHLB that is secured by blanket pledges of certain mortgage loans. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had 300 million in borrowings and approximately 5.6 billion available under this line. The unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve s discount window is approximately 3.3 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve at any date during any period covered by this report. 
 Wholesale funds, which are comprised of short-term borrowings, long-term debt and brokered deposits were 6.28 of core deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to 6.63 at June 30, 2024 and 7.21 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, wholesale funds totaled 1.7 billion, a decrease of 107.6 million, or 6 , from June 30, 2024 and 288.0 million, or 15 , from December 31, 2023. The amount of wholesale funds outstanding will vary based on retail deposit levels and current funding needs. The Company has established an internal target for wholesale funds to be less than 25 of core deposits. 
 Other key measures used to monitor liquidity include the liquid asset ratio and the loan-to-deposit ratio. The liquid asset ratio (liquid assets, consisting of cash, short-term investments and free securities, divided by total liabilities) measures our ability to meet 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 short-term obligations. Our liquid asset ratio was 18.38 at September 30, 2024, compared to 16.30 at June 30, 2024 and 12.69 at December 31, 2023. Management has established a minimum liquid asset ratio of 7.5 and an internal target of 12 or greater. The loan to deposit ratio (average loans outstanding for the reporting period divided by average deposits outstanding) measures the amount of funds the Company lends for each dollar of deposits on hand. Our average loan-to-deposit ratio for the third quarter of 2024 was 81.38 , compared to 82.28 for the second quarter of 2024 and 79.39 for the fourth quarter of 2023. Management has an established target range for the loan-to-deposit ratio of 87 to 89 , but will operate outside that range under certain circumstances. 
 Cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Part I, Item 1 of this document present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Dividends received from the Bank have been the primary source of funds available to the Parent for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for servicing its debt. The liquidity management process takes into account the various regulatory provisions that can limit the amount of dividends the Bank can distribute to the Parent. The Parent targets cash and other liquid assets to provide liquidity in an amount sufficient to fund approximately six quarters of ongoing cash or liquid asset needs, consisting primarily of common stockholder dividends, debt service requirements, and any expected share repurchase or early extinguishment of debt. The Parent may operate below the target level on a temporary basis if a return to the target can be achieved in the near-term, generally not to exceed four quarters. The Parent had cash and liquid assets of 253.8 million at September 30, 2024, exceeding our internal target. 
 Capital Resources 
 Stockholders equity totaled 4.2 billion at September 30, 2024, up 254.0 million, or 6 , from June 30, 2024 and 371.0 million, or 10 from December 31, 2023. The increase from June 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to other comprehensive income of 182.4 million, net income of 115.6 million and 6.4 million of long-term incentive plan and dividend reinvestment activity. These factors were partially offset by dividends of 35.1 million and share repurchases of 15.4 million. The increase from December 31, 2023 is attributable to net income of 338.7 million, other comprehensive income of 145.6 million, and 13.5 million of long-term incentive plan and dividend reinvestment activity, partially offset by 96.9 million of dividends, and 30.0 million of share repurchases. 
 The tangible common equity (TCE) ratio was 9.56 at September 30, 2024, up 79 bps from 8.77 at June 30, 2024, driven primarily by other comprehensive income (+52 bps), tangible net earnings (+34 bps), a decrease in tangible assets (+5 bps) and stock-based compensation activity (+2 bps), partially offset by dividends (-10 bps) and common share repurchases (-4 bps). 
 The regulatory capital ratios of the Company and the Bank at September 30, 2024 remained well in excess of current regulatory minimum requirements, including capital conservation buffers, by at least 1.1 billion. The Company and the Bank have been categorized as well-capitalized in the most recent notices received from our regulators. Refer to the Supervision and Regulation section in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion of our capital requirements. 
 The following table shows the regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as calculated under current rules for the indicated periods. The capital ratios reflect the election to use the CECL five-year transition rule that allowed for the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (0 in 2020 and 2021), followed by a three-year transition (25 in 2022, 50 in 2023, 75 in 2024, and 100 thereafter). The two-year delay included the full impact of January 1, 2020 cumulative effect impact plus an estimated impact of CECL calculated quarterly as 25 of the current ACL over the January 1, 2020 balance (modified transition amount). The modified transition amount was recalculated each quarter in 2020 and 2021, with the December 31, 2021 impact of 24.9 million plus a day one impact of 44.1 million (net of tax) carrying through the remaining three years of the transition, as adjusted by the applicable transition percentage, equating to 17.2 million at September 30, 2024.

 We regularly perform stress analysis on our capital levels. One such scenario includes the hypothetical impact of including accumulated other comprehensive losses on market valuations of available for sale securities and cash flow hedges in regulatory capital and a further stress scenario that includes both those losses plus losses on the held to maturity investment portfolio in regulatory capital. We estimate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain in excess of the well-capitalized minimums under both of these stress scenarios at September 30, 2024. 
 On July 25, 2024, our board of directors declared the regular quarterly common stock cash dividend of 0.40 per share. The quarterly common stock cash dividend was paid on September 16, 2024 to shareholders of record on September 5, 2024. The Company has paid uninterrupted dividends to its shareholders since 1967. 
 On January 26, 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 4,297,000 shares of the Company s common stock (approximately 5 of the shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022). The authorization is set to expire on December 31, 2024. The shares may be repurchased in the open market, by block purchase, through accelerated share repurchase plans, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in one or more transactions, from time to time, depending upon market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under this program and the repurchase authorization may be terminated or amended by the Board at any time prior to the expiration date. During the third quarter of 2024, 300,000 shares were repurchased under this program at an average price of 50.63 per share, inclusive of commissions. At September 30, 2024, 612,993 shares had been repurchased under this program at an average price of 48.63 per share, inclusive of commissions. The Company has accrued an estimated excise tax liability on net share repurchases of 0.2 million at September 30, 2024. 
 BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 Short-Term Investments 
 Short-term assets are held to ensure funds are available to meet the cash flow needs of both borrowers and depositors. Short-term investments, including interest-bearing bank deposits and federal funds sold, were 795.2 million at September 30, 2024, up 213.6 million from June 30, 2024 and 168.1 million from December 31, 2023. Average short-term investments of 466.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 were up 83.4 million from the second quarter of 2024. Year-to-date average short term investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 461.0 million, down 143.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. Typically, the balance of short-term investments will change on a daily basis depending upon movement in customer loan and deposit accounts. The comparative average balance for the nine months ended September 2023 was impacted by excess liquidity held in response to the disruption in the financial industry caused by bank failures. 
 Securities 
 The purpose of the securities portfolio is to increase profitability, mitigate interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory pledging requirements. Our securities portfolio includes securities categorized as available for sale and held to maturity. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value and may be sold prior to maturity. Unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders' equity. 
 Investment in securities totaled 7.8 billion at September 30, 2024, up 233.9 million, or 3 , from June 30, 2024 and 169.8 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023. The increases from June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were largely driven by favorable increases in the fair valuation adjustment on the available for sale portfolio of 191.5 million and 132.4 million, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, securities available for sale totaled 5.3 billion and securities held to maturity totaled 2.5 billion. 
 Our securities portfolio consists mainly of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations that are issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. We invest only in high quality investment grade securities with a targeted portfolio effective duration generally between two and five and a half years. At September 30, 2024, the average expected maturity of the portfolio was 5.78 years with an effective duration of 4.25 years and a nominal weighted-average yield of 2.62 . Under an immediate, parallel rate shock using increases of 100 bps and 200 bps, the effective durations would be 4.33 and 4.35 years, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the average expected maturity of the portfolio was 6.22 years with an effective duration of 4.60 years and a nominal weighted-average yield of 2.48 . The changes in expected maturity, effective duration, and nominal weighted-average yield were largely the result of maturities and paydowns and reinvestment in the portfolio during the year. At September 30, 2024, approximately 514 million of our available for sale securities are hedged with 478 million in fair value hedges in order to provide protection and flexibility to reposition and/or reprice the portfolio in a rising interest rate environment, effectively reducing the duration (market price risk) on the hedged securities.

 At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the securities portfolio for credit loss. Based on our assessments, expected credit loss was not material for any period presented, and therefore no allowance for credit loss was recorded. 
 Loans 
 Total loans at September 30, 2024 were 23.5 billion, down 456.0 million, or 2 , from June 30, 2024 and down 466.3 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease in loans from both comparative periods reflects a decline in our shared national credit portfolio as we remain focused on originating more granular loans and higher pay-offs on income producing commercial real estate loans, discussed in more detail below.

Commercial and industrial C I loans includes both non-real estate and owner occupied real estate secured loans. The Bank lends mainly to middle market and smaller commercial entities, although it participates in larger shared credit loan facilities. C I totaled 12.7 billion at September 30, 2024, down 257.5 million, or 2 , from June 30, 2024 and down 366.6 million, or 3 , from December 31, 2023. The decreases from both comparative periods are reflective of our strategic reduction of exposure to shared national credits. In addition, loan growth in this portfolio segment has tempered, as demand has been affected by the interest rate environment. 
 Shared national credits outstanding at September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 2.28 billion, or 9.7 of total loans, down 253.6 million from June 30, 2024 and down 340.5 million from December 31, 2023. The decline from both comparative periods was driven by the previously mentioned strategic reduction of exposure to large credit-only relationships. At September 30, 2024, our larger concentrations in shared national credits includes approximately 336 million of manufacturing credits, 329 million of real estate rental and leasing credits, 318 million of healthcare-related credits, and 310 million of finance and insurance credits, with the remainder of the balance in other diverse industries. 
 Our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. Nevertheless, we may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to different borrowers or groups of borrowers, specific types of collateral, industries, loan products, or regions. The following table provides detail of the more significant industry concentrations for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which is based on NAICS codes for all industries, with the exception of energy, which is based on the borrower s source of revenue (i.e. a manufacturer whose income is derived from energy-related business is reported as energy).

Commercial real estate - income producing loans totaled approximately 4.0 billion at September 30, 2024, down 65.2 million, or 2 , from June 30, 2024 and up 1.7 million, or less than 1 , from December 31, 2023. Construction and land development loans totaled approximately 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, down 104.8 million, or 7 , from June 30, 2024, and down 127.5 million, or 8 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease in commercial real estate - income producing loans was largely driven by payoffs and paydowns outpacing loan growth, including transfers of construction loans moving to permanent financing. The declines in both commercial real estate - income producing and construction loan portfolios is reflective of our efforts to limit our growth in income producing real estate with a focus on resilient projects given the current economic environment. The following table details the end-of-period aggregated commercial real estate - income producing and construction loan balances by property type. Loans reflected in 1-4 family residential construction include both loans to construction builders as well as single family borrowers.

The residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled 4.0 billion at September 30, 2024, virtually flat compared to June 30, 2024 and up 102.2 million, or 3 , from December 31, 2023. The composition of the residential mortgage loan portfolio will depend on the volume of loans originated and the percentage ultimately sold in the secondary market. 
 The consumer loan portfolio totaled 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024, down 16.7 million, or 1 , from June 30, 2024 and down 76.2 million, or 5 , from December 31, 2023. Changes in the consumer loan portfolio reflect both slowing demand and the impact of our exit from the indirect automobile lending market, where the existing portfolio is in run-off. The indirect loan portfolio totaled 24.2 million at September 30, 2024, down 8.0 million from June 30, 2024 and down 28.3 million from December 31, 2023. 
 Average loans for the third quarter of 2024 of 23.6 billion were down 365.4 million, or 2 , compared to the second quarter of 2024. 
 Management expects December 31, 2024 period-end loans to be flat or down slightly compared to the December 31, 2023 balance of 23.9 billion.

 Allowance for Credit Losses and Asset Quality 
 Our allowance for credit losses was 342.8 million at September 30, 2024, up 0.6 million from June 30, 2024 and 6.0 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses from June 30, 2024 is attributable to an 18.6 million provision for credit losses, partially offset by 18.0 million of net charge-offs. Our overall credit loss outlook is not significantly different from that at June 30, 2024. However, uncertainty related to ongoing inflationary pressure, elevated interest rates and the outcome of the Federal Reserve s actions with respect to monetary policy, and stress in the commercial real estate sector continues to result in an elevated reserve relative to pre-pandemic levels. The allowance for loan loss increased 1.1 million and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments decreased 0.6 million from June 30, 2024. The modest increase in the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 reflects a relatively consistent credit loss outlook with continued focus on risks that impact certain segments of our loan portfolio, resulting in modest allowance builds across several portfolios. The decline in the reserve for unfunded commitments compared to June 30, 2024 was largely volume driven. 
 We utilized the September 2024 Moody's economic scenarios to inform our allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024. After considering the variables underlying each of the Moody's economic scenarios, management probability-weighed the baseline scenario at 40 and the downside S-2 mild recessionary scenario at 60 in the computation of the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, consistent with the weighting used in the prior quarter. Each of the scenarios considered have varying degrees of severity and duration of inflationary pressure, including volatility in commodities prices and impacts to the labor market, the consequences of the Federal Reserve's actions with regard to monetary policy, the effects of disruption in the financial services industry, and impacts from geopolitical unrest. Refer to the Economic Outlook section of this discussion and analysis for further information on the Moody s scenarios and our weighting assumptions. 
 Our allowance for credit losses coverage to total loans was 1.46 at September 30, 2024, up from 1.43 at June 30, 2024 and 1.41 at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on the commercial portfolio totaled 272.8 million, or 1.51 of that portfolio, at September 30, 2024, up from 273.8 million, or 1.48 , at June 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on the residential mortgage portfolio totaled 42.9 million, or 1.07 of that portfolio, at September 30, 2024, up from 41.7 million, or 1.04 , at June 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on the consumer portfolio totaled 27.1 million, or 1.97 of that portfolio, at September 30, 2024, up from 26.7 million, or 1.93 , at June 30, 2024. 
 Criticized commercial loans totaled 508.0 million at September 30, 2024, up 128.2 million, or 34 , from 379.8 million at June 30, 2024 and 234.3 million, or 86 , from 273.7 million at December 31, 2023. Criticized loans are defined as those having potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention (risk-rated as special mention, substandard and doubtful), including both accruing and nonaccruing loans. The Company routinely assesses the ratings of loans in its portfolio through an established and comprehensive portfolio management process. In addition, the Company often reviews portfolios of loans to determine if there are areas of risk not specifically identified in its loan by loan approach. Criticized commercial loans comprised 2.81 of that portfolio at September 30, 2024, up from 2.05 at June 30, 2024 and 1.47 at December 31, 2023. Management believes the migration in the level of criticized loans to be mostly indicative of continued normalization compared to the earlier post-pandemic benign credit environment, including certain downgrades resulting from the most recent regulatory examination of loans within our shared national credit portfolio. We remain focused on identifying specific and broader risk indicators that may be impacting certain segments in our portfolio, and we have not seen signs of significant weakening in any particular industry, sector or geographic segment beyond what we believe has been experienced by the banking industry as a whole. Our criticized commercial loans at September 30, 2024 are diversified across many industries, with the largest concentrations being wholesale trade, totaling 83.5 million; manufacturing, totaling 74.8 million; transportation and warehousing, totaling 73.8 million; construction, totaling 56.9 million; real estate and rental and leasing, totaling 53.4 million; retail trade, totaling 45.8 million; accommodation, food services and entertainment, totaling 28.3 million; and professional, scientific, and technical services, totaling 21.7 million. Commercial loans risk rated pass-watch totaled 477.4 million at September 30, 2024, up 26.9 million, or 6 , from June 30, 2024 and up 43.7 million, or 10 , from December 31, 2023. The pass-watch risk rating includes credits with negative performance trends that reflect sufficient risk to cause concern, but have not risen to the level of criticized. 
 Net charge-offs were 18.0 million, or 0.30 of average total loans on an annualized basis in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 7.3 million, or 0.12 in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in net charge-offs compared to the prior quarter was driven by commercial loans where charge-off levels can vary from period-to-period due to the larger size of credits. The third quarter of 2024 net charge-offs included 14.5 million in the commercial portfolio, 3.5 million in the consumer portfolio and less than 0.1 million in the residential mortgage portfolio. The second quarter of 2024 net charge-offs included 4.1 million in the commercial portfolio and 3.3 million in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by net recoveries of 0.1 million in the residential mortgage portfolio.

Nonaccrual loans plus ORE and foreclosed assets totaled 110.6 million at September 30, 2024, up 22.2 million from June 30, 2024 and 47.9 million from December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans of 82.9 million decreased 3.4 million from June 30, 2024 and increased 23.8 million from December 31, 2023. Despite the increase in the level of nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2023, the ratio to total loans remains relatively low at 0.35 of the total portfolio and we believe is largely representative of a continued normalization of credit metrics following a mostly benign credit environment in recent years. ORE and foreclosed assets were 27.7 million at September 30, 2024, up 25.6 million from June 30, 2024, and 24.1 million from December 31, 2023, with the increase from both comparative periods largely attributable to foreclosed property from one commercial borrower. Nonaccrual loans plus ORE and other foreclosed assets as a percentage of total loans, ORE and other foreclosed assets was 0.47 at September 30, 2024, up 10 bps from June 30, 2024 and 21 bps from December 31, 2023. 
 We expect to continue to see modest charge-offs and provision for credit losses for the remainder of 2024. Loan growth, portfolio mix, asset quality metrics and future assumptions in economic forecasts will drive the level of credit loss reserves. 
 Deposits

 The failures of several large U.S. banks in the first half of 2023 created disruption in the financial services industry. While many factors played a role in the ultimate failures, these institutions had significant industry/demographic concentration within their deposit bases and a high ratio of uninsured deposits. Lack of diversity in concentration within a deposit base may increase the risk of events or trends that could prompt a larger-scale demand for deposits outflow. Concerns over a financial institution's ability to protect deposit balances in excess of the federally insured limit may increase the risk of a deposit run. We consider our deposit base to be seasoned, stable and well-diversified. We also offer our customers an insured cash sweep product (ICS) that allows customers to secure deposits above FDIC insured limits. We continue to see demand for the ICS product, with the balance totaling 376.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 403.9 million at June 30, 2024 and 303.8 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we have calculated our average deposit account size by dividing period-end deposits by the population of accounts with balances to be approximately 36,900, which includes 196,300 in our commercial and small business lines (excluding public funds), 123,300 in our wealth management business line, and 18,500 in our consumer business line. 
 Further, at September 30, 2024, our sources of liquidity exceed uninsured deposits. We have estimated the Bank s amount of uninsured deposits using the methodologies and assumptions required for FDIC regulatory reporting to be approximately 13.8 billion at September 30, 2024, virtually unchanged compared to both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our uninsured deposit total at September 30, 2024 includes approximately 3.0 billion of public funds that have pledged securities as collateral, leaving approximately 10.8 billion of noncollateralized, uninsured deposits compared to total liquidity of 19.8 billion. Our ratio of noncollateralized, uninsured deposits to total deposits was approximately 37.1 at September 30, 2024, compared to 35.9 at June 30, 2024 and 34.4 at December 31, 2023. 
 Total deposits were 29.0 billion at September 30, 2024, down 217.8 million, or 1 , from June 30, 2024 and down 707.2 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023. Average deposits for the third quarter of 2024 were 28.9 billion, down 128.9 million, or less than 1 , from the second quarter of 2024.

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled 10.5 billion at September 30, 2024, down 142.7 million, or 1 , from June 30, 2024 and 531.0 million, or 5 , from December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 36 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, unchanged compared to June 30, 2024 and down slightly from 37 at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposit levels have trended downward in recent quarters as customers shift to interest-bearing products amid the elevated interest rate environment and as consumer and business spending remains strong. The current level of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits of 36 represents what we consider to be a more typical, pre-pandemic mix of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits. 
 Interest-bearing transaction and savings accounts totaled 10.9 billion at September 30, 2024, up 78.6 million, or 1 , from June 30, 2024 and 222.0 million, or 2 , from December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing public fund deposits totaled 2.7 billion at September 30, 2024, down 217.6 million, or 7 , from June 30, 2024 and down 438.9 million, or 14 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease in public funds deposits from both comparative periods is mostly reflective of typical seasonal outflows as the calendar year approaches the fourth quarter. Retail time deposits totaled 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024, up 73.5 million, or 2 , from June 30, 2024 and 440.1 million, or 10 , from December 31, 2023. Despite maturity concentrations and promotional rate reductions during the period, retail time deposits increased linked-quarter as rate offerings remain attractive. Brokered time deposits totaled 190.5 million at September 30, 2024, down 9.6 million from June 30, 2024 and 399.3 million from December 31, 2023 as a result of net maturities of instruments that were not replaced. Our brokered deposits bear interest at a weighted average rate of 5.53 with maturities between November 2024 and February 2025.

 The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.15 , up slightly from 3.14 in the second quarter of 2024, with increases in the rates paid on interest-bearing transaction and savings deposits being mostly offset by decreases in rates paid on time deposits and public funds deposits offsetting. Rates paid on deposits will vary based on prevailing interest rates and promotional rate offerings on the various product types. The following table sets forth average balances and weighted-average rates paid on deposits for the third and second quarters of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023.

Management expects December 31, 2024 period-end deposits to be flat to down slightly from the December 31, 2023 balance of 29.7 billion. 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 At September 30, 2024, short-term borrowings totaled 1.3 billion, down 98.0 million from June 30, 2024 and up 111.1 million from December 31, 2023. Changes from June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflect decreases in FHLB advances of 350 million and 400 million, respectively, with the remainder of the variances attributable to fluctuations in customer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased. Average short-term borrowings of 972.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 were down 166.7 million, or 15 , from the second quarter of 2024. 
 Short-term borrowings are a core portion of the Company s funding strategy and can fluctuate depending on our funding needs and the sources utilized. Customer repurchase agreements and FHLB borrowings are the major sources of short-term borrowings. Customer repurchase agreements are offered mainly to commercial customers to assist them with their cash management strategies or to provide a temporary investment vehicle for their excess liquidity pending redeployment for corporate or investment purposes. While customer repurchase agreements provide a recurring source of funds to the Bank, amounts available will vary. FHLB borrowings are funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank that are collateralized by certain residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans included in the Bank s loan portfolio, subject to specific criteria. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 Long-term debt totaled 236.4 million at September 30, 2024, virtually unchanged from June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Long-term debt at September 30, 2024 includes subordinated notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of 172.5 million, a stated maturity of June 15, 2060, and a fixed rate of 6.25 per annum that qualify as Tier 2 capital of certain regulatory capital ratios. Subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve, the Company may redeem these notes in whole or in part on any of its quarterly interest payment dates after June 15, 2025.

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit 
 In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into financial instruments, such as commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of its customers. Such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded, although they expose the Bank to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans. Under regulatory capital guidelines, the Company and Bank must include unfunded commitments meeting certain criteria in risk-weighted capital calculations. 
 Commitments to extend credit include revolving commercial credit lines, non-revolving loan commitments issued mainly to finance the acquisition and development or construction of real property or equipment, and credit card and personal credit lines. The availability of funds under commercial credit lines and loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and other contractual conditions. Loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates. A number of commercial and personal credit lines are used only partially or, in some cases, not at all before they expire, and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements. 
 A substantial majority of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the Bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform. The Bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors of essential goods and services. 
 The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect our exposure to credit risk. The Bank undertakes the same credit evaluation in making loan commitments and assuming conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a reserve for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments totaling 25.5 million. 
 The following table shows the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at September 30, 2024 according to expiration date.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 There were no material changes or developments during the reporting period with respect to methodologies that the Company uses when applying what management believes are critical accounting policies and developing critical accounting estimates as disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with those generally practiced within the banking industry which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and the resulting estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our primary market risk is interest rate risk that stems from uncertainty with respect to the absolute and relative levels of future market interest rates that affect our financial products and services. In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, management measures the sensitivity of our net interest income and cash flows under various market interest rate scenarios,

 establishes interest rate risk management policies and implements asset/liability management strategies designed to promote a relatively stable net interest margin under varying rate environments. 
 Net Interest Income at Risk 
 The following table presents an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in net interest income resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in rates at September 30, 2024. Shifts are measured in 100 basis point increments in a range from -500 to +500 basis points from base case, with -300 through +300 basis points presented in the table below. Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions including loan and deposit repricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments and other factors. The base scenario assumes that the current interest rate environment is held constant over a 24-month forecast period and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income. Policy limits on the change in net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios are approved by the Board of Directors. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled.

The results indicate a general asset sensitivity across most scenarios driven primarily by repricing of cash flows in the investment and loan portfolios. As short-term rates have remained elevated, the funding mix has shifted to more rate sensitive deposits and wholesale sources resulting in lower overall net interest income at risk as deposit repricing is expected to offset rate adjustments in the floating rate loan book. Furthermore, due to the funding mix shift, the Company is currently less sensitive to changes in short-term rate movements with interest rate risk being driven more by changes in the mid to long-term segment of the yield curve. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk with on- or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. 
 Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as anticipated. Additionally, a change in the U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to net interest income than indicated above. Strategic management of our balance sheet and earnings is fluid and would be adjusted to accommodate these movements. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets such as adjustable-rate loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Also, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. All of these factors are considered in monitoring exposure to interest rate risk. 
 Economic Value of Equity (EVE) 
 EVE simulation involves calculating the present value of all future cash flows from assets and subtracting the present value of all future cash outflows from liabilities including the impact of off-balance sheet items such as interest rate hedges. This analysis results in a theoretical market value of the bank's equity or EVE. Management s focus on EVE analysis is not on the resulting calculation of EVE itself, but instead on the sensitivity of EVE to changes in market rates. Policy limits on the change in EVE under a variety of interest rate scenarios are approved by the Board of Directors. The following table presents an analysis of the change in the Bank s 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 EVE resulting from instantaneous and parallel shifts in rates as of September 30, 2024. Shifts are measured in 100 basis point increments ranging from -500 to +500 basis points from base case, with -300 through +300 basis points presented in table below.

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Boards of Directors. Because EVE measures the present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not consider factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, possible hedging activities, or changing product spreads, each of which could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
