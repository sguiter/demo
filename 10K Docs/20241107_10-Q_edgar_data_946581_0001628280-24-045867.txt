 Deferred Revenue 
 We record deferred revenue when payments are due or received in advance of the fulfillment of our associated performance obligations. The balance of deferred revenue, including current and non-current balances as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 were and , respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the additions to our deferred revenue balance were due primarily to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the reductions to our deferred revenue balance were due primarily to the recognition of revenue upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of revenue was recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the respective period. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of revenue was recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the respective period.

We expect to recognize approximately of this balance as revenue over the next months, and the remainder thereafter. This balance does not include an estimate for variable consideration arising from sales-based royalty license revenue in excess of the contractual minimum guarantee. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, our contract asset balances were and , respectively.

 over the term of the agreement and a maximum annual bonus opportunity of over the term of the agreement, based on the Company achieving certain performance thresholds. In connection with the 2022 Management Agreement, we have granted and expect to grant time-based and performance-based restricted units to ZMC. 
 In consideration for ZMC's services, we recorded consulting expense in General and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units granted to ZMC, which is also included in General and administrative expenses, of and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Time-based restricted stock units granted pursuant to the 2022 Management Agreement in fiscal year 2025 will vest on June 1, 2025, June 1, 2026, and June 1, 2027, and those granted in fiscal year 2024, partially vested on June 1, 2024 and will also vest June 1, 2025 and June 1, 2026. Time-based restricted stock units granted in fiscal year 2023, partially vested on June 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 and will also vest June 1, 2025. 
 Market-based restricted stock units granted pursuant to the 2022 Management Agreement in fiscal year 2025 are eligible to vest on June 1, 2027, those granted in fiscal year 2024 are eligible to vest on June 1, 2026, and those granted in fiscal year 2023 are eligible to vest on June 1, 2025. Market-based restricted stock units are eligible to vest based on the Company's Total Shareholder Return (as defined in the relevant grant agreement) relative to the Total Shareholder Return (as defined in the relevant grant agreement) of the companies that constitute the NASDAQ 100 index under the 2022 Management Agreement (as defined in the relevant grant agreement) as of the grant date measured over a period, as applicable. To earn the target number of market-based restricted stock units (which represents of the number of the market-based restricted stock units set forth in the table above), the Company must perform at the th percentile, with the maximum number of market-based restricted stock units earned if the Company performs at the th percentile. 
 Performance-based restricted stock units granted pursuant to the 2022 Management Agreement in fiscal year 2025 are eligible to vest on June 1, 2027, those granted in fiscal year 2024 are eligible to vest on June 1, 2026, and those granted in fiscal year 2023 are eligible to vest on June 1, 2025. The performance-based restricted stock units are tied to "RCS" (as defined in the relevant grant agreement) and are eligible to vest based on the Company's achievement of certain performance metrics (as defined in the relevant grant agreement) of "RCS" measured over a period. The target number of performance-based restricted stock units that may be earned pursuant to these grants is equal to of the grant amounts set forth in the above table (the numbers in the table represent the maximum number of performance-based restricted stock units that may be earned). At the end of each reporting period, we assess the probability of each performance metric and upon determination that certain thresholds are probable, we record expense for the unvested portion of the shares of performance-based restricted stock units. 
 The unvested portions of time-based, market-based and performance-based restricted stock units held by ZMC were and as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, restricted stock units previously granted to ZMC vested, and restricted stock units were forfeited by ZMC.

 We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, nor did we have any transfers into or out of Level 3 during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Nonrecurring fair value measurements 
 We hold equity investments in certain unconsolidated entities without a readily determinable fair value. These strategic investments represent less than a 20 ownership interest in each of the privately-held affiliates, and we do not maintain significant influence over or control of the entities. We have elected the practical expedient in Topic 321, Investments-Equity Securities , to measure these investments at cost less any impairment, adjusted for observable price changes, if any. Based on these considerations, we estimate that the carrying value of the acquired shares represents the fair value of the investment. At September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, we held and , respectively, of such investments in Other assets within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 The 2022 Credit Agreement also includes, among other terms and conditions, a maximum leverage ratio covenant, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, and dispose of all or substantially all assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions and baskets. In addition, the 2022 Credit Agreement provides for events of default customary for a credit facility of this size and type, including, among others, non-payment of principal and interest when due thereunder, breaches of representations and warranties, noncompliance with covenants, acts of insolvency, cross-defaults to material indebtedness, and material judgment defaults (subject to certain limitations and cure periods).

 Term Loan 
 On June 22, 2022, we entered into an unsecured -Day Term Loan Credit Agreement ("Term Loan"). The Term Loan provided for an unsecured -day term loan credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of , maturing on June 21, 2023. We fully drew down on the Term Loan on June 22, 2022 at approximately . The proceeds were used to finance a portion of the repurchase of the Convertible Notes (see below). A portion of the proceeds from the April 14, 2023 issuance of the 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes were used to fully repay the Term Loan on April 27, 2023. 
 Convertible Notes 
 In conjunction with the acquisition of Zynga on May 23, 2022, we entered into (a) the First Supplemental Indenture (the 2024 Supplemental Indenture to the Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2019 (the 2024 Indenture ), between Zynga and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association) (the Convertible Notes Trustee ), relating to Zynga s Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Convertible Notes ), and (b) the First Supplemental Indenture (the 2026 Supplemental Indenture and, together with the 2024 Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures to the Indenture, dated as of December 17, 2020 (the 2026 Indenture and, together with the 2024 Indenture, the Indentures ), between Zynga and the Convertible Notes Trustee, relating to Zynga s Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Convertible Notes and, together with the 2024 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes ). As of the closing date of the acquisition, approximately aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes was outstanding and approximately aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes was outstanding. 
 Following the acquisition and according to the Supplemental Indentures, we assumed all of Zynga s rights and obligations under the Indentures, and the Company guaranteed the payment and other obligations of Zynga under the Convertible Notes. As a result of our acquisition of Zynga, the right to convert each one thousand dollar principal amount of such Convertible Notes into shares of Zynga common stock was changed into a right to convert such principal amount of such Convertible Notes into the number of units of Reference Property equal to the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the closing, in each case pursuant to the terms and procedures set forth in the applicable Indenture. A unit of Reference Property is defined in each Indenture as shares of Take-Two common stock and in cash, without interest, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Take-Two common stock.

 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes and (b) aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes were tendered for cash. In addition, (a) aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes, and (b) 2026 Convertible Notes were surrendered for conversion into the applicable Reference Property. In total, we paid for the tendered or converted 2024 Convertible Notes, including interest, and for the tendered 2026 Convertible Notes in cash, and we issued shares of our common stock upon the conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes. After settlement of all Convertible Notes tendered or surrendered for conversion, aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Convertible Notes remained outstanding and aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Notes remained outstanding. 
 The 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes constitute senior unsecured indebtedness of Zynga, ranking pari passu with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations of Zynga. As a result, the 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes are structurally senior to the indebtedness of the Company as to Zynga, its subsidiaries, and their respective assets. As noted above, the Company also guaranteed the payment and other obligations of Zynga under the Convertible Notes. The Company's guarantees of the 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations. 
 Under the terms of the applicable Indentures, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2026 with respect to the 2026 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: 
 during any calendar quarter, if the value of a unit of Reference Property (based on the last reported sales price of our common stock), for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price of the applicable series of the 2026 Convertible Notes, on each applicable trading day 
 
 during the business-day period after any consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per one thousand dollar principal amount of each applicable series of the 2026 Convertible Notes for such trading day was less than of the product of the value of a unit of Reference Property (based on the last reported sale price of our common stock) and the conversion rate of the applicable series of the 2026 Convertible Notes, on each such trading day 
 
 if we call the 2026 Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the respective redemption date or 
 
 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the respective Indentures. 
 Upon any conversion, holders will receive either cash or a combination of cash and shares of Take-Two common stock, at our election. As of September 30, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes to convert their series of the Convertible Notes have not been met, and, therefore, they are not yet convertible. 
 We have elected to account for these Convertible Notes, which are considered derivatives, using the fair value option (Level 2) under ASC 825, as the Convertible Notes were initially recognized at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Zynga Acquisition and we do not expect significant fluctuations in fair value through maturity. We initially recorded as the acquisition date fair value for the 2024 Convertible Notes and for the 2026 Convertible Notes. The fair value was determined as the expected cash payment and value of shares to be issued to settle the Convertible Notes. 
 The 2024 Convertible Notes matured on June 1, 2024. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we paid for converted 2024 Convertible Notes, including interest, and we issued shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes.

 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with an average AFSI exceeding 1.0 billion over a consecutive three-year period. The CAMT is effective for taxable year ending March 31, 2024. It is possible that the CAMT could result in an additional tax liability over the regular federal corporate tax liability in a particular year based on differences between book and taxable income. We estimate no tax liability relating to CAMT for the current fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact the Inflation Reduction Act may have on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 of reported profits, referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries have already implemented or are taking steps to implement Pillar Two. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two slightly differently that the model rules and on different timelines. Many aspects of Pillar Two are effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. Pillar Two could result in additional tax liability over the regular corporate tax liability in a particular jurisdiction to the extent tax expense is less than 15 minimum rate. The impact of Pillar Two was not material to the tax provision for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. We will continue to evaluate the impact Pillar Two may have on our operations. 
 We are regularly examined by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Examinations may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. It is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations may have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods.

 Overview 
 Our Business 
 We are a leading developer, publisher, and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe. We develop, operate, and publish products principally through Rockstar Games, 2K, and Zynga. Our products are currently designed for console gaming systems, PC, and mobile, including smartphones and tablets. We deliver our products through physical retail, digital download, online platforms, and cloud streaming services. 
 Our strategy is to be the most creative, innovative, and efficient company in the evolving interactive entertainment industry. With our diverse portfolio that spans all key platforms and numerous genres, we strive to create the highest quality, most engaging interactive entertainment franchises that captivate our global audience. Most of our intellectual property is internally owned and developed, which we believe best positions us financially and competitively. We have established a portfolio of proprietary software content for the major hardware and mobile platforms in a wide range of genres, including action, adventure, family/casual, hyper-casual, role-playing, shooter, social casino, sports, and strategy, which we distribute worldwide. We believe that our player-first approach and commitment to creativity and innovation are distinguishing strengths, enabling us to differentiate our products in the marketplace by combining advanced technology with compelling storylines and characters that provide unique gameplay experiences. We have created, acquired, or licensed a group of highly-recognizable brands to match the broad consumer demographics that we serve, ranging from adults to children and game enthusiasts to casual gamers. Another cornerstone of our strategy is to support the success of our products in the marketplace through innovative marketing programs and global distribution on platforms and through channels that are relevant to our target audience. 
 We derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our interactive entertainment content, which includes the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by third parties, the sale of in-game virtual items and advertising, and live services on console, PC, and mobile. Operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to release new, commercially successful software products and to manage effectively their development and marketing costs. We have internal development studios located in Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, India, Serbia, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and the United States (U.S.).

Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games' strategy is to develop a limited number of titles that are known for their quality and longevity in the market for which they can create sequels and incremental revenue opportunities through virtual currency, add-on content, and in-game purchases. Software titles published by our Rockstar Games label are primarily internally developed. We expect Rockstar Games, our wholly-owned publisher of the Grand Theft Auto , LA Noire , Max Payne , Midnight Club , Red Dead Redemption , and other popular franchises, to continue to be a leader in the action/adventure product category and to create groundbreaking entertainment. We believe that Rockstar Games has established a uniquely original, popular, cultural phenomenon with its Grand Theft Auto series, which is the interactive entertainment industry's most iconic and critically acclaimed brand and has sold-in over 430 million units worldwide. Our most recent installment, Grand Theft Auto V , which was released in 2013, has sold-in over 205 million units worldwide and includes access to Grand Theft Auto Online . Rockstar Games offers its GTA+ membership program, which engages its player community with an array of rotating benefits, including access to classic Rockstar titles. Rockstar Games continues to invest in the franchise and plans to release Grand Theft Auto VI in the fall of calendar year 2025. The label released its first trailer for the title in December 2023 and will share more details over time. Red Dead Redemption 2 , which has been a critical and commercial success that set numerous entertainment industry records, has sold-in more than 65 million units worldwide to date. Rockstar Games continues to expand on its established series by developing sequels, offering downloadable episodes, and providing additional content. Rockstar Games' titles are published across all key platforms, including mobile. 
 2K. Our 2K label has published a variety of popular entertainment properties across all key platforms and across a range of genres including shooter, action, role-playing, strategy, sports, and family/casual entertainment. In recent years, 2K has expanded its offerings to include several new franchises that are expected to enhance and diversify its slate of games and provide opportunities for sequels and additional content. We expect 2K to continue to develop new, successful franchises in the future. 2K's internally owned and developed franchises include the critically acclaimed, multi-million unit selling BioShock , Mafia , Sid Meier's Civilization , and XCOM franchises, as well as the Borderlands and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands franchises, which are now owned by us following our June 2024 acquisition of Gearbox. 2K's realistic sports simulation titles include our flagship NBA 2K series, which continues to be the top-ranked NBA basketball video game, the WWE 2K professional wrestling series, PGA TOUR 2K , and TopSpin 2K . 2K also publishes mobile titles, including WWE SuperCard and NFL 2K Playmakers . In 2018, we expanded our relationship with the NBA through the NBA 2K League. 
 Private Division. Our Private Division label was dedicated to bringing titles from the industry's leading creative talent to market and was the publisher, developer, and owner of Kerbal Space Program and OlliOlli World . In October 2024, we sold the label, including our rights to substantially all of the label's titles. Take-Two will continue to support No Rest for the Wicked , which launched in early access on PC in April. 
 Zynga. Our Zynga label publishes popular free-to-play mobile games that deliver high quality, deeply engaging entertainment experiences and generates revenue from in-game sales and in-game advertising. Zynga's strategy is to have numerous games in concept development and to determine which titles are best suited for soft launch and worldwide launch based on the achievement of various milestones and KPI thresholds. Zynga's diverse portfolio of popular game franchises has been downloaded more than six billion times, including CSR Racing , Dragon City , Empires Puzzles , FarmVille , Game of Thrones: Legends, Golf Rival , Harry Potter: Puzzles Spells , Match Factory! , Merge Dragons! , Merge Magic! , Monster Legends , Star Wars: Hunters , Toon Blast , Top Eleven , Top Troops , Toy Blast , Two Dots , Words With Friends , Zynga Poker , and a high volume of hyper-casual mobile titles, including Fill the Fridge!, Parking Jam 3D , Power Slap , Pull the Pin, Screw Jam , Twisted Tangle, and Tangled Snakes . 
 International Expansion 
 The global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow, and we seek to increase our presence internationally, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. We are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in Asia, where our strategy is to build on our licensing relationships and also broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence, especially in China. 2K has secured a multi-year license from the NBA to develop an online version of our NBA simulation game in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Our first such title, NBA 2K Online , a free-to-play NBA simulation game based on the console edition of NBA 2K , which was co-developed by 2K and Tencent, is the top online PC sports game in China with over 65 million registered users. We have released two iterations of NBA 2K Online and continue to enhance the title with new features. While we retain title to all intellectual property, in some regions, local publishers, under license agreements, are responsible for localization of software content, distribution, and marketing of the products in their respective local markets. 
 Trends and Factors Affecting our Business 
 Product Release Schedule. Our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of our titles. Generally, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from a few popular franchises, particularly around new releases within those franchises, some of which have annual or biennial releases. 
 27 

Additionally, our Grand Theft Auto products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. Sales of Grand Theft Auto products generated 12.9 of our net revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The timing of our Grand Theft Auto product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis. 
 Economic Environment and Retailer Performance. We continue to monitor various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that may affect our business in several areas, including consumer demand, inflation, pricing pressure on our products, credit quality of our receivables, and foreign currency exchange rates. Actions we have taken to date and other potential actions we may take in the future in response to these factors could result in negative impacts in future periods. 
 The economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future. There has been increased consolidation in our industry, as larger, better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position to withstand prolonged periods of economic downturn and sustain their business through the financial volatility. Also, bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business, due to uncollectible accounts receivable and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers. 
 Hardware Platforms. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by third parties. Such console revenue comprised 37.2 of our net revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The success of our business is dependent upon consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms. When new hardware platforms are introduced, demand for interactive entertainment developed for older platforms typically declines, which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles. The latest Sony and Microsoft consoles provide "backwards compatibility" (i.e., the ability to play games for the previous generation of consoles). The inclusion of such features on new consoles could mitigate the risk of such a decline. However, we cannot be certain how backwards compatibility will affect demand for our products. Further, events beyond our control may impact the availability of these new consoles, which may also affect demand. We manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development. Accordingly, our strategy for these platforms is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles. 
 Online Content and Digital Distribution. We provide a variety of online delivered products, including direct digital downloads of our titles, and access to additional offerings through virtual currency, add-on content, and in-game purchases, which drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles. Net revenue from digital online channels comprised 96.4 of our net revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024. We expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to be the primary part of our business over the long term. 
 A significant portion of our mobile titles are distributed, marketed, and promoted through third parties, primarily Apple s App Store and the Google Play Store. Virtual items for our mobile games are purchased through the payment processing systems of these platform providers. We generate a significant portion of our net revenue through the Apple and Google platforms and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Apple and Google generally have the discretion to set the amounts of their platform fees and change their platforms terms of service and other policies with respect to us or other developers at their sole discretion, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. These platform fees are recorded as cost of revenue as incurred. Further, as a result of the platform fees associated with online game sales, our mobile net revenue generally generates a lower gross margin percentage than our Console or PC revenue. Accordingly, the overall product mix between mobile and other game sales may affect our gross margin percentage. We are also expanding our direct-to-consumer efforts more meaningfully across our mobile portfolio to enhance profitability. 
 In addition, we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency, add-on content, in-game purchases, and in-game advertising, all of which are typically delivered digitally. 
 Player acquisition costs. Principally for our mobile titles, we use advertising and other forms of player acquisition and retention to grow and retain our player audience. These expenditures, which are recorded within Sales and marketing in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, generally relate to the promotion of new game launches and ongoing performance-based programs to drive new player acquisition and lapsed player reactivation. Over time, the effectiveness or cost of these acquisition and retention-related programs may change, affecting our operating results.

 We monitor Net Bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business. Net Bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically during the period and includes licensing fees, merchandise, in-game advertising, strategy guides, and publisher incentives. Net Bookings were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase/ (decrease) Increase/ (decrease) 2024 2023 Increase/ (decrease) Increase/ (decrease) Net Bookings 1,474.9 1,444.9 30.0 2.1 2,693.1 2,646.5 46.6 1.8 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Net Bookings increased as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Net Bookings from Match Factory! , which released in November 2023, and Toon Blast. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Net Bookings from our Grand Theft Auto franchise, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, our Red Dead Redemption franchise, which included our August 2023 release of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare, and Empires Puzzles . 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, Net Bookings increased as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Net Bookings from Match Factory! , Toon Blast , and TopSpin 2K25 , which released in April 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Net Bookings from our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, our NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto franchises, and Empires Puzzles .

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue increased by 53.9 as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of 73.6 from Match Factory!, which released in November 2023, 
 30 

and 35.6 from Toon Blast. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue of (i) 27.4 from our Grand Theft Auto franchise, (ii) 21.8 from our NBA 2K franchise, and (iii) 13.1 from our Red Dead Redemption franchise, which included our August 2023 release of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare . 
 Net revenue from mobile increased by 94.0 and accounted for 54.7 of our total net revenue for three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 49.7 for the prior year period.

Net revenue from PC and other increased by 15.5 and accounted for 9.0 of our total net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.2 for the prior year period. The increase in net revenue from PC and other was primarily due to an increase in net revenue from our Risk of Rain franchise , which was acquired in connection with our acquisition of Gearbox in June 2024 (refer to Note 13 - Acquisitions ), and our Borderlands, Grand Theft Auto, and NBA 2K franchises. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from our Red Dead Redemption franchise. 
 Recurrent consumer spending ("RCS") is generated from ongoing consumer engagement and includes revenue from virtual currency, add-on content, in-game purchases, and in-game advertising. Net revenue from RCS increased by 78.6 and accounted for 79.7 of net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 77.0 of net revenue for the prior year period. The increase in net revenue from RCS was primarily due to increases in net revenue from Match Factory! and Toon Blast . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from our Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K franchises . Net revenue from full game and other decreased by 24.7 and accounted for 20.3 of net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 23.0 of net revenue for the prior year period. The decrease in net revenue from full game and other was due primarily to a decrease in net revenue from our Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K, and Red Dead Redemption franchises. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net revenue in our Borderlands and Mafia franchises. 
 Net revenue from digital online channels increased by 60.3 and accounted for 96.1 of our total net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 95.4 for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to increases in net revenue from Match Factory! and Toon Blast. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue in our Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K franchises. Net revenue from physical retail and other channels decreased by 6.4 and accounted for 3.9 of our total net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.6 for the same period in the prior year period. The decrease in net revenue from physical retail and other channels was due primarily to a decrease in net revenue from our NBA 2K and WWE 2K franchises. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net revenue from physical retail and other channels from our Red Dead Redemption franchise. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 53.8 as compared to 32.0 for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to (i) lower amortization of intangibles assets due primarily to impairment charges in the prior year for acquisition-related intangible assets and (ii) lower internal royalties due to the timing of when royalties are earned, partially offset by higher digital platform fees. 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net revenue by 0.5 and increased gross profit by 0.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period.

 Selling and marketing 
 Selling and marketing expenses increased by 126.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to higher overall marketing expenses for Match Factory!, with no corresponding expense in the prior fiscal year , Game of Thrones: Legends, and our NBA 2K franchise . 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 74.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to increases in (i) legal fees and contingencies related to the IBM case against Zynga and (ii) personnel expense due to increased headcount.

 Research and development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 14.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increases in personnel expense due to increased headcount and IT-related expenses for cloud-based services and IT infrastructure, partially offset by additional R D related credits related to certain titles. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 2.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to increases in leasehold improvements for office buildouts and IT infrastructure. 
 Goodwill impairment 
 Goodwill impairment expenses decreased by 165.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due to a partial impairment recognized related to one of our reporting units in the prior year (refer to Note 14 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net ). 
 Business reorganization 
 Business reorganization increased by 13.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to the cancellation of titles and employee-related costs as part of our cost reduction program (refer to Note 15 - Business Reorganization ). 
 Interest and other, net 
 Interest and other, net was expense of 25.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to expense of 31.1 for the prior year period. The net decrease in expense was due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily due 
 32 

to increases in interest rates and a decrease in foreign currency losses. These decreases in expense were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our debt transactions (refer to Note 9 - D ebt ). 
 Loss on fair value adjustments, net 
 Loss on fair value adjustments, net was a loss of 1.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a loss of 2.2 for the prior year period. The change was due primarily to changes in fair value based on the observable price changes of our long-term investments. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is based on our projected annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025, adjusted for specific items that are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. The provision for income taxes was 41.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the benefit from income taxes of 33.4 for the prior year period. 
 When compared to the statutory rate of 21 , the effective tax rate of (12.7) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to tax expense of 104.9 related to an increase in valuation allowance and tax expense of 9.9 related to geographic mix of earnings offset by benefits of 17.2 from tax credits. 
 In the prior year period, when compared to the statutory rate of 21.0 , the effective tax rate of 5.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to tax expense of 56.3 related to an increase in the U.S. valuation allowance, tax expense of 33.5 related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill, 8.1 related to the revaluation of deferred taxes due to a change in the statutory tax rate in Turkey, offset by tax benefits of 21.6 from tax credits and by the geographic mix of earnings. 
 The change in the effective tax rate, when compared to the prior year period's effective tax rate, is due primarily to decreased tax expense related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill, decreased tax expense related to the revaluation of deferred taxes due to statutory rate changes in the prior period, offset by increased tax expense from changes in valuation allowance, increased tax expense related to geographic mix of earnings, and decreased tax benefits from tax credits. 
 The accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depends on the stock price at the time of the employee award vesting. 
 We anticipate that additional excess tax benefits or shortfalls from employee stock compensation, tax credits, and changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in the future. In addition, we are regularly examined by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Examinations may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. It is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations could have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods. 
 The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARPA ), among other things, includes provisions to expand the IRC Section 162(m) disallowance for deduction of certain compensation paid by publicly held corporations. Effective for tax years starting after December 31, 2026 (April 1, 2027 for the Company), the ARPA expands the limitation to cover the next five most highly compensated employees. The ARPA did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to evaluate the potential impact the ARPA may have on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with an average AFSI exceeding 1.0 billion over a consecutive three-year period. The CAMT is effective for taxable year ending March 31, 2024. It is possible that the CAMT could result in an additional tax liability over the regular federal corporate tax liability in a particular year based on differences between book and taxable income. We estimate no tax liability relating to CAMT for the current fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact the Inflation Reduction Act may have on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 of reported profits, referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries have already implemented or are taking steps to implement Pillar Two. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two slightly differently that the model rules and on different timelines. Many aspects of Pillar Two are effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. Pillar Two could result in additional tax liability over the regular corporate tax liability in a particular jurisdiction to the extent tax expense is less than 15 minimum rate. The impact of Pillar Two was not material to the tax 
 33 

provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We will continue to evaluate the impact Pillar Two may have on our operations. 
 Net loss and Loss per share 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 365.5, as compared to a net loss of 543.6 in the prior year period. Basic and diluted loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.08, as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of 3.20 in the prior year period. Basic weighted average shares of 175.4 were 5.5 shares higher as compared to the prior year period basic weighted average shares, due primarily to normal stock compensation activity. See Note 10 - Loss Per Share to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

These decreases in expense were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our debt transactions (refer to Note 9 - Debt and a gain on debt extinguishment recognized in the prior year on the partial repayment of our 2024 Notes. 
 Loss on fair value adjustments, net 
 Loss on fair value adjustments, net was 4.3 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.4 for the prior year period. The change was due primarily to changes in fair value based on the observable price changes of our long-term investments. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes for the six months ended September 30, 2024 is based on our projected annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025, adjusted for specific items that are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. The provision for income taxes was 91.0 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the benefit from income taxes of 56.3 for the prior year period. 
 When compared to the statutory rate of 21 , the effective tax rate of (17.0) for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to tax expense of 201.8 related to an increase in the U.S. valuation allowance, tax expense of 18.1 related to geographic mix of earnings offset by benefits of 35.0 from tax credits. 
 In the prior year period, when compared to the statutory rate of 21.0 , the effective tax rate of 7.0 for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was due primarily to tax expense of 81.6 related to an increase in the U.S. valuation allowance, tax expense of 33.5 related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill, 8.1 related to the revaluation of deferred taxes due to a change in the statutory tax rate in Turkey, offset by tax benefits of 42.0 from tax credits and by the geographic mix of earnings. 
 The change in the effective tax rate, when compared to the prior year period's effective tax rate, is due primarily to decreased tax expense related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill, decreased tax expense related to the revaluation of deferred taxes due to statutory rate changes in the prior period and decreased tax expense from employee stock-based compensation, offset by increased tax expense from changes in valuation allowance, increased tax expense related to geographic mix of earnings, and decreased tax benefits from tax credits. 
 The accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depends on the stock price at the time of the employee award vesting. 
 We anticipate that additional excess tax benefits or shortfalls from employee stock compensation, tax credits, and changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in the future. In addition, we are regularly examined by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Examinations may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. It is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations could have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods. 
 The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the ARPA ), among other things, includes provisions to expand the IRC Section 162(m) disallowance for deduction of certain compensation paid by publicly held corporations. Effective for tax years starting after December 31, 2026 (April 1, 2027 for the Company), the ARPA expands the limitation to cover the next five most highly compensated employees. The ARPA did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial 
 36 

Statements for the six months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to evaluate the potential impact the ARPA may have on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with an average AFSI exceeding 1.0 billion over a consecutive three-year period. The CAMT is effective for taxable year ending March 31, 2024. It is possible that the CAMT could result in an additional tax liability over the regular federal corporate tax liability in a particular year based on differences between book and taxable income. We estimate no tax liability relating to CAMT for the current fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact the Inflation Reduction Act may have on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 of reported profits, referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries have already implemented or are taking steps to implement Pillar Two. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two slightly differently that the model rules and on different timelines. Many aspects of Pillar Two are effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. Pillar Two could result in additional tax liability over the regular corporate tax liability in a particular jurisdiction to the extent tax expense is less than 15 minimum rate. The impact of Pillar Two was not material to the tax provision for the six months ended September 30, 2024. We will continue to evaluate the impact Pillar Two may have on our operations. 
 Net loss and loss per share 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 627.5, as compared to net loss of 749.6 in the prior year period. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, basic and diluted loss per share was 3.61 as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of 4.42 in the prior year period. Basic weighted average shares of 173.8 were 4.2 shares higher as compared to the prior year period basic weighted average shares, due primarily to normal stock compensation activity, including vests as well as grants and forfeitures in the prior year being fully outstanding in the current year, as well as stock issued as consideration for the acquisition of Gearbox. See Note 10 - Loss Per Share to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary cash requirements are to fund (i) the development, manufacturing and marketing of our published products, (ii) working capital, (iii) capital expenditures, (iv) debt and interest payments, (v) tax payments, and (vi) acquisitions. We expect to rely on cash and cash equivalents as well as on short-term investments, funds provided by our operating activities, and our 2022 Credit Agreement to satisfy our working capital needs. Refer to Note 9 - Debt for additional discussion of our outstanding debt obligations. 
 Short-term investments 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.5 of short-term investments, which primarily consisted of bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days. From time to time, we may make additional short-term investments depending on future market conditions and liquidity needs. 
 Senior Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,650.0 of Senior Notes outstanding. 
 Credit Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement, and we had approximately 747.7 available for additional borrowings. 
 Convertible Notes 
 The 2026 Convertible Notes mature on December 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased in accordance with their terms, prior to the maturity date. The 2026 Convertible Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount does not accrete. An aggregate principal amount of 29.4 of the 2026 Convertible Notes remained outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 37 

Financial Condition 
 We are subject to credit risks, particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets. If we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position. 
 Generally, we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business. We do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers. We have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk. 
 A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers, including digital storefronts and platform partners, and distributors. Our five largest customers accounted for 82.2 and 79.5 of net revenue during the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, five customers accounted for 77.4 and 69.9 of our gross accounts receivable, respectively. Customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 67.2 and 57.7 of such balances at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. We had three customers who accounted for 33.9 , 17.8 , and 15.5 of our gross accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024, and three customers who accounted for 21.8 , 18.1 , and 16.9 of our gross accounts receivable as of March 31, 2024. We did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024. Based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations, maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers who sell our physical products, and our past collection experience, we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk, although we actively monitor each customer's creditworthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers' business and access to capital. We are monitoring the current global economic conditions, including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable. 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and projected cash flow from operations, along with availability under our 2022 Credit Agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, and commitments on both a short-term and long-term basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was 664.3. These balances are dispersed across various locations around the world. We believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates. In addition, we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 21.7 shares of our common stock. Under this program, we may purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. Repurchases are subject to the availability of stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the stock, our financial performance and other conditions. The program does not require us to repurchase shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, as part of the program. We have repurchased a total of 11.7 shares of our common stock under the program, and as of September 30, 2024, 10.0 shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program. 
 Our changes in cash flows were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (millions of dollars) 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (319.4) 69.8 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (68.0) 60.3 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 597.0 (71.1) Effects of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents 8.0 (7.4) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents 217.6 51.6 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 1,319.6 of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents, compared to 1,102.0 at March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to Net cash provided by financing activities, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of our 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes (refer to Note 9 - Debt ). This increase was partially offset by the decrease in (i) Net cash used in operating activities, which was due primarily to investments in software 
 38 

development and licenses, partially offset by sales of our products and (ii) Net cash used in investing activities which was due primarily to the purchase of fixed assets and our immaterial investments. 
 Commitments 
 Refer to Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies for disclosures regarding our commitments. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 In fiscal year 2025, we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately 150.0. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, capital expenditures were 71.9. 
 International Operations 
 Net revenue earned outside of the United States is principally generated by our operations in Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada, and Latin America. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 39.8 and 38.8 , respectively, of our net revenue was earned outside the United States. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results. 
 Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results and Seasonality 
 We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles, variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms, market acceptance of our titles, development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles, sequels or enhancements of existing titles, projected and actual changes in platforms, the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors, product returns, changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors, the accuracy of retailers' forecasts of consumer demand, the size and timing of acquisitions, the timing of orders from major customers, and order cancellations and delays in product shipment. Sales of our full game products are also seasonal, with peak demand typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter during the holiday season. For certain of our software products with multiple performance obligations, we defer the recognition of our net revenue over an estimated service period which generally ranges from six to fifteen months. As a result, the quarter in which we generate the highest Net Bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of Net revenue. Quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 We seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a short-term investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities of less than two years. Since short-term investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term maturities. However, the fair value of a short-term portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. We do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our short-term investment portfolio. Our investments are held for purposes other than trading. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.5 of short-term investments, which included 0.0 of available-for-sale securities. The available-for-sale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, in Stockholders' equity. We also had 876.1 of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market funds and bank-time deposits. We determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio, there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or liquidity as of September 30, 2024. 
 Historically, fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results. 
 Under our 2022 Credit Agreement, loans will bear interest at a rate of (a) 0.000 to 0.625 above an alternate base rate (8.00 at September 30, 2024) or (b) 1.000 to 1.625 above SOFR, approximately 4.84 at September 30, 2024, which rates are determined by the Company's credit rating. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under our 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 39 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In particular, during the six months ended September 30, 2023, there was a significant devaluation of the Turkish Lira against the U.S. Dollar, which negatively affected our results. It is possible that further devaluations could occur, which would have a negative impact on our results. Accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of Stockholders' equity on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of 71.6 and a loss of 63.1, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss of 3.4 and a loss of 5.5, respectively, included in Interest and other, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of 66.2 and a loss of 37.1, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss of 6.2 and a loss of 19.3, respectively, included in Interest and other, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Balance Sheet Hedging Activities 
 We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with non-functional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans, non-functional currency denominated accounts receivable and non-functional currency denominated accounts payable. These transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in Interest and other, net, in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 332.6 of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars and 156.9 of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, all of which have maturities of less than one year. At March 31, 2024, we had 243.0 of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars and 72.2 of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, all of which had maturities of less than one year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a loss of 3.3 and a gain of 3.6, respectively, related to foreign currency forward contracts in Interest and other, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a gain of 0.2 and a gain of 7.4, respectively, related to foreign currency forward contracts in Interest and other, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts were immaterial and were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. 
 Our hedging programs are designed to reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of currency exchange rate movements. We believe that the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 39.8 of our revenue was generated outside the United States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 4.0 , while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 4.0 . In our opinion, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of revenue and operating expenses incurred in local currency. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act") were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 40 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 On June 11, 2024, we acquired Gearbox. Our management plans to exclude Gearbox from its assessment of and report on internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. We are currently in the process of incorporating the internal controls and procedures for Gearbox into our internal control over financial reporting for purposes of our assessment of and report on internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events.
