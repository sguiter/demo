FORWARD-LOO KING STATEMENTS 
 The section titled " Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations " as well as other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain "forward-looking statements" for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future, including those relating to the future financial performance and business strategies and expectations for our business. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words "anticipate," "believe," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intends," "may," "might," "plan," "possible," "potential," "predict," "project," "should," "will," "would" and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, client demand, business strategies, technology developments, financing and investment plans, competitive position, our industry and regulatory environment, potential growth opportunities and the effects of competition. 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include: 
 our revenues, the concentration of our customers and the ability to retain our current customers; 

our ability to negotiate with our customers on favorable terms; 

our ability to maintain and grow our brand and reputation cost-effectively; 

the execution of our growth strategy; 

the impact of public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics on our business and results of operations; 

our projected financial information, growth rate and market opportunity; 

the health of our industry, claim volumes, and market conditions; 

changes in the insurance and automotive collision industries, including the adoption of new technologies; 

global economic conditions and geopolitical events; 

competition in our market and our ability to retain and grow market share; 

our ability to develop, introduce and market new enhanced versions of our solutions; 

our sales and implementation cycles; 

the ability of our research and development efforts to create significant new revenue streams; 

changes in applicable laws or regulations; 

changes in international economic, political, social and governmental conditions and policies, including corruption risks in China and other countries; 

our reliance on third-party data, technology and intellectual property; 

changes in our customers' or the public's perceptions regarding the use of artificial intelligence ("AI"); 

our ability to protect our intellectual property; 

our ability to keep our data and information systems secure from data security breaches; 

our ability to acquire or invest in companies or pursue business partnerships; 

our ability to raise financing in the future and improve our capital structure; 

our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors; 

our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

our ability to expand or maintain our existing customer base; and 

our ability to service our indebtedness. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are 
 3 

beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described above and under the heading "Risk Factors." Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Total revenues 

Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. As of September 30, 2024 , approximately million of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations in the amount of approximately million during the following twelve months, and approximately million thereafter. The estimated revenues do not include unexercised contract renewals. The remaining performance obligations exclude future transaction revenue where revenue is recognized as the services are rendered and in the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice. Deferred Revenue Revenue recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from amounts in deferred revenue as of June 30, 2024 was million. Revenue recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from amounts in deferred revenue as of June 30, 2023 was million . Revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from amounts in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was million.

Private Warrants were outstanding (see Note 17). As of December 31, 2023, the Company's Private Warrants were recognized as liabilities and measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Private Warrants were valued using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs within the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions utilized under the Black-Scholes option pricing model require judgments and estimates. Changes in these inputs and assumptions could affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of the Private Warrants. Accordingly, the Private Warrants were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Expected volatility 

Expected dividend yield 

Risk-free interest rate 

The estimated fair value of each Private Warrant using the Company's stock price on the valuation date and above assumptions was as of December 31, 2023. Contingent Consideration Liability The contingent consideration liability relates to the Company's acquisition of Safekeep, Inc. in February 2022. The contingent consideration liability is adjusted each reporting period for changes in fair value, which can result from changes in anticipated payments and changes in assumed discount rates. These inputs are unobservable in the market and therefore categorized as Level 3 inputs. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using probability-weighted discounted cash flows and a Monte Carlo simulation model. The discount rate, based on the Company's estimated cost of debt, was . As of December 31, 2023 , the contingent consideration liability had a fair value of million. As of September 30, 2024 , there were no significant changes to the inputs used within the Monte Carlo simulation model and the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability was million. The Company did t recognize any change in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The contingent consideration liability is recognized within accrued expenses and other liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest Rate Cap In August 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements to reduce its exposure to increases in interest rates applicable to its floating rate long-term debt (see Note 13). The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements was estimated using inputs that were observable or that could be corroborated by observable market data and therefore was classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company did not designate its interest rate cap agreements as hedging instruments and records the changes in fair value within other (expense) income net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the interest rate cap agreements had a fair value of million and million, respectively. The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements is classified within other current assets and other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

t recognize any impairment charges related to these assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets (see Note 10). Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The fair value of the Company s long-term debt, including current maturities, was estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments and fluctuates with changes in applicable interest rates among other factors. The fair value of long-term debt is classified as a Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy and is established based on observable inputs in less active markets. 

 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the Company's pre-tax book income. The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax treatment of the loss on the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities. The Company recognized an income tax provision of million and an income tax benefit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the Company's pre-tax book income. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense, the tax benefit recognized related to the impairment of certain intangible assets and the tax benefit related to a return to provision adjustment related to estimated research and development credits. The Company made income tax payments of million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company received negligible refunds from various states during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company made income tax payments of million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company received negligible refunds from various states during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized tax benefits were materially consistent with the amount as of December 31, 2023 . The Company believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will not significantly change over the following twelve months.

 impairments to goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets were recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In May 2023, the Company's China reporting unit experienced adverse impacts as a result of changes in market conditions and increases in interest rates which contributed to reduced forecasted revenues and reduced projected future cash flows. As a result of these adverse impacts, the Company performed an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of its China reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. When performing the assessment, the Company determined the fair value of its China reporting unit based on forecasted future cash flows. Based on the Company's forecast of the future cash flows of its China reporting unit, it was determined the carrying value of goodwill for its China reporting unit was impaired and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million. When performing the quantitative impairment assessment, the Company used a quantitative approach to measure the fair value of its China reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach, which is a Level 3 measurement. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgments, including estimates of future cash flows, which are dependent on internal forecasts and determination of the Company s weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The weighted average cost of capital used for the China reporting unit in the Company s analysis was . As of November 30, 2023, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its remaining reporting unit with goodwill and its trademark indefinite life intangible assets. The Company determined there were no indicators of impairment and that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and trademarks were greater than their carrying values and therefore performing the next step of the impairment test was unnecessary.

 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Shares") at per share to the Investor for net proceeds of million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on an as-converted basis, the Preferred Shares represent an aggregate ownership interest of the issued and outstanding capital stock of CCC Cayman, or on a fully-diluted basis. The Preferred Shares are redeemable upon an actual or deemed redemption event as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement or at the option of the Investor beginning on the five-year anniversary of the Close Date, if an actual or deemed redemption event has not yet occurred. The redemption price, as defined by the Stock Purchase Agreement, is equal to the original issue price of the Preferred Shares, plus compound interest per annum on the Preferred Share issue price, plus any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Shares. The Preferred Shares do not participate in net income or losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Investor s ownership in CCC Cayman is classified in mezzanine equity as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in the control of the Company. In May 2023, the Company determined it was probable the non-controlling interest would become redeemable and began to accrete the non-controlling interest to its redemption value. Changes in the carrying value of the non-controlling interest are recorded as adjustments to additional paid-in capital.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements included herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" as set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to "CCC," the "Company," "we," "us," "our" and other similar terms refer to CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Business Overview 
 Founded in 1980, CCC is a leading SaaS platform for the multi-trillion-dollar P C insurance economy powering operations for insurers, repairers, automakers, part suppliers, lenders and more. CCC cloud technology connects more than 35,000 businesses digitizing mission-critical workflows, commerce and customer experiences. A trusted leader in AI, Internet of Things ("IoT"), customer experience, network and workflow management, CCC delivers innovations that keep people's lives moving forward when it matters most. 
 Our business has been built upon two foundational pillars: automotive insurance claims and automotive collision repair. For decades we have delivered leading software solutions to both the insurance and repair industries, including pioneering Direct Repair Programs ("DRP") in the U.S. beginning in 1992. DRP connects auto insurers and collision repair shops to create business value for both parties, and requires digital tools to facilitate interactions and manage partner programs. Insurer-to-shop DRP connections have created a strong network effect for CCC s platform, as insurers and repairers both benefit by joining the largest network to maximize opportunities. This has led to a virtuous cycle in which more insurers on the platform drives more value for the collision shops on the platform, and vice versa. 
 We believe we have become a leading insurance and repair SaaS provider in the U.S. by increasing the depth and breadth of our SaaS offerings over many years. Our insurance solutions help insurance carriers manage mission-critical workflows across the claims lifecycle, while building smart, dynamic experiences for their own customers. Our software integrates seamlessly with both legacy and modern systems alike and enables insurers to rapidly innovate on our platform. Our repair solutions help collision repair facilities achieve better performance throughout the collision repair cycle by digitizing processes to drive business growth, streamline operations and improve repair quality. We have more than 300 insurers on our network, connecting with more than 30,000 repair facilities through our multi-tenant cloud platform. We believe our software is the architectural backbone of insurance DRP systems and is a primary driver of material revenue for our collision shop customers and a source of material efficiencies for our insurance carrier customers. 
 Our platform is designed to solve the "many-to-many" problem faced by the insurance economy. There are numerous internally and externally developed insurance software solutions in the market today, with the vast majority of applications focused on insurance-only use cases and not on serving the broader insurance ecosystem. We have prioritized building a leading network around our automotive insurance and collision repair pillars to further digitize interactions and maximize value for our customers. We have tens of thousands of companies on our platform that participate in the insurance economy, including insurers, repairers, parts suppliers, automotive manufacturers, and financial institutions. Our solutions create value for each of these parties by enabling them to connect to our vast network to collaborate with other companies, streamline operations, and reduce processing costs and dollars lost through claims management inefficiencies, or claims leakage. Expanding our platform has added new layers of network effects, further accelerating the adoption of our software solutions. 
 We have processed more than 1 trillion of historical data across our network, allowing us to build proprietary data assets that leverage insurance claims, vehicle repair, automotive parts and other vehicle-specific information. We believe we are uniquely positioned to provide data-driven insights, analytics and AI-enhanced workflows that strengthen our solutions and improve business outcomes for our customers. Our AI solutions increase automation across existing insurance and repair processes including vehicle damage detection, claim triage, claim handling, repair estimating, intelligent claim review and claim subrogation. We deliver real-world AI with more than 100 U.S. auto insurers and more than 11,000 U.S. collision repairers actively using AI-powered solutions in production environments. 
 One of the primary obstacles facing the P C insurance economy is increasing complexity. Complexity in the P C insurance economy is driven by technological advancements, IoT data, new business models, supply chain disruption and changing consumer expectations. We believe digitization plays a critical role in managing this growing complexity while meeting consumer expectations. Our technology investments are focused on digitizing complex processes and interactions across our ecosystem, and we believe we are well positioned to power the P C insurance economy of the future with our data, network and platform. 
 26 

While our position in the P C insurance economy is grounded in the automotive insurance sector, the largest insurance sector in the U.S. representing nearly half of direct written premiums ("DWP"), we believe our integrations and cloud platform are capable of driving innovation across the entire P C insurance economy. Our customers are increasingly looking for CCC to expand its solutions to other parts of their business where they can benefit from our technology, service and partnership. In response, we are investing in new solutions that we believe will enable us to digitize the entire automotive claims lifecycle, and over time expand into adjacencies including other insurance lines. 
 We have strong customer relationships in the end-markets we serve, and these relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term nature of our contracts and the interconnectedness of our network. We have customer agreements with more than 300 insurers (including carriers, self-insurers and other entities processing insurance claims), including 27 of the top 30 automotive insurance carriers in the U.S., based on DWP, and hundreds of regional carriers. We have more than 35,000 total customers, including more than 30,000 automotive collision repair facilities (including repairers and other entities that estimate damaged vehicles), more than 5,500 parts suppliers, 13 of the top 15 automotive manufacturers based on new vehicle sales, and numerous other companies that participate in the P C insurance economy. 
 Key Performance Measures and Operating Metrics 
 In addition to our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, we rely on Software Net Dollar Retention Rate ("Software NDR") and Software Gross Dollar Retention Rate ("Software GDR") to measure and evaluate our business to make strategic decisions. Software NDR and Software GDR may not be comparable to or calculated in the same way as other similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 Software NDR 
 We believe that Software NDR provides our management and our investors with insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our existing customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. We also believe the results shown by this metric reflect the stability of our revenue base, which is one of our core competitive strengths. We calculate Software NDR by dividing (a) annualized software revenue recorded in the last month of the measurement period, for example, March for a quarter ending March 31, for unique billing accounts that generated revenue during the corresponding month of the prior year by (b) annualized software revenue as of the corresponding month of the prior year. The calculation includes changes for these billing accounts, such as changes in the solutions purchased, changes in pricing and transaction volume, but does not reflect revenue for new customers added. The calculation excludes: (a) changes in estimates related to the timing of one-time revenue and other revenue, including professional services, and (b) annualized software revenue for smaller customers with annualized software revenue below the threshold of 100,000 for carriers and 4,000 for shops. The customers that do not meet the revenue threshold are small carriers and shops that tend to have different buying behaviors, with a narrower solution focus, and different tenure compared to our core customers (excluded small carriers and shops represent less than 5 of total revenue within these sales channels). Our Software NDR includes carriers and shops who subscribe to our auto physical damage solutions, which account for most of the Company s revenue, and excludes revenue from smaller emerging solutions with international subsidiaries or other ecosystem solutions, such as parts suppliers and other automotive manufacturers, and also excludes CCC casualty solutions which are largely usage and professional service based.

Software GDR 
 We believe that Software GDR provides our management and our investors with insight into the value our solutions provide to our customers as represented by our ability to retain our existing customer base. We believe the results shown by this metric reflect the strength and stability of our revenue base, which is one of our core competitive strengths. We calculate Software GDR by dividing (a) annualized software revenue recorded in the last month of the measurement period in the prior year, reduced by annualized software revenue for unique billing accounts that are no longer customers as of the current period end by (b) annualized software revenue as of the corresponding month of the prior year. The calculation reflects only customer losses and does not reflect customer expansion or contraction for these billing accounts and does not reflect revenue for new customer billing accounts added. Our Software GDR calculation represents our annualized software revenue that is retained from the prior year and demonstrates that the vast majority of our customers continue to use our solutions and renew their subscriptions. The calculation excludes: (a) changes in estimates related to the timing of one-time revenue and other revenue, including professional services, and (b) annualized software revenue for smaller customers with annualized software revenue below the threshold of 100,000 for carriers and 4,000 for shops. 
 27 

The customers that do not meet the revenue threshold are small carriers and shops that tend to have different buying behaviors, with a narrower solution focus, and different tenure compared to our core customers (excluded small carriers and shops which represent less than 5 of total revenue within these sales channels). Our Software GDR includes carriers and shops who subscribe to our auto physical damage solutions, which account for most of the Company s revenue, and excludes revenue from smaller emerging solutions with international subsidiaries or other ecosystem solutions, such as parts suppliers and other automotive manufacturers, and excludes CCC casualty solutions which are largely usage and professional service based.

Revenues 
 Revenues increased by 17.3 million to 238.5 million, or 7.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's software subscription revenues accounted for 229.4 million and 212.5 million, or 96 of total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 29 

The increase in revenue was primarily a result of 5 growth from existing customer upgrades and expanding solution offerings to these existing customers as well as 3 growth from new customers. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues decreased by 3.0 million to 55.1 million, or 5.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of Revenues, exclusive of amortization of acquired technologies 
 Cost of revenues, exclusive of amortization of acquired technologies, increased by 3.4 million to 54.9 million, or 6.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 1.4 million increase in information technology ("IT") related costs, a 1.2 million increase in third party fees and direct costs associated with our revenue growth, and a 1.0 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation. 
 Amortization of Acquired Technologies 
 Amortization of acquired technologies decreased 6.4 million to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to certain acquired technology intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life in April 2024. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit increased by 20.3 million to 183.4 million, or 12.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross profit margin was 76.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 73.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was due to increased software subscription revenues, economies of scale resulting from fixed cost arrangements, and lower amortization of acquired technologies. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense increased by 6.0 million to 49.5 million, or 13.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 5.8 million increase in stock-based compensation and a 2.4 million increase in IT related costs, partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease in personnel and resource costs. 
 Selling and Marketing 
 Selling and marketing expense decreased by 1.3 million to 34.3 million, or 3.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 2.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation and a 0.6 million decrease in marketing and event costs, partially offset by a 2.2 million increase in personnel-related costs. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense increased by 3.4 million to 52.9 million, or 7.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 2.7 million increase in professional service costs and a 0.9 million increase in IT related costs. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets was 17.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 1.7 million to 16.4 million, or 11.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher variable interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income decreased by 1.8 million to 3.3 million, or 35.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower average balances on interest earning deposits and money market funds during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 Due to the redemption of all outstanding warrants in May 2024, the Company did not recognize any income or expense as a change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized an expense of 26.2 
 30 

million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities was primarily due to changes in the price of the Company's common stock during the reporting period. 
 Other Expense Net 
 We recognized other expense net of 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap derivative instruments during each period, driven by changes in the forward yield curves and time to maturity, and the income recognized from the interest rate cap derivative instruments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 The Company recognized an income tax provision of 8.9 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax provision during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the Company's pre-tax book income. The income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax treatment of the loss on the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and Free Cash Flow, which are each non-GAAP measures, are useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning, budgeting and forecasting purposes and setting management bonus programs. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance and comparing our performance with competitors and other comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate these measures in the same fashion. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit 
 We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit, as defined below, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as gross profit, adjusted for amortization of acquired technologies, impairment of acquired technologies, and stock-based compensation and related employer payroll tax, which are not indicative of our recurring core business operating results. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by Revenue.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share 
 We believe that Adjusted Net Income, as defined below, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful in evaluating our operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain expenses and non-operational expenses. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for the after-tax effects of amortization of intangible assets and acquired technologies, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangible assets and acquired technologies, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll tax, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in fair value of derivative instruments, litigation costs for matters in which we are the plaintiff and related antitrust matters, costs associated with the acquisition and integration of completed and potential M A and costs related to equity transactions, including secondary offerings.

Free Cash Flow 
 We believe that Free Cash Flow, as defined below, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our ability to generate cash and fund our operations and capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for the purchases of software, equipment, and property. 
 The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have financed our operations with cash flows from operations. The Company generated 170.2 million of cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 286.3 million, a working capital surplus of 320.9 million and an accumulated deficit totaling 1,101.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 778.0 million aggregate principal outstanding on its term loan. 
 37 

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, fund required long-term debt repayments and meet our commitments for capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
 Although we are not currently a party to any material definitive agreement regarding potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, applications or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements, which could reduce our cash and cash equivalents or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds from financing arrangements may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 
 Debt 
 On September 21, 2021, CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, together with certain of the Company s subsidiaries acting as guarantors entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the "2021 Credit Agreement"). 
 The proceeds of the 2021 Credit Agreement and cash on hand were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Company's previous credit agreement. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement consists of an 800.0 million term loan ("Term B Loan") and a revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of 250.0 million (the "2021 Revolving Credit Facility" and together with the Term B Loan, the "2021 Credit Facilities"). The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility has a sublimit of 75.0 million for letters of credit. The Company received proceeds of 798.0 million, net of debt discount of 2.0 million, related to the Term B Loan. 
 The Term B Loan requires quarterly principal payments of 2.0 million until June 30, 2028, with the remaining outstanding principal amount required to be paid on the maturity date, September 21, 2028. If the Company's leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement is greater than 3.5, the Term B Loan requires a principal prepayment, subject to certain exceptions, in connection with the receipt of proceeds from certain asset sales, casualty events and debt issuances by the Company, and up to 50 of annual excess cash flow, as defined in and as further set forth in the 2021 Credit Agreement. When a principal prepayment is required, the prepayment offsets the future quarterly principal payments of the same amount. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's leverage ratio did not exceed the 3.5 threshold and the Company was not subject to the annual excess cash flow calculation and, as such, was not required to make a principal prepayment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the amount outstanding on the Term B Loan was 778.0 million, of which, 8.0 million is classified as current. 
 Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on the ratio of CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries consolidated first lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for applicable periods specified in the 2021 Credit Agreement. 
 In May 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the "First Amendment") to establish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as the benchmark rate for determining the applicable interest rate, replacing the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR"). No other terms, including the amount of borrowings, required payments or maturity date, were changed as a result of the First Amendment. 
 Subsequent to the execution of the First Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the loans is based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the sum of an applicable rate and term SOFR (other than with respect to Euros, the Euro Interbank Offer Rate ("EURIBOR") and with respect to British Pounds Sterling, Sterling Overnight Indexed Average ("SONIA")) with a term, as selected by the Company, of one, three or six months (subject to (x) in the case of term loans, a 0.50 per annum floor and (y) in the case of revolving loans, a 0.00 per annum floor. 
 Prior to the execution of the First Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the loans was based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the sum of an applicable rate and, at the Company s election from time to time, either: 
 (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the rate last quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the "prime rate," (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50 , (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00 and (d) with respect to the Term B Loan, 1.50 and with respect to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, 1.00 , or 

(2) a Eurocurrency rate determined by reference to LIBOR (other than with respect to Euros, EURIBOR and with respect to British Pounds Sterling, SONIA) with a term, as selected by the Company, of one, three or six months (subject to (x) in the case of term loans, a 0.50 per annum floor and (y) in the case of revolving loans, a 0.00 per annum floor). 

In September 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the "Second Amendment") to (i) remove the SOFR credit adjustment applicable to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) reduce the applicable interest rate for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility by 0.25 . Additionally, the maturity date for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility was extended 
 38 

to September 23, 2029, subject to a springing maturity date of June 22, 2028 if greater than 234.0 million of the initial Term B Loan remains outstanding as of such date. 
 A quarterly commitment fee of up to 0.50 is payable on the unused portion of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted-average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Term B Loan was 7.8 and 7.7 , respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted-average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Term B Loan was 7.8 and 7.3 , respectively. 
 The Company has an outstanding standby letter of credit for 0.7 million which reduces the amount available to be borrowed under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, 249.3 million was available to be borrowed under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement include a financial covenant which requires that, at the end of each fiscal quarter, if the aggregate amount of borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35 of the aggregate commitments, the leverage ratio of CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries cannot exceed 6.25 to 1.00. Borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility did not exceed 35 of the aggregate commitments and the Company was not subject to the leverage test as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Caps In August 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements, as amended, to reduce its exposure to increases in interest rates applicable to its floating rate long-term debt. The amended interest rate cap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of 600.0 million and a one-month SOFR cap rate of 4.00 through their expiration in July 2025.

The change in working capital was primarily a result of an increase in accounts receivable of 27.2 million due to timing of cash receipts from customers and a decrease in accrued expenses of 14.9 million due to timing of cash disbursements and employee incentive plan payments, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of 5.5 million due to timing of payments to suppliers.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the Borrower would not be in compliance with Section 6.14(a) if any Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Dollars were to be translated into Dollars on the basis of the applicable Exchange Rate used in preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) , as applicable, for the relevant Test Period, but would be in compliance with Section 6.14(a) if such Indebtedness that is denominated in a currency other than in Dollars were instead translated into Dollars on the basis of the average relevant Exchange Rates over such Test Period (taking into account the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of any Hedge Agreement permitted hereunder in respect of currency exchange risks with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination for the Dollar Equivalent amount of such Indebtedness), then, solely for purposes of compliance with Section 6.14(a) , the First Lien Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such Test Period shall be calculated on the basis of such average relevant Exchange Rates. 

(b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify with the Borrower s consent to appropriately reflect a change in currency of any country and any relevant market convention or practice relating to such change in currency.

(b) For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires a calculation of any financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, Section 6.14(a) hereof, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test and/or the amount of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets), such financial ratio or test shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to clause (a) above), such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or test occurring after such calculation. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, Section 6.14(a) hereof, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the Fixed Amounts substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that requires compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, Section 6.14(a) hereof, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the Incurrence-Based Amounts ), it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of the financial ratio or test applicable to the Incurrence-Based Amounts; provided that the incurrence of 

62 

Indebtedness or Liens constituting Fixed Amounts shall be taken into account for purposes of Incurrence-Based Amounts under Article 6 (other than Sections 6.01 and 6.02 ); provided , further , that any Revolving Loans borrowed in connection with any transactions pursuant to which an Incurrence-Based Amount is being determined shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the applicable Incurrence-Based Amounts. 

(d) The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Borrower dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

(e) The increase in amounts secured by Liens by virtue of accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, amortization of original issue discount and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Liens for purposes of Section 6.02 . 

Section 1.11. Divisions . For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction s laws), if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Restricted Subsidiary becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from such Restricted Subsidiary to the subsequent Person. 

Section 1.12. Effect of Benchmark Transition Event . 

(a)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined with respect to an Applicable Currency, that: 
 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency for any Interest Period hereunder or any other tenors of such Relevant Rate, including because the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency is not available or published on a current basis at such time and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 

(ii) the administrator of the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans denominated in such Applicable Currency, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency after such specific date (such specific date, the Scheduled Unavailability Date ); or 

(iii) the administrator of the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such administrator has made a public statement announcing that all Interest Periods and other tenors of the Relevant Rate are no longer representative; or 

(iv) syndicated loans being executed at the time of such determination, or that include language similar to that contained in this Section 1.12 , are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency, 

or if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 1.12(a)(i) , (ii) or (iii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice from the Borrower or (I) with respect to Term SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars, the Required Lenders or (II) with respect to Revolving Loans denominated in an Applicable Currency (other than Dollars), the Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.02 , the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the Relevant Rate for such Applicable Currency or any then-current Successor Rate for such 
 63 

Applicable Currency in accordance with this Section 1.12 with (x) in the case of Term SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars, one or more Successor Rates or (y) in the case of any Applicable Currency with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for comparable syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks for such Applicable Currency and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for comparable syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks for such Applicable Currency (any such proposed rate, a Successor Rate ). Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with prevailing market practice for comparable syndicated loans being executed at the time of such determination; provided that to the extent such prevailing market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than (a) solely with respect to the Initial Term Loans, 0.50 per annum, then such Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0.50 per annum and (b) solely with respect to the Initial Revolving Loans, 0 per annum, then such Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0 per annum, in each case for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Successor Rate Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement (other than the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)); provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Successor Rate Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 (b) If, at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with clause (a) of this Section 1.12 or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender and thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Relevant Rate in any Applicable Currency with respect to which such circumstances exist shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods) and (y) the Relevant Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Alternate Base Rate, until the Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with clause (a) for such Applicable Currency. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of the Loans (to the extent of the affected Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods) or, failing that, (i) (A) if the requested Loans are denominated in Dollars, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (y) in the amount specified therein), and (B) if the requested Loans are denominated in an Applicable Currency other than Dollars, any such request shall be deemed to have been converted to an ABR Borrowing in the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 

Section 1.13. Interest Rates . The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to any reference rate referred to herein or with respect to any rate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the selection of such rate and any related spread or other adjustment) that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any such rate (including, without limitation, any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Successor Rate Conforming Changes. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions or other activities that affect any reference rate referred to herein, or any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including, without limitation, any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing) or any related spread or other adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to any Borrower.

Each Swingline Loan shall be in a minimum principal amount of not less than 100,000 or such lesser amount as may be agreed by the Swingline Lender; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Swingline Loan may be in an aggregate amount that is (x) equal to the entire unused balance of the aggregate unused Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e) . Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Swingline Loans may be borrowed, prepaid and reborrowed. To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such request by delivery of a written Borrowing Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan.

(b) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to purchase participations on the second Business Day following receipt of such notice in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or any reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by effecting a wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) ), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participation in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) , and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower in respect of any Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of any sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted by the Swingline Lender to the Administrative Agent, and any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that have made their payments pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and thereafter to the Borrower, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. 

(c) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04 by the time specified in Section 2.04(b) , the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 

67

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, BofA may, upon ten days prior written notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as Swingline Lender, which resignation shall be effective as of the date referenced in such notice (but in no event less than ten days after the delivery of such written notice). In the event of any such resignation, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint any Revolving Lender that is willing to accept such appointment as successor Swingline Lender hereunder. Upon the acceptance of any such appointment, the successor Swingline Lender shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swingline Lender, and the retiring Swingline Lender, as applicable, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations in such capacity hereunder. In the event that the successor Swingline Lender resigns, the Borrower shall promptly repay all outstanding Swingline Loans on the effective date of such resignation (which repayment may be effectuated with the proceeds of a Borrowing).

To the extent required by the applicable Issuing Bank in the case of the issuance of any Letter of Credit expressly for the benefit of any Subsidiary other than a Loan Party, the issuance of such Letter of Credit shall be contingent upon the Administrative Agent s receipt of any documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act.

To request an amendment, extension or renewal of an outstanding Letter of Credit (other than any automatic extension of a Letter of Credit permitted under Section 2.05(c) ), the Borrower shall submit such a request to the applicable Issuing Bank selected by the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least three Business Days in advance of the requested date of amendment, extension or renewal (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank), identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended or renewed, and specifying the proposed date (which shall be a Business Day) and other details of the amendment, extension or renewal. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank in connection with any request for any Letter of Credit, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank s standard form. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the applicable Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. No Letter of Credit, letter of

credit application or other document entered into by the Borrower with any Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit shall contain any representations or warranties, covenants or events of default not set forth in this Agreement (and to the extent inconsistent herewith shall be rendered null and void (or reformed automatically without further action by any Person to conform to the terms of this Agreement)), and all representations and warranties, covenants and events of default set forth therein shall contain standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions for materiality or otherwise consistent with those set forth in this Agreement (and, to the extent inconsistent herewith, shall be deemed to automatically incorporate the applicable standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions set forth herein without action by any Person). No Letter of Credit may be issued, amended, extended or renewed unless (and on the issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension, or renewal (i) the LC Exposure does not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, (ii)(A) the aggregate amount of the Initial Revolving Credit Exposure does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Initial Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect, (B) the aggregate amount of the Additional Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to any Class of Additional Revolving Credit Commitments does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Additional Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect and (C) if such Letter of Credit has a term extending beyond the Maturity Date applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class, the aggregate amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit expiring after such Maturity Date does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect that are scheduled to remain in effect after such Maturity Date. 

(iii) An Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: 

(A) any order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such Issuing Bank deems material to it; 

(B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any laws binding upon such Issuing Bank; 

(C) if after giving effect thereto, the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at such time would exceed such Issuing Bank s LC Commitment; or 

(D) in the case of Barclays Bank PLC, Citibank, N.A., Jefferies Finance LLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, if such Letter of Credit is a Commercial Letter of Credit or trade Letter of Credit. 

(b) Expiration Date . 

(i) 	No Standby Letter of Credit shall expire later than the earlier of (A) the date that is one year after the date of the issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit and (B) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date; provided that, any Standby Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic extension thereof for any number of additional periods of up to one year in duration (which additional periods shall not extend beyond the date referred to in the preceding clause (B) unless 100 of the then-available face amount thereof is Cash collateralized or backstopped on or before the date that such Letter of Credit is extended beyond the date referred to in clause (B) above pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank).

(ii) 	No Commercial Letter of Credit shall expire later than the earlier to occur of (A) 180 days after the issuance thereof and (B) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date. 
 (c) Participations . 

(i) By the issuance of any Letter of Credit (or an amendment to any Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section , or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. 

(d) Reimbursement . 

(i) 	If the applicable Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Commercial Letters of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank) an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 11:00 a.m. two Business Days (or, three Business Days, if such notice is not received prior to the time the Borrower is required to deliver a notice of borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 for any Revolving Loan (other than a Swingline Loan)) immediately following the date on which the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement under paragraph (g) of this Section ; provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with a Swingline Loan Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the obligation of the Borrower to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Swingline Loan (subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 ). If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of any applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender s Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Revolving Credit Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. 
 (ii) 	If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(d) by the time specified therein, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the applicable Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 70 

(e) Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute and unconditional and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section , constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the obligations of the Borrower hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 

(f) Disbursement Procedures . The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by electronic means) upon any LC Disbursement thereunder and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that no failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 

(g) Interim Interest . If any Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, unless the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement (or the date on which such LC Disbursement is reimbursed with the proceeds of Loans, as applicable), at the rate per annum then applicable to Initial Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans or, if such LC Disbursement is not denominated in Dollars, at a rate per annum then applicable to Initial Revolving Loans denominated in such currency (or, to the extent of the participation in such LC Disbursement by any Revolving Lender of another Class, the rate per annum then applicable to the Revolving Loans of such other Class); provided that if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment and shall be payable on the date on which the Borrower is required to reimburse the applicable LC Disbursement in full (and, thereafter, on demand). 

(h) Replacement or Resignation of an Issuing Bank or Designation of New Issuing Banks . 

(i) 	Any Issuing Bank may be replaced with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement becomes effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b)(ii) . From and after the 
 71 

effective date of any such replacement, (a) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (b) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the relevant Revolving Lender, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders in writing to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement. Any Revolving Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph (i) who agrees in writing to such designation shall be deemed to be an Issuing Bank (in addition to being a Revolving Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Revolving Lender, and, with respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Banks and such Revolving Lender. 
 (ii) 	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Issuing Bank may, upon ten days prior written notice to the Borrower, each other Issuing Bank and the Lenders, resign as an Issuing Bank, which resignation shall be effective as of the date referenced in such notice (but in no event less than ten days after the delivery of such written notice); it being understood that in the event of any such resignation, any Letter of Credit then outstanding shall remain outstanding (irrespective of whether any amounts have been drawn at such time). In the event of any such resignation as an Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint any Revolving Lender that accepts such appointment in writing as successor Issuing Bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Issuing Bank hereunder, the successor Issuing Bank shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, and the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its duties and obligations in such capacity hereunder. 
 (i) Cash Collateralization . 

(i) 	If any Event of Default exists and the Loans have been declared due and payable in accordance with Article 7 hereof, then on the Business Day on which the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Revolving Lenders demanding the deposit of Cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph (i) , the Borrower shall deposit, in an interest-bearing account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the LC Collateral Account ), an amount in Cash equal to 100 of the LC Exposure as of such date minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account); provided that the obligation to deposit such Cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Sections 7.01(f) or (g) . 
 (ii) 	Any such deposit under clause (i) above shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (i) . The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account, and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a First Priority security interest in the LC Collateral Account. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders) be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (together with all interest and other earnings with respect thereto, to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower promptly but in no event later than three Business Days after such Event of Default has been cured or waived.

Section 2.07. Funding of Borrowings . 

(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder not later than 1:00 p.m., in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Borrowing Request by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lender s respective Applicable Percentage; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04 . The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account designated in the relevant Borrowing Request or as otherwise directed by the Borrower; provided that Swingline Loans made to finance the reimbursement of any LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. 

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from any Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing (or, in the case of any Borrowing of ABR Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of any Borrowing prior to the proposed date of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if any Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans comprising such Borrowing at such time. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing and the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) shall cease. If the Borrower pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, the amount so paid shall constitute a repayment of such Borrowing by such amount. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower or any other Loan Party may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 

Section 2.08. Type; Interest Elections . 

(a) Each Borrowing shall initially be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of any LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request; provided that any Revolving Loan Borrowing in a Revolving Alternative Currency (other than British Pounds Sterling) shall be a LIBO Rate Borrowing and any Revolving Loan Borrowing in British Pounds Sterling shall be an RFR Loan. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section . The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders based upon their Applicable Percentages and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section 2.08 shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued. 

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section , the Borrower shall (i) deliver an Interest Election Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower or (ii) provide telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a written Interest Election Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower) of the applicable election to the Administrative Agent; provided that, in each case under this Section 2.08(b) , such Interest Election Request must be received by the Administrative Agent (by hand delivery, fax or other electronic transmission (including .pdf or .tif )) not later than (i) 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days prior to the requested day of any Borrowing, conversion or continuation of LIBO Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans and (ii) 11:00 a.m. on the requested date of any Borrowing of ABR Loans (or, in each case, such later time as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent); provided , however , that if the Borrower wishes to request LIBO Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans having an Interest Period of other than one, three or six 

73 

months in duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, (A) the applicable notice from the Borrower must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of the relevant Borrowing, conversion or continuation (or such later time as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the appropriate Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is available to them and (B) not later than 12:00 noon three (3) Business Days before the requested date of the relevant Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower whether or not the requested Interest Period is available to the appropriate Lenders. 

If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. 
 (c) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 

(d) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, such Borrowing shall be converted at the end of such Interest Period to a LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if an Event of Default exists and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default exists (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing, as applicable, shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the then-current Interest Period applicable thereto. 

Section 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments . 

(a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Initial Term Loan Commitments on the Closing Date shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Initial Term Loans on the Closing Date, (ii) the Initial Revolving Credit Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Initial Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (iii) the Additional Term Loan Commitments of any Class shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Additional Term Loans of such Class and, if any such Additional Term Loan Commitment is not drawn on the date that such Additional Term Loan Commitment is required to be drawn pursuant to the applicable Refinancing Amendment or Incremental Facility Amendment, the undrawn amount thereof shall automatically terminate and (iv) the Additional Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date specified therefor in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Extension Amendment or Incremental Facility Amendment. 

(b) Upon delivery of the notice required by Section 2.09(c) , the Borrower may at any time terminate or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of 1,000,000 and not less than 1,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class would exceed the aggregate amount Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class; provided that, after the establishment of any Additional Revolving Credit Commitments, any such termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.22 , 2.23 and/or 9.02 , as applicable. 

(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce any Revolving Credit Commitment under paragraph (b) of this Section in writing at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction (or such later date to which the Administrative Agent may agree), specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Revolving Lenders of each applicable Class of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice may state that it is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked or delayed by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied or 

74 

is delayed. Any termination or reduction of any Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be permanent. Upon any reduction of any Revolving Credit Commitment, the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Lender of the relevant Class shall be reduced by such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage of such reduction amount.

(a) (i) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to repay the outstanding principal amount of the Initial Term Loans to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender (x) commencing March 31, 2022, on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December prior to the Initial Term Loan Maturity Date (each such date being referred to as a Loan Installment Date ), in each case in an amount equal to 0.25 of the original principal amount of the Initial Term Loans (as such payments may be reduced from time to time as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with Section 2.11 and repurchases in accordance with Section 9.05(g) or increased as a result of any increase in the amount of such Initial Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.22(a) ), and (y) on the Initial Term Loan Maturity Date, in an amount equal to the remainder of the principal amount of the Initial Term Loans outstanding on such date, together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment.

(h) The Administrative Agent shall promptly upon the amount of any RFR Interest Payment becoming determinable notify (i) (such notification to be made no later than three applicable RFR Business Days prior to the due date for such RFR Interest Payment) the relevant Borrower of the amount of that RFR Interest Payment; and (ii) the relevant Lenders and the Borrower of each applicable rate of interest and the amount of interest for each day relating to the determination of that RFR Interest Payment (including a breakdown of such rate and amount of interest as between the Applicable Rate and the Daily Simple RFR for such date and any other information that the Borrower may reasonably request in relation to the calculation of such rate and amount or the determination of that RFR Interest Payment). 

Section 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest . (a) 	If at least two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBO Rate Borrowing or a Term SOFR Borrowing: 

(i) 	the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate or Term SOFR, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or 
 (ii) 	the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate or Term SOFR, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; 
 then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the 
 82 

Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, which the Administrative Agent agrees promptly to do, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Loans in the affected currencies, as applicable, shall be suspended in each case to the extent of the affected Revolving Alternative Currency Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable, (ii) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing, as applicable, shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (iii) if any Borrowing Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing or Term SOFR Borrowing, as applicable, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. 
 Section 2.15. Increased Costs . 

(a) If any Change in Law: 

(i) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the LIBO Rate, Term SOFR or Daily Simple RFR) or Issuing Bank; 

(ii) subject any Lender or Issuing Bank to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes indemnifiable under Section 2.17 and (B) Excluded Taxes) on or with respect to its loans, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 

(iii) imposes on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the applicable offshore interbank market any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBO Rate Loans, Term SOFR Loans or RFR Loans made by any Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the relevant Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Rate Loan, Term SOFR Loan or RFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any LIBO Rate Loan, Term SOFR Loan, RFR Loan or Letter of Credit in an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Bank to be material, then, within 30 days after the Borrower s receipt of the certificate contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section , the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that the Borrower shall not be liable for such compensation if (x) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto, (y) such Lender invokes Section 2.20 or (z) in the case of requests for reimbursement under clause (iii) above resulting from a market disruption, (A) the relevant circumstances are not generally affecting the banking market or (B) the applicable request has not been made by Lenders constituting Required Lenders. 
 (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding liquidity or capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law other than due to Taxes (taking into consideration such Lender s or Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then within 30 days of receipt by the Borrower of the certificate contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Any Lender or Issuing Bank requesting compensation under this Section 2.15 shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Borrower that (i) sets forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or the holding company thereof, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section , (ii) sets forth, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (iii) certifies that 

83 

such Lender or Issuing Bank is generally charging such amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation; provided , however that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided , further , that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 

Section 2.16. Break Funding Payments . Subject to Section 9.05(f) , in the event of (a) the conversion or prepayment of any principal of any LIBO Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise), (b) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBO Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (c) the assignment of any LIBO Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, of any Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 , then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense incurred by such Lender that is attributable to such event (other than loss of profit). In the case of a LIBO Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan, as applicable, the loss, cost or expense of any Lender shall be the amount reasonably determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred at the LIBO Rate or Term SOFR, as applicable, that would have been applicable to such Loan for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the applicable interbank market; it being understood that such loss, cost or expense shall in any case exclude any interest rate floor and all administrative, processing or similar fees. Any Lender requesting compensation under this Section 2.16 shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Borrower that (A) sets forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section , the basis therefor and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (B) certifies that such Lender is generally charging the relevant amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. 

Section 2.17. Taxes . 

(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Requirements of Law. If any applicable Requirement of Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax and/or Other Tax, the amount payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or withholdings have been made (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17 each Lender (or, in the case of any payment made to the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law. 

(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law. 

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 30 days after receipt of the certificate described in the succeeding sentence, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable (including Indemnified Taxes or 

84 

Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17 ), and, in each case, any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not correctly or legally imposed or asserted. In connection with any request for reimbursement under this Section 2.17(c) , the relevant Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis and calculation of the amount of the relevant payment or liability. 

(d) [Reserved]. 

(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of any Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.17 by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued, if any, by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 

(f) Status of Lenders . 

(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any withholding Tax with respect to any payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation as the Borrower or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Borrower and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.17(f) . 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

(A) each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two executed original copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding; 

(B) each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 

(1) in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the U.S. is a party, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing any available exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax; 

(2) two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms); 

(3) in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, (x) two executed original copies of a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit O-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no payments payable to such Lender are effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (a U.S. Tax 

85 

Compliance Certificate and (y) two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or any successor forms); or 

(4) to the extent any Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (e.g., where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating Lender), two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms), accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit O-2 , Exhibit O-3 or Exhibit O-4 , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if such Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit O-3 on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner(s); 

(C) each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two executed original copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 

(D) if a payment made to any Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation as is prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. 

For the avoidance of doubt, if a Lender is an entity disregarded from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, references to the foregoing documentation are intended to refer to documentation with respect to such Lender s owner and, as applicable, such Lender. 
 Each Lender agrees that if any documentation it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect (including any specific documentation required above in this Section 2.17(f) ), it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal ineligibility to do so. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(f) , no Lender shall be required to provide any documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 (g) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund (whether received in cash or applied as a credit against any cash taxes of the same type payable) of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17 , it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund), and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided 

86 

that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g) , in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (g) to the extent that the payment thereof would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the position that the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.17 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the relevant Loan Party or any other Person. 

(h) Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 

(i) Definition of Lender . For the avoidance of doubt, the term Lender shall, for all purposes of this Section 2.17 , include any Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender. 

(j) On or before the date the Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to Borrower whichever of the following is applicable: (i) if the Administrative Agent is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Administrative Agent is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding or (ii) if the Administrative Agent is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (A) with respect to payments received for its own account, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8ECI and (B) with respect to payments received on account of any Lender, two executed original copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (together with all required accompanying documentation) certifying that the Administrative Agent is a U.S. branch and may be treated as a United States person for purposes of applicable U.S. federal withholding Tax. At any time thereafter, the Administrative Agent shall provide updated documentation previously provided (or a successor form thereto) when any documentation previously delivered has expired or become obsolete or invalid or otherwise upon the reasonable request of the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(j) , the Administrative Agent shall not be required to provide any documentation that the Administrative Agent is not legally eligible to deliver as a result of a Change in Law after the Closing Date. 

Section 2.18. Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Payments . 

(a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15 , 2.16 or 2.17 , or otherwise) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the date when due, in immediately available funds. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15 , 2.16 , 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Person or Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.19(b) and 2.20 , each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans of a given Class and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type (and of the same Class) shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages of the applicable Class. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender s portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender s percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent 

87 

shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment. 

(b) All proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent while an Event of Default exists and all or any portion of the Loans have been accelerated hereunder pursuant to Section 7.01 , shall be applied, first , to the payment of all costs and expenses then due incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any collection, sale or realization on Collateral or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Loan Party and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, second , on a pro rata basis, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent (other than those covered in clause first above) or to the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank from the Borrower constituting Secured Obligations, third , on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amounts of the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has yet been made) owed to the Secured Parties on the date of any such distribution, to the payment in full of the Secured Obligations (including, with respect to LC Exposure, an amount to be paid to the Administrative Agent equal to 100 of the LC Exposure minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account) on such date, to be held in the LC Collateral Account as Cash collateral for such Obligations); provided that if any Letter of Credit expires undrawn, then any Cash collateral held to secure the related LC Exposure shall be applied in accordance with this Section 2.18(b) , beginning with clause first above, and fourth , to, or at the direction of, the Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. 

(c) If any Lender obtains payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of any Class or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans held by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender with Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for Cash at face value) participations in the Loans of such Class and sub-participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans of other Lenders of such Class at such time outstanding to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by any Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any permitted assignee or participant, including any payment made or deemed made in connection with Sections 2.22 , 2.23 , 9.02(c) and/or Section 9.05 . The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.18(c) and will, in each case, notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.18(c) shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. For purposes of subclause (c) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, a Lender that acquires a participation pursuant to this Section 2.18(c) shall be treated as having acquired such participation on the earlier date(s) on which such Lender acquired the applicable interest(s) in the Commitment(s) and/or Loan(s) to which such participation relates. 

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable 

88 

Lender or Issuing Bank the amount due. With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the Rescindable Amount ): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this clause (d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 

(e) If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or Section 2.18(d) , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 

Section 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . 

(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans, Term SOFR Loans or RFR Loans pursuant to Section 2.20 , or any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or its participation in any Letter of Credit affected by such event, or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17 , as applicable, in the future or mitigate the impact of Section 2.20 , as the case may be, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed out-of-pocket cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 

(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans, Term SOFR Loans or RFR Loans pursuant to Section 2.20 , (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 , (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of each Lender, each Revolving Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby (or any other Class or group of Lenders other than the Required Lenders) with respect to which Required Lender or Required Revolving Lender consent (or the consent of Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of such Class or lesser group representing more than 50 of the sum of the total Loans and unused Commitments of such Class or lesser group at such time) has been obtained, as applicable, any Lender is a non-consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate the applicable Commitments of such Lender, and repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the applicable Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date provided that, if, after giving effect such termination and repayment, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Class exceeds the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect, then the Borrower shall, not later than the next Business Day, prepay one or more Revolving Loan Borrowings of the applicable Class or Swingline Loans (and, if no Revolving Loan Borrowings of such Class are outstanding, deposit Cash collateral in the LC Collateral Account) in an amount necessary to eliminate such excess) or (y) replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall be obligated to assign and delegate), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.05 ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if any Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (A) such Lender has received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and, if applicable, participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, in each case of such Class of Loans and/or Commitments, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it under any Loan Document

with respect to such Class of Loans and/or Commitments, (B) in the case of any assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17 , such assignment would result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (C) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law. No Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) shall be required to make any such assignment and delegation, and the Borrower may not repay the Obligations of such Lender or terminate its Commitments, if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that if it is replaced pursuant to this Section 2.19 , it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Promissory Note (if the assigning Lender s Loans are evidenced by one or more Promissory Notes) subject to such Assignment and Assumption provided that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this Section 2.19 to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver any such Promissory Note shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid), such assignment shall be recorded in the Register, any such Promissory Note shall be deemed cancelled. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Lender s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, from time to time in the Administrative Agent s discretion, with prior written notice to such Lender, to take any action and to execute any such Assignment and Assumption or other instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (b) . To the extent that any Lender is replaced pursuant to Section 2.19(b)(iv) in connection with a Repricing Transaction requiring payment of a fee pursuant to Section 2.12(f) , the Borrower shall pay to each Lender being replaced as a result of such Repricing Transaction the fee set forth in Section 2.12(f) . 

Section 2.20. Illegality . If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Published LIBO Rate, SOFR, Term SOFR or SONIA, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate, SOFR, Term SOFR or SONIA, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of Dollars or any Revolving Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBO Rate Loans, Term SOFR Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, or to convert ABR Loans to LIBO Rate Loans, Term SOFR Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Published LIBO Rate or Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Published LIBO Rate or Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from the relevant Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or convert all of such Lender s LIBO Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Published LIBO Rate or Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate) either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans (in which case the Borrower shall not be required to make payments pursuant to Section 2.16 in connection with such payment), (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Published LIBO Rate or Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Published LIBO Rate or Term SOFR and (z) in the case of any Loans denominated in a Revolving Alternative Currency, prepay all such Loans, as applicable, in the affected currency or currencies. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the determination of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

 then, and in every such event (other than (x) an event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (f) or (g) of this Article or (y) any Event of Default arising under Section 6.14(a) ), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take any of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments, and thereupon such Commitments shall terminate immediately, (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower and (iii) require that the Borrower deposit in the LC Collateral Account an additional amount in Cash as reasonably requested by the Issuing Banks (not to exceed 100 of the relevant face amount) of the then outstanding LC Exposure minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account); provided that (A) upon the occurrence of an event with respect to the Borrower described in clauses (f) or (g) of this Article , any such Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower, and the obligation of the Borrower to Cash collateralize the outstanding Letters of Credit as aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further action of the Administrative Agent or any Lender and (B) during the continuance of any Event of Default arising under Section 6.14(a) , (X) upon the request of the Required Revolving Lenders (but not the Required Lenders or any other Lender or group of Lenders), the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, (1) terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments, and thereupon such Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate immediately, (2) declare the Revolving Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Revolving Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower and (3) require that the Borrower deposit in the LC Collateral Account an additional amount in Cash as reasonably requested by the Issuing Banks (not to exceed 100 of the relevant face amount) of the then outstanding LC Exposure minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account) and (Y) subject to the Financial Covenant Standstill, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

 ARTICLE 8 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 

Section 8.01. Agents . 

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints BofA (or any successor appointed pursuant hereto) as Administrative Agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, 
 139 

including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 
 Any Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, unless the context otherwise requires or unless such Person is in fact not a Lender, include each Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them. 
 The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default exists, and the use of the term agent herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Requirements of Law; it being understood that such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers that are expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents and which the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the relevant circumstances as provided in Section 9.02 ); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Requirements of Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as is necessary, or as the Administrative Agent believes in good faith shall be necessary, under the relevant circumstances as provided in Section 9.02 or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or any Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any covenant, agreement or other term or condition set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien on the Collateral or the existence, value or sufficiency of the Collateral or to assure that the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document have been or will continue to be properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or (vii) any property, book or record of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof. 
 Each Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent may from time to time use one or more outside service providers for the tracking of all UCC financing statements (and/or other collateral related filings and registrations from time to time) required to be filed or recorded pursuant to the Loan Documents and the notification to the Administrative Agent, of, among other things, the upcoming lapse or expiration thereof. The 
 140 

Secured Parties agree that the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to the Secured Parties for any action taken or not taken by any such service provider. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Loan Guaranty; it being understood that any realization upon the Collateral or enforcement on any Loan Guaranty against the Loan Parties pursuant hereto or pursuant to any Loan Document may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or in the event of any other Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), (A) the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply all or any portion of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such Disposition and (B) the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of all or any portion of such Collateral at any such Disposition. 
 No holder of any Secured Hedging Obligation or Banking Services Obligation in its respective capacity as such shall have any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under this Agreement. 
 Each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion, but is under no obligation to, credit bid any part of the Secured Obligations or to purchase or retain or acquire any portion of the Collateral. 
 The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) that it believes to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent has received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article 8 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent. The Secured Parties agree that the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Secured Parties for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent. 
 The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving ten days written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower; provided that if no successor agent is appointed in accordance with the terms set forth below within such 10-day period, the Administrative Agent s resignation shall not be effective until the earlier to occur of (x) the date of the appointment of the successor agent or (y) the date that is twenty (20) days after the last day of such 10-day period. If the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender, either the Required Lenders or the Borrower may, upon ten days notice, remove the Administrative Agent; provided that if no successor agent is appointed in accordance with the terms set forth below within such 10-day period, the 
 141 

Administrative Agent s removal shall, at the option of the Borrower, not be effective until the earlier to occur of (x) the date of the appointment of the successor agent or (y) the date that is twenty (20) days after the last day of such 10-day period. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or delivery of any such notice of removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank or trust company with offices in the U.S. having combined capital and surplus in excess of 1,000,000,000; provided that during the existence of an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a) or, with respect to any Borrower, Section 7.01(f) or (g) , no consent of the Borrower shall be required. If no successor has been appointed as provided above and accepted such appointment within ten days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or the Administrative Agent receives notice of removal, then (a) in the case of a retirement, the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the consent of the Borrower) or (b) in the case of a removal, the Borrower may, after consulting with the Required Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that (x) in the case of a retirement, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment or (y) in the case of a removal, the Borrower notifies the Required Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then, in each case, such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with the provisos to the first two sentences in this paragraph and (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as collateral agent for the Secured Parties for purposes of maintaining the perfection of the Lien on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations required to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Bank directly (and each Lender and each Issuing Bank will cooperate with the Borrower to enable the Borrower to take such actions), until such time as the Required Lenders or the Borrower, as applicable, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, as provided above in this Article 8 . Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder as a successor Administrative Agent, the successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (other than its obligations under Section 9.13 hereof). The fees payable by the Borrower to any successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor Administrative Agent. After the Administrative Agent s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the relevant Person was acting as Administrative Agent (including for this purpose holding any collateral security following the retirement or removal of the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Disqualified Institution (nor any Affiliate thereof) may be appointed as a successor Administrative Agent. 
 Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their respective Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Each Lender and Issuing Bank acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Affiliate thereof has made any representation or warranty to it. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any Issuing Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties. 
 142 

Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement or an Assignment and Assumption and funding its Loan or assignment, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be approved by the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, on the Closing Date or, in the case of a Lender that becomes party hereto by Assignment and Assumption, thereafter and prior to the effectiveness of such Assignment and Assumption. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement, except in their respective capacities as the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, an Issuing Bank or a Lender hereunder, as applicable. 
 Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, to be the agent for and representative of the Secured Parties with respect to the Loan Guaranty, the Collateral and the Loan Documents; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not owe any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of care, duty of disclosure or any other obligation whatsoever to any holder of Obligations with respect to any Secured Hedging Obligations or Banking Services Obligations. 
 The Secured Parties agree that the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to the Secured Parties to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection (or continued perfection) of the Administrative Agent s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. 
 Each Secured Party irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to: 
 (a)	release any Lien on any property granted to or held by Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date, (ii) that is sold or to be sold or transferred as part of or in connection with any sale, transfer or other Disposition permitted under the Loan Documents to a Person that is not a Loan Party, (iii) that does not constitute (or ceases to constitute) Collateral (including upon becoming an Excluded Asset) as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents, (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its Loan Guaranty otherwise in accordance with the Loan Documents, (v) as required under clause (d) below or (vi) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9.02 ; 
 (b)	subject to Section 9.22 , release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a single transaction or series of related transactions permitted hereunder); provided that if any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an Excluded Subsidiary pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be released from its Loan Guaranty unless after giving pro forma effect to such release and the consummation of the relevant transaction, the Borrower is deemed to have made a new Investment in such Person (as if such Person was then newly acquired) and such Investment must not be otherwise prohibited by the Loan Documents; it being understood that this proviso shall not limit the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor that otherwise constitutes an Excluded Subsidiary for any reason other than pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof (this proviso, the Specified Guarantor Release Provision ); 
 (c)	subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Sections 6.02(d) , 6.02(e) , 6.02(g)(i) , 6.02(l) , 6.02(m) , 6.02(n) , 6.02(o)(i) (other than any Lien on the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary Guarantor), 6.02(q) , 6.02(r) (to the extent the relevant Lien is of the type to which the Lien of the Administrative Agent is otherwise required to be subordinated under this clause (c) pursuant to any of the other exceptions to Section 6.02 that are expressly included in this clause (c) ), 6.02(x) , 6.02(y) , 6.02(z)(i) , 6.02(bb) , 6.02(cc) , 6.02(ee) , 6.02(ff) and 6.02(gg) (and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any thereof to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be secured under Section 6.02(k)) ; provided , that the subordination of any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent shall only be required with respect to any Lien on such property that is permitted by Sections 6.02(l) , 6.02(o) , 
 143 

6.02(q) , 6.02(r) and/or 6.02(bb) to the extent that the Lien of the Administrative Agent with respect to such property is required to be subordinated to the relevant Permitted Lien in accordance with the documentation governing the Indebtedness that is secured by such Permitted Lien; and 
 (d)	enter into subordination, intercreditor and/or similar agreements with respect to Indebtedness (including any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and/or any amendment to the foregoing in accordance with Section 9.02 that is (i) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder and/or (ii) secured by Liens, and with respect to which Indebtedness, this Agreement contemplates an intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust agreement or similar agreement. 
 Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty or its Lien on any Collateral pursuant to this Article 8 . In each case as specified in this Article 8 , the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender, and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, to subordinate its interest therein, or to release such Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Article 8 ; provided , that upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall deliver a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying that the relevant transaction has been consummated in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this paragraph shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent. 
 The Administrative Agent is authorized to enter into any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement contemplated hereby, in each case, on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, with respect to any (a) Indebtedness permitted hereby (i) that is (A) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder and (B) secured by Liens permitted hereby and (ii) which contemplates an intercreditor, subordination or collateral trust agreement and/or (b) Secured Hedging Obligations and/or Banking Services Obligations, whether or not constituting Indebtedness (any such other intercreditor agreement an Additional Agreement ), and the Secured Parties party hereto acknowledge that any Additional Agreement is binding upon them. Each Secured Party party hereto hereby (a) agrees that it will be bound by, and will not take any action contrary to, the provisions of any Additional Agreement and (b) authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into any Additional Agreement and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations to the provisions thereof. The foregoing provisions are intended as an inducement to the Secured Parties to extend credit to the Borrower, and the Secured Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Agreement. 
 To the extent that the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower in accordance with and to the extent required by Section 9.03(b) hereof, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any Affiliate thereof) in proportion to their respective Applicable Percentages (determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate thereof) in performing its duties hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (in all cases, whether or not caused or arising, in whole or in part, out of the comparative, contributory or sole negligence of the Administrative Agent or any Affiliate thereof); provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent s (or such affiliate s) gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 To the extent required by any applicable Requirements of Law (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.17 , each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable 
 144 

in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. For the avoidance of doubt, the term Lender shall, for all purposes of this paragraph, include any Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender. 
 Section 8.02. Erroneous Payments . Without limitation of any other provision in this Agreement, if at any time the Administrative Agent makes a payment hereunder in error to any Lender Party, whether or not in respect of an Obligation due and owing by the Borrower at such time, where such payment is a Rescindable Amount, then in any such event, each Lender Party receiving a Rescindable Amount severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount received by such Lender Party in immediately available funds in the currency so received, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Rescindable Amount is received by it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Each Lender Party irrevocably waives any and all defenses, including any discharge for value (under which a creditor might otherwise claim a right to retain funds mistakenly paid by a third party in respect of a debt owed by another) or similar defense to its obligation to return any Rescindable Amount. The Administrative Agent shall inform each Lender Party promptly upon determining that any payment made to such Lender Party comprised, in whole or in part, a Rescindable Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, neither any Loan Party nor any of its respective Affiliates (other than any Affiliate Lender or Debt Fund Affiliate in its capacity as a Lender Party) shall have any obligation or liabilities for any actions, consequences or remediation (including the repayment of any amounts) contemplated by this Section 8.02 or Section 2.18(d) (including any Rescindable Amount); provided that under no circumstances shall this Section 8.02 or Section 2.18(d) affect the obligations or liabilities of any Loan Party or any of its respective Affiliates (other than any Affiliate Lender or Debt Fund Affiliate in its capacity as a Lender Party) with respect to any Obligations that remain outstanding.
