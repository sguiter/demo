MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. Background and Overview P2 Solar, Inc., incorporated in the State of Delaware, has been in existence as a Company (including its predecessor British Columbia Corporation) since 1990. the Company s current business operations are focused on the construction and installation of residential and commercial rooftop and ground mount solar energy systems in Canada. The Company is currently an emerging stage company. The Company has limited revenues and is dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management, significant stockholders or third parties to meet the cash requirements of the Company, but the Company has not entered into written agreements guaranteeing funds and, therefore, no one is obligated to provide funds to the Company in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Results of Operation The following discussion and analysis provide information that management of the Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operation and financial condition of the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s financial statements are stated in US Dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ).

The Company started to generate sales from installation of rooftop solar systems during Q1 ended June 30, 2023 upon the acquisition of Futricity in February 2023. Operating Expenses During the six months ended September 30 2024, the Company had operating expenses of 72,893 as compared to operating expenses of 113,314 during the six months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 40,421, or approximately 36 . The decrease in operating expenses was attributed to the decrease in professional fees and subcontract cost. Comprehensive Loss The Company had comprehensive loss of 75,314 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to comprehensive loss of 68,341 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in comprehensive loss was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss of 353 and a decrease in foreign currency loss of 6,620. 18 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital (Deficiency) Change Change September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 Amount Percentage Current Assets 12,795 24,358 (11,563 (47 Current Liabilities 1,934,719 1,866,782 67,936 4 Working Capital (Deficiency) (1,921,924 (1,842,424 (79,499 4 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s balance sheet reflects total current assets of 12,795 as compared to 24,358 as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 11,563 or approximately 47 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable as compared to March 31, 2024. The balance sheet of the Company reflects that as of September 30, 2024, it had total current liabilities of 1,934,719 as compared to total current liabilities of 1,866,782 at March 31, 2024, an increase of 67,936 or approximately of 4 . Working capital deficiency increased from 1,824,424 as of March 31, 2024 to 1,921,924 as of September 30, 2024 mainly due to the increase in due to related parties and accrued interest and the decrease in accounts receivable. The Company does not have sufficient assets or capital resources to pay its on-going expenses beyond March 31, 2024. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company raised CAD 110,000, it was allowed to raise under the terms of the partial revocation of the cease trade order imposed by the British Columbia Securities Commission. This money is enough to pay for all Audit and filing-related expenses. The Company has filed for final revocation of the cease trade order and expect the Cease Trade Order to be revoked in the next 30 to 45 days, however, there is no guarantee that it will happen. However, the company does not have the funds to continue its business plan. Some money for day-to-day expenses can be expected from its subsidiary Futricity Solar, Inc. as that company can fund its own expenses and installations from its own cash flow. To date, the Company has primarily financed its operations through equity investment from investors, shareholder loans, and credit facilities from Canadian chartered banks and increases in payables and share subscriptions. Most of the financing has been debt financing from related and unrelated parties. Currently, the estimated fixed costs of the Company are approximately 5,000 per month; that figure includes 500 for general and administrative expenses, 3,500 for professional fees, and 1,000 for miscellaneous expenses. The Company will have to raise approximately 5,000 per month to cover operating expenses, and additional funds to cover the expansion of solar installation business. The Company estimates that the total aggregate costs for expansion for solar installation business will be roughly 2,000,000. The Company anticipates that it will attempt to raise money from individual investors by selling convertible preferred shares. The Company is currently working on the terms of the preferred shares. Furthermore, the Company has had preliminary discussions with a number of groups regarding the financing; management is hopeful that the Company will be able to obtain financing. However, there is no guarantee that it will be successful in raising any additional capital. If management is unable to finance the Company by debt or equity financing, or a combination of the two, management will have to look for other sources of funding to meet the requirements of the Company. That source has not yet been identified. The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis under which an entity is considered to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Operations to date have been primarily financed by long-term debt and equity transactions as well as increases in payables and related party loans. The future operations of the Company are dependent upon the identification and successful completion of additional long-term or permanent equity financing, the continued support of creditors and shareholders, and, ultimately, the achievement of profitable operations. There can be no assurance that it will be successful. If the Company is not successful in raising further capital it will be required to reduce operations or liquidate assets. Management of the Company will continue to evaluate the projected expenditure of the Company relative to its available cash and to seek additional means of financing in order to satisfy working capital and other cash requirements. 19 Table of Contents Cash Flows Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash from (used in) Operating Activities (24,686 5,035 Cash from Financing Activities 26,472 23,477 Effects on changes in foreign exchange rate (1,765 (760 Net changes in cash during period 22 27,752 Operating Activities For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 24,686 related to our net loss of 67,560, decreased by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 42,874.

The loans and amounts owing to the related parties are unsecured, due on demand and non-interest bearing. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Emerging Growth Company The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company if it has total annual gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8, 2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act the Company is permitted to, and intends to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. The financial statements of the Company may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not Applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934 that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the filings of the Company under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow management of the Company to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company, who serves as the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company, evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company were not effective due to a control deficiency. During the period the Company did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of the information of the Company. Due to the size and operations of the Company management is unable to remediate this deficiency until it is able to attract additional directors and officers and other personnel. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting of the Company. 21 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
