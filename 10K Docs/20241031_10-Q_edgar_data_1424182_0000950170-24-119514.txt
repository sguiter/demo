Investment in properties under development, excluding capitalized costs 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and subsequent to reaching substantial completion, the Company funded an additional million of capital expenditures in connection with a development property.

impairment charges were recognized other than those described below. If the operating conditions mentioned above deteriorate or if the Company s expected holding period for assets changes, subsequent tests for impairments could result in additional impairment charges in the future. Inputs used in establishing fair value for impaired real estate assets generally fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs is current market conditions, as derived through the use of published commercial real estate market information and information obtained from brokers and other third party sources. The Company determines the valuation of impaired assets using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. Management may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 

Impairment charge 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized impairment of million and million, respectively, resulting from changes in the Company s long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties. The 2024 impairments primarily include million on two healthcare properties which was based on expected sales prices of the properties, and million on 11 healthcare properties sold as part of a portfolio with a gain of million, excluding any impairment, which was based on actual sales prices of the individual properties.

Fair value 

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements The Company s non-recurring fair value measurements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the fair value of impaired real estate assets that were determined using Level 3 inputs. 

Lease liabilities 
 
 Accounts payable and other liabilities 

The Company s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities primarily consist of a lease for the Company s corporate office space, which expires in October 2033. The lease contains two five-year extension options, exercisable at the Company s discretion, that are not reasonably certain to be exercised, and are therefore excluded from our calculation of the lease liability.

real estate properties, of which were leased under leases that have been classified as , that have been classified as direct financing leases, that has been classified as a sales-type lease, and three that were vacant. Of the nine leases classified as direct , include land portions which are accounted for as operating leases. The sales-type lease includes a land portion which is accounted for as an operating lease. Most leases have initial terms of to years. The Company s leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the Consumer Price Index CPI ), or increases in the tenant s sales volume. Generally, tenants are also required to pay all property taxes and assessments, substantially maintain the interior and exterior of the building, and maintain property and liability insurance coverage. The leases also typically provide for one or more multiple-year renewal options, at the election of the tenant, and are subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease.

Since lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the tenant, the above amounts only include future lease payments due during the initial lease terms. Such amounts exclude any potential variable rent increases that are based on changes in the CPI or future variable rents which may be received under the leases based on a percentage of the tenant s gross sales. Additionally, certain of our leases provide tenants with the option to terminate their leases in exchange for termination penalties, or that are contingent upon the occurrence of a future event. Future lease payments within the table above have not been adjusted for these termination rights. Investment in Rental Property Direct Financing Leases

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company issued target grants of of PRSUs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were no PRSUs issued. The awards are non-vested restricted stock units where the vesting percentages and the ultimate number of units vesting will be measured based on the relative total shareholder return rTSR of the Company s common stock as compared to the rTSR of peer companies, as identified in the grant agreements, over a three-year period, and based on the rTSR of the Company s common stock as compared to the rTSR of the MSCI US REIT Index over a three year measurement period. Vesting percentages range from to with a target of . rTSR means the percentage appreciation in the fair market value of one share over the measurement period beginning on the date of grant, assuming the reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date. The target number of units is based on achieving a rTSR equal to the th percentile of the peer companies and MSCI US REIT Index. For PRSUs issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that achieve a percentile rank of at least the th percentile, and the absolute rTSR of the Company is negative for the performance period, the awards will be reduced by , not to result in a reduction less than target. Dividends accrue during the measurement period and will be paid on the PRSUs ultimately earned at the end of the measurement period in either cash or common stock, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The grant date fair value of the PRSUs was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on assumptions including share price volatility.

million expected to fund in multiple draws through November 2024, using a combination of available cash on hand and unsecured revolving credit facility borrowings. Rent on this property commenced in September 2024 when the property reached substantial completion and was made available for use by the tenant. The Company is a party to two separate tax protection agreements with the contributing members of two distinct UPREIT transactions and a third tax protection agreement entered into in connection with the Company s internalization. The tax protection agreements require the Company to indemnify the beneficiaries in the event of a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposal of the contributed property, and in the case of the tax protection agreement entered into in connection with the Company s internalization, the entire Company, in a taxable transaction that would cause such beneficiaries to recognize a gain that is protected under the agreements, subject to certain exceptions. The Company is required to allocate an amount of nonrecourse liabilities to each beneficiary that is at least equal to the minimum liability amount, as contained in the agreements. The minimum liability amount and the associated allocation of nonrecourse liabilities are calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations, are completed at the OP level, and are not probable. Therefore, there is no impact to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on values as of September 30, 2024 , taxable sales of the applicable properties would trigger liability under the agreements of approximately million. Based on information available, the Company does not believe that the events resulting in damages as detailed above have occurred or are likely to occur in the foreseeable future. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various types of commitments to purchase real estate properties. These commitments are generally subject to the Company s customary due diligence process and, accordingly, a number of specific conditions must be met before the Company is obligated to purchase the properties.

Explanatory Note and Certain Defined Terms 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms and phrases are used throughout this MD A as described below: 
 annualized base rent or ABR means the annualized contractual cash rent due for the last month of the reporting period, excluding the impacts of short-term rent deferrals, abatements, or free rent, and adjusted to remove rent from properties sold during the month and to include a full month of contractual cash rent for investments made during the month; 

investments or amounts invested include real estate investments in new property acquisitions, revenue generating capital expenditures, whereby we agree to fund certain expenditures in exchange for increased rents that often include rent escalations and terms consistent with that of the underlying lease, development funding opportunities, and transitional capital, which represent shorter term investments and currently includes a preferred equity investment, and exclude capitalized costs; 

cash capitalization rate represents either (1) for acquisitions and new developments, the estimated first year cash yield to be generated on a real estate investment, which was estimated at the time of investment based on the contractually specified cash base rent for the first full year after the date of the investment, divided by the purchase price for the property excluding capitalized acquisitions costs, or (2) for dispositions, the estimated first year cash yield to be generated subsequent to disposition based on a property s ABR in effect immediately prior to the disposition, divided by the disposition price, or (3) for transitional capital, the contractual cash yield to be generated on total invested capital; 

CPI means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. City Average, All Items, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or other similar index which is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services; 

occupancy or a specified percentage of our portfolio that is occupied or leased means as of a specified date the quotient of (1) the total rentable square footage of our properties minus the square footage of our properties that are vacant and from which we are not receiving any rental payment, and (2) the total square footage of our properties; and 

Revolving Credit Facility means our 1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, dated January 28, 2022, with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. 

Overv iew 
 We are an industrial-focused, diversified net lease real estate investment trust REIT that invests in primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio includes 773 properties, with 766 properties located in 44 U.S. states and seven properties located in four Canadian provinces. 
 We focus on investing in real estate that is operated by creditworthy single tenants in industries characterized by positive business drivers and trends. We target properties that are an integral part of the tenants businesses and are therefore opportunities to secure long-term net leases through which our tenants are able to retain operational control of their strategically important locations, while allocating their debt and equity capital to fund core business operations rather than real estate ownership. 
 - Diversified Investment Strategy . We invest in real estate through property acquisitions, revenue generating capital expenditures, development funding opportunities, and transitional capital. Our investments in these alternatives fluctuate from time to time with macroeconomic conditions and business or market trends. Our strong relationships with brokers, developers, and tenants provides access to value-add, off-market and marketed investment opportunities. Off-market transactions are characterized by a lack of a formal marketing process and a lack of widely disseminated marketing materials. Marketed transactions are often characterized by extensive buyer competition. For all investments, we seek to maintain our portfolio s diversification by property type, geography, tenant, and industry in an effort to reduce fluctuations in income caused by under-performing individual real estate assets or adverse economic conditions affecting an entire industry or geographic region. 

24 

- Diversified Portfolio . As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio comprised approximately 39.7 million rentable square feet of operational space, was highly diversified based on property type, geography, tenant, and industry, and was cross-diversified within each e.g., property-type diversification within a geographic concentration): 

Property Type: We are diversified across industrial, restaurant, healthcare, retail, and office property types. Within these sectors, we have meaningful concentrations in manufacturing, distribution and warehouse, food processing, general merchandise, casual dining, and quick service restaurants. 

Geographic Diversification : Our properties are located in 44 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces, with no single geographic concentration exceeding 9.5 of our ABR. 

Tenant and Industry Diversification : Our properties are occupied by 203 different commercial tenants who operate 191 different brands that are diversified across 55 differing industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 4.0 of our ABR. 

- Strong In-Place Leases with Significant Remaining Lease Term . As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio was approximately 99.0 leased with an ABR weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10.3 years, excluding renewal options. 

- Standard Contractual Base Rent Escalation . Approximately 97.4 of our leases have contractual rent escalations, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.0 . 

- Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting . Approximately 94.0 of our tenants, based on ABR, provide financial reporting, of which 85.4 are required to provide us with specified financial information on a periodic basis, and an additional 8.6 of our tenants report financial statements publicly, either through SEC filings or otherwise. 

Current Macroeconomic Conditions and Strategic Priorities 
 Over the last two fiscal years, challenging macroeconomic conditions directly impacted the broader commercial real estate market and, in particular, the net lease real estate market. During the latter half of fiscal 2022, interest rates began to rise steadily and persisted through fiscal 2023, resulting in a challenging lending environment and a material increase in the cost of capital for commercial real estate buyers and lenders. The increase in interest rates accelerated at a more aggressive pace than commercial real estate capitalization rates, thereby compressing earnings on new investments. More recently, market expectations about expansionary monetary policy resulted in net lease real estate sellers maintaining higher pricing expectations, which ultimately led to a significant decrease in transaction volumes during the latter half of 2023 and into 2024. These challenging macroeconomic conditions have limited and may continue to limit the ability of commercial real estate owners, including us, to complete real estate acquisitions at volume and accretion levels consistent with prior years, resulting in lower earnings growth rates compared to historical periods. 
 Notwithstanding the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we believe that our portfolio performance and strong liquidity profile position our Company well for future opportunities. We expect to achieve growth in revenues and earnings through our four building blocks, including best-in-class portfolio rent escalations, revenue generating capital expenditures with existing tenants as a benefit from our industrial focus, development funding opportunities provided by the distressed lending environment, and a diversified acquisition pipeline. In addition, on February 21, 2024, we announced the strategic decision to sell our clinically-oriented healthcare properties as part of our healthcare portfolio simplification strategy with the near-term goal of reducing our healthcare ABR below 10 . Our decision to sell these assets was in part due to our review of our investment pipeline and expectation that we would fully redeploy the proceeds into our core investment verticals of industrial, retail, and restaurant assets without diluting our per share results. Through September 30, 2024, we have sold 43 healthcare properties for gross proceeds of 289.5 million. Subsequent to quarter-end, we sold an additional 10 healthcare properties for gross proceeds of 49.5 million, thereby completing nearly all planned healthcare dispositions for 2024 and reducing our healthcare ABR to less than 10 . We have successfully redeployed all sale proceeds from our healthcare portfolio simplification strategy and expect to employ a deliberate and methodical approach to repositioning our remaining clinically-oriented healthcare properties in order to enhance and preserve the value of those assets. 
 As a result of actual and planned sales from our healthcare portfolio simplification strategy, we have recognized a 72.5 million gain on sale of real estate and incurred 60.1 million of impairment charges through the date of this filing. Outside of gains on sale of real estate and impairments, we do not expect our healthcare portfolio simplification strategy to materially impact our results of operations or financial position.

Substantially all of our leases provide for periodic contractual rent escalations. As of September 30, 2024, leases contributing 97.4 of our ABR provided for increases in future ABR, generally ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 annually, with an ABR weighted average annual minimum increase equal to 2.0 of base rent. Generally, our rent escalators increase rent on specified dates by a fixed percentage. Our escalations provide us with a source of organic revenue growth and a measure of inflation protection. Additional information on lease escalation frequency and weighted average annual escalation rates as of September 30, 2024 is displayed below:

(a) Represents the ABR weighted average annual minimum increase of the entire portfolio as if all escalations occurred annually. For leases where rent escalates by the greater of a stated fixed percentage or the change in CPI, we have assumed an escalation equal to the stated fixed percentage in the lease. As of September 30, 2024, leases contributing 4.8 of our ABR provide for rent increases equal to the lesser of a stated fixed percentage or the change in CPI. As any future increase in CPI is unknowable at this time, we have not included an increase in the rent pursuant to these leases in the weighted average annual minimum increase presented. 

(b) Generally associated with investment grade retail tenants.

The escalation provisions of our leases (by percentage of ABR) as of September 30, 2024, are displayed in the following chart: 
 
 Transitional Capital 
 In addition to investing in new property acquisitions, revenue generating capital expenditures, and development fundings, we may, from time to time, invest in transitional capital opportunities, including preferred equity interests and real estate lending opportunities. Such investments are intended to be shorter in duration, capitalizing on the distressed lending environment.

The increase in Lease revenues, net, was primarily attributable to an increase in Other income from real estate transactions related to the settlement of a permanent land easement for an insignificant portion of two of our properties, an increase in reimbursable expenses, with a corresponding offset in Property and operating expenses, and an increase in contractual rent growth in our portfolio. Income from permanent land easements is infrequent in nature and not related to our core real estate operations.

Property and operating expense 
 The increase in property and operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to an increase in non-reimbursable property expenses related to a decrease in occupancy, along with an increase in reimbursable expenses that have a corresponding offset in Lease revenues, net. 
 General and administrative 
 The decrease in general and administrative was primarily due to a decrease in non-capitalized legal transaction costs related to our transitional capital investment transacted during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and a decrease in compensation expense resulting from an employee departure. 
 Provision for impairment of investment in rental properties 
 The amount of impairment recognized varies quarter-to-quarter based on individual facts and circumstances during the quarter. The following table presents the impairment charges for the respective periods:

The 1.1 million impairment charges during the third quarter of 2024 resulted from changes in our long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties. The impairments during the second and third quarters of 2024 primarily related to our strategic decision to sell our clinically-oriented healthcare properties as part of our healthcare portfolio simplification strategy. The timing and amount of impairment fluctuates from period to period depending on the specific facts and circumstances.

The increase in net income is primarily attributable to a 2.8 million decrease in the provision for impairment of investment in rental properties, a 2.5 million increase in lease revenues, net, and a 1.2 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by a 1.7 million increase in property and operating expenses and a 1.7 million decrease in other income (expenses). 
 GAAP net income includes items such as gain or loss on sale of real estate and provisions for impairment, among others, which can vary from quarter to quarter and impact period-over-period comparisons.

The decrease in Lease revenues, net was primarily attributable to a decrease in lease termination income (Other income from real estate transactions). Lease termination income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 7.5 million. There was no lease termination income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the decrease was due to a 5.9 million decrease in the amount of GAAP revenues recorded on a straight-line basis due to timing difference from first and second quarter dispositions and redeployment of those proceeds in the second and third quarter, an increase in write-off of accrued rental income of 2.5 million, an increase in adjustment to revenue recognized for uncollectible rental amounts of 3.4 million, and a decrease in contractual rental amounts billed of 1.0 million.

Depreciation and amortization 
 The decrease in depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to timing of dispositions during the first and second quarter of 2024 and the timing of redeployment into new properties during the second and third quarter of 2024. 
 Property and operating expense 
 The increase in property and operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in non-reimbursable expenses related to a decrease in occupancy. 
 General and administrative 
 The decrease in general and administrative for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in severance and employee transition costs, compensation costs, and insurance premiums.

Interest expense 
 The decrease in interest expense reflects a decrease in our weighted average cost of borrowings, relating to our variable-rate USD Revolving Credit Facility borrowings. At September 30, 2024, the overnight SOFR rate was 4.96 compared with the one-month SOFR rate of 5.32 at September 30, 2023. Additionally, we had a lower average outstanding balance of our variable rate debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine month ended September 30, 2023. The decreased total outstanding borrowings is primarily due to the use of proceeds from dispositions to pay down the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 36 

Gain on sale of real estate 
 Our recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain of 65.0 million on the sale of 46 properties, compared to a gain of 48.0 million on the sale of nine properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income (expenses) 
 The increase in other income (expenses) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 1.5 million foreign exchange gain recognized on the quarterly remeasurement of our 100 million Canadian Dollars CAD Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, compared to a 0.2 million unrealized foreign exchange loss recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in net income is primarily due to an increase in the provision for impairment of investment in rental properties of 29.8, a decrease in lease revenues, net of 18.2 million, and an increase in property and operating expenses of 1.4 million. These are offset by an increase in the gain on sale of real estate of 16.9 million, an increase in interest expense of 6.6 million, a decrease in depreciation and amortization of 6.2 million, a decrease in general and administrative expenses of 2.0 million, and an increase in other income (expenses) of 1.7 million. 
 GAAP net income includes items such as gain or loss on sale of real estate and provisions for impairment, among others, which can vary from quarter to quarter and impact period-over-period comparisons.

Liquidity and Cap ital Resources 
 General 
 We acquire real estate using a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our stockholders, and proceeds from dispositions of real estate properties. Our focus is on maximizing the risk-adjusted return to our stockholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity in our capital structure. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position. We believe our leverage strategy has allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost of debt while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet, as evidenced by our current investment grade credit ratings of BBB from S P and Baa2 from Moody s. We seek to maintain on a sustained basis a Leverage Ratio that is generally less than 6.0x. As of September 30, 2024, we had total debt outstanding of 2.0 billion, Net Debt of 1.9 billion, a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 5.0x, and a Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 4.9x. 
 Net Debt and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures, and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre is calculated based upon EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre, each of which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures below for further details concerning our calculation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measure. 
 Liquidity/REIT Requirements 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including our ongoing commitments to repay debt, fund our operations, acquire properties, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, on an annual basis. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances to meet our long-term liquidity needs, including repayment of debt and the acquisition of additional properties, from our annual taxable income. Instead, we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs primarily by relying upon external sources of capital and proceeds from selective property dispositions. 
 Short-term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt, to pay distributions, to fund our acquisitions that are under control or expected to close within a short time period, and to pay for commitments to fund development opportunities, tenant improvements, revenue generating capital expenditures, and transitional capital investments. Under leases where we are required to bear the cost of structural repairs and replacements, we do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property costs, including as a result of inflationary pressures in the current economic environment, because of the strong occupancy levels across our portfolio and the net lease nature of our leases. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from cash and cash equivalents balances and net cash provided by operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and capital recycled through selective property dispositions. We use cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to initially fund investments, which are subsequently repaid or replaced with proceeds from our equity and debt capital markets activities as well as proceeds from dispositions. 
 As detailed in the contractual obligations table below, we have approximately 175.2 million of expected obligations due throughout the remainder of 2024, primarily consisting of 99.1 million of commitments to fund investments, 57.2 million of dividends declared, 18.3 million of projected interest expense, and 0.6 million of mortgage amortization. We expect our cash provided by operating activities, as discussed below, will be sufficient to pay for our current obligations including interest and mortgage amortization. We expect to pay for commitments to fund investments and our dividends declared using our proceeds from dispositions and Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we have 874.5 million of available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Long-term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt and invest in additional revenue generating properties. We expect to source debt capital from unsecured term loans from commercial banks, revolving credit facilities, private placement senior unsecured notes, and public bond offerings. 
 The source and mix of our debt capital in the future will be impacted by market conditions as well as our continued focus on lengthening our debt maturity profile to better align with our portfolio s long-term leases, staggering debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of debt will mature in any single year in the future, and managing our exposure to interest rate risk. We have no material debt maturities until 2026, as detailed in the table below. 
 38 

We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, future debt and equity financings, and proceeds from limited sales of our properties. Our ability to access these capital sources may be impacted by unfavorable market conditions, particularly in the debt and equity capital markets, that are outside of our control. In addition, our success will depend on our operating performance, our borrowing restrictions, our degree of leverage, and other factors. Our acquisition growth strategy significantly depends on our ability to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by strengthening our balance sheet by investing in real estate with creditworthy tenants and lease guarantors, and by maintaining an appropriate mix of debt and equity capitalization. We also, from time to time, obtain or assume non-recourse mortgage financing from banks and insurance companies secured by mortgages on the corresponding specific property subject to limitations imposed by our Revolving Credit Facility covenants and our investment grade credit rating. 
 Equity Capital Resources 
 Our equity capital is primarily provided through our at-the-market common equity offering program ATM Program ), as well as follow-on equity offerings. During May 2024, we replaced our prior ATM Program with a new ATM Program with the same aggregate gross sales price of up to 400.0 million. Under the terms of our ATM Program we may, from time to time, publicly offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 400.0 million. The ATM Program provides for forward sale agreements, which enable us to set the price of shares upon pricing the offering, while delaying the issuance of shares and the receipt of the net proceeds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with forward sales agreements provided for under the ATM Program, we sold 2,187,700 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of 18.29 per share, subject to certain adjustments. We expect to settle the outstanding shares of these forward sales agreements before their maturities in August and September 2025. Our estimated net proceeds of these forward sale agreements is approximately 39.0 million as if they have been physically settled for cash as of September 30, 2024 . We have not settled any part of these forward sales agreements as of September 30, 2024. After considering the shares sold subject to forward sale agreements, we have 360.0 million of capacity remaining under the ATM Program as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our public offerings have been used to repay debt, fund acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes.

Debt Covenants 
 We are subject to various covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to our debt facilities, which are summarized below. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants on all outstanding borrowings. In the event of default, either through default on payments or breach of covenants, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders in excess of dividends required to maintain our REIT qualification. For each of the previous three years, we paid dividends out of our cash flows from operations in excess of the distribution amounts required to maintain our REIT qualification. 
 Contractual Obligations

(a) Our Revolving Credit Facility contains two six-month extension options subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625 of the revolving commitments. 

(b) Interest expense is projected based on the outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024. This amount includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements. 

(c) Amounts include dividends declared as of September 30, 2024 of 0.29 per common share and OP Unit. Future undeclared dividends have been excluded. 

(d) Amounts include acquisitions under control, defined as under contract or executed letter of intent, and commitments to fund revenue generating capital expenditures, and both current developments and under control development opportunities. 

At September 30, 2024 investment in rental property of 118.4 million was pledged as collateral against our mortgages. 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of commitments to purchase real estate properties. These commitments are generally subject to our customary due diligence process and, accordingly, a number of specific conditions must be met before we are obligated to purchase the properties. 
 40 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating-rate borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities. Borrowings pursuant to our unsecured credit facilities bear interest at floating rates based on SOFR or CORRA plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow. 
 We attempt to manage the interest rate risk on variable rate borrowings by entering into interest rate swaps. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into nine forward-starting interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of 460.0 million. These forward-starting swap arrangements are effective during various periods between March and December 2025 and mature in 2030. As of September 30, 2024, we had 32 effective and nine forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 1.43 billion. Under the effective swap agreements, we receive monthly payments from the counterparties equal to the related variable interest rates multiplied by the outstanding notional amounts. In turn, we pay the counterparties each month an amount equal to a fixed interest rate multiplied by the related outstanding notional amounts. The intended net impact of these transactions is that we pay a fixed interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings. The interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are reported at fair value. We assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of our qualifying cash flow hedges. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 In addition, we own investments in Canada, and as a result are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in the Canadian dollar, which may affect future costs and cash flows. We funded a significant portion of our Canadian investments through Canadian dollar borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is intended to act as a natural hedge against our Canadian dollar investments. The Canadian dollar Revolving Credit Facility borrowings are remeasured each reporting period, with the unrealized foreign currency gains and losses flowing through earnings. These unrealized foreign currency gains and losses do not impact our cash flows from operations until settled, and are expected to directly offset the changes in the value of our net investments as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar. Our Canadian investments are recorded at their historical exchange rates, and therefore are not impacted by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 11.2 million and 50.5 million at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The table below shows information concerning cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly due to a decrease in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was mainly due to increased investment volume, partially offset by an increase in disposition volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly reflects a decrease in net repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility and increased distributions paid to shareholders.

Non-GAAP M easures 
 FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO 
 We compute Funds From Operations FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit, the worldwide representative voice for REITs and publicly traded real estate companies with an interest in the U.S. real estate and capital markets. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. FFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains (losses) on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. 
 We compute Core Funds From Operations Core FFO by adjusting FFO, as defined by Nareit, to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that we believe are infrequently recurring, unusual in nature, or not related to its core real estate operations, including write-offs or recoveries of accrued rental income, lease termination fees and other non-core income from real estate transactions, cost of debt extinguishment, unrealized and realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, severance and employee transition costs, and other extraordinary items. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the equity REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a metric to assist in their evaluation of our operating performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of our peers, because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 
 We compute Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO ), by adjusting Core FFO for certain revenues and expenses that are non-cash or unique in nature, including straight-line rents, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, non-capitalized transaction costs such as acquisition costs related to deals that failed to transact, (gain) loss on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals, and is a factor in determining management compensation. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash revenues or expenses. 
 Specific to our adjustment for straight-line rents, our leases include cash rents that increase over the term of the lease to compensate us for anticipated increases in market rental rates over time. Our leases do not include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. 
 FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO with the same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful. 
 Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate Core FFO and AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of Core FFO and AFFO accordingly.

43 

EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre 
 We compute EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in our industry. We believe that this ratio provides investors and analysts with a measure of our performance that includes our operating results unaffected by the differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets compared to other companies in our industry. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by Nareit, as EBITDA excluding gains (losses) from the sales of depreciable property and provisions for impairment on investment in real estate. We believe EBITDA and EBITDAre are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information about our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 We are focused on a disciplined and targeted investment strategy, together with active asset management that includes selective sales of properties. We manage our leverage profile using a ratio of Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, and Pro Forma Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, each discussed further below, which we believe is a useful measure of our ability to repay debt and a relative measure of leverage, and is used in communications with our lenders and rating agencies regarding our credit rating. As we fund new investments using our unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, our leverage profile and Net Debt will be immediately impacted by current quarter investments. However, the full benefit of EBITDAre from new investments will not be received in the same quarter in which the properties are acquired. Additionally, EBITDAre for the quarter includes amounts generated by properties that have been sold during the quarter. Accordingly, the variability in EBITDAre caused by the timing of our investments and dispositions can temporarily distort our leverage ratios. We adjust EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre for the most recently completed quarter (i) to recalculate as if all investments and dispositions had occurred at the beginning of the quarter, (ii) to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that are either non-cash, such as cost of debt extinguishments, realized or unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, or gains on insurance recoveries, or that we believe are one time, or unusual in nature because they relate to unique circumstances or transactions that had not previously occurred and which we do not anticipate occurring in the future, and (iii) to eliminate the impact of lease termination fees and other items that are not a result of normal operations. While investments in property developments have an immediate impact to Net Debt, we do not make an adjustment to EBITDAre until the quarter in which the lease commences. We define our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre as Adjusted EBITDAre adjusted to show the impact of estimated contractual revenues based on in-process development spend to-date. Our Pro Forma Net Debt is defined as Net Debt adjusted for estimated net proceeds from forward sale agreements that have not settled as if they have been physically settled for cash as of the period presented. We then annualize quarterly Adjusted EBITDAre and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre by multiplying them by four Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre ). You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly different from our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are not measurements of performance under GAAP, and our Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP.

Net Debt, Net Debt to Annualized EBITDAre and Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre 
 We define Net Debt as gross debt (total reported debt plus debt issuance costs) less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. We believe that the presentation of Net Debt to Annualized EBITDAre and Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre is useful to investors and analysts because these ratios provide information about gross debt less cash and cash equivalents, which could be used to repay debt, compared to our performance as measured using EBITDAre, and is used in communications with lenders and rating agencies regarding our credit rating.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Impact of Recent Accou nting Pronouncements 
 For information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, one of the most predominant of which is a change in interest rates. Increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our Revolving Credit Facility and other variable-rate debt. Increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps mature. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by entering into long-term fixed rate debt, entering into interest rate swaps to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate, and staggering our debt maturities. We have designated the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and they are reported at fair value. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Further information concerning our interest rate swaps can be found in Note 9 in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our fixed-rate debt includes our senior unsecured notes, mortgages, and variable-rate debt converted to a fixed rate with the use of interest rate swaps. Our fixed-rate debt had a carrying value and fair value of approximately 1.9 billion and 1.8 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. Changes in market interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and interest rate swaps, but they have no impact on interest incurred or on cash flows. For instance, if interest rates were to increase and the fixed-rate debt balance were to remain constant, we would expect the fair value of our debt to decrease, similar to how the price of a bond decreases as interest rates rise. A 1 increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt of approximately 63.8 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Borrowings pursuant to our Revolving Credit Facility and other variable-rate debt bear interest at rates based on the applicable reference rate plus an applicable margin, and totaled 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. Taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps, a 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would have a corresponding 0.5 million increase or decrease in interest expense annually. 
 With the exception of our interest rate swap transactions, we have not engaged in transactions in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We own investments in Canada, and as a result are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in the Canadian dollar, which may affect future costs and cash flows. We funded a significant portion of our Canadian investments through Canadian dollar borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is intended to act as a natural hedge against our Canadian dollar investments. The Canadian dollar Revolving Credit Facility borrowings are remeasured each reporting period, with the unrealized foreign currency gains and losses flowing through earnings. A 10 increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and USD would have a corresponding 7.4 million increase or decrease in unrealized foreign currency gain or loss. These unrealized foreign currency gains and losses do not impact our cash flows from operations until settled, and are expected to directly offset the changes in the value of our net investments as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar. Our Canadian investments are recorded at their historical exchange rates, and therefore are not impacted by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. 
 Item 4.	Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 47 

Part II OTH ER INFORMATION

We are not aware of any material legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party or to which any of our property is subject, nor are we aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by government agencies.
