reverse split of its outstanding shares of common
stock in order to remain in compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement of Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurances
that the Company will be able to remain in compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement of Nasdaq over time. In addition,
Nasdaq has other continued listing requirements, one of which is maintaining a minimum net stockholders equity of . 

On
August 19, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that it was
not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholders Equity Rule ), which requires the Company
to maintain a minimum stockholders equity of . This notice of non-compliance has no immediate impact on the continued
listing or trading of the Company s securities on Nasdaq, which will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, subject to the
Company s compliance with the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. 

On
October 3, 2024, the Company submitted a letter to Nasdaq with its plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule,
which outlined the Company s proposed initiatives to regain compliance by raising equity capital through various registered equity
offerings. 

On
October 21, 2024, Nasdaq provided the Company notice that it had granted an extension through February 18, 2025 for the Company to regain
compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule. The Company must complete its capital raising initiatives and evidence compliance
with the Stockholders Equity Rule through filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC providing certain required information
by February 18, 2025. 

If
the Company fails to evidence compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule upon filing its periodic report for the quarter ending
March 31, 2025 with the SEC, the Company may be subject to delisting. If Nasdaq determines to delist the Company s common stock,
the Company will have the right to appeal to a Nasdaq hearings panel. The hearing request would stay any suspension or delisting action
pending the conclusion of the hearing process. 

The
Company intends to take reasonable measures available to regain compliance under Nasdaq s listing rules and to remain listed on
Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule,
or be able to maintain compliance with all other applicable requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. If the Company does not regain
compliance with Nasdaq s listing rules within the time period permitted by Nasdaq, then the Company s securities will be
delisted from Nasdaq. 

Going
Concern 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of and used cash in operations of . At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of available to fund its operations. Because the Company is currently engaged in
various early-stage clinical trials, it is expected that it will take a significant amount of time and resources to develop any product
or intellectual property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company s business is unlikely to generate
any sustainable operating revenues in the next several years and may never do so. Even if the Company is able to generate revenues through
licensing its technology, product sales or other commercial activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve
and maintain positive earnings and operating cash flows. At September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining financial contractual commitments
pursuant to clinical trial agreements and clinical trial monitoring agreements not yet incurred aggregated approximately (see
Note 8), which are currently scheduled to be incurred through approximately December 31, 2027. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements also
do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern. The Company has no recurring source of revenues and has experienced negative operating cash flows since
inception. The Company has financed its working capital requirements through the recurring sale of its equity securities. 

Based
on the foregoing, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are being issued. In addition, our independent registered public
accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report with respect to this uncertainty that accompanies our audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its research
and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The amount and timing of future
cash requirements depends on the pace, design, and results of the Company s clinical trial program, which, in turn, depends on
the availability of operating capital to fund such activities. 

Based
on current operating plans, the Company estimates that its existing cash resources at September 30, 2024 will provide sufficient working
capital to fund the current clinical trial program with respect to the development of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound,
LB-100, through the first quarter of 2025. As existing cash resources will not be sufficient to complete the clinical development of,
and obtain regulatory approval for, the Company s product candidate, the Company will need to raise additional capital in one or
more tranches to fund its operations during the next few months in order to be able to effectively manage its current business plan during
2025 and thereafter, as well as to maintain its listing on Nasdaq. Furthermore, the Company s operating plans and capital requirements
may change as a result of many factors that are currently unknown and/or outside of the control of the Company. The Company is considering
various strategies and alternatives to obtain the required additional capital. 

As
market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary, to continue to conduct operations. 

If
cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company would be required to scale back
or discontinue its clinical trial program, or obtain funds, if available, through strategic alliances or joint ventures that could require
the Company to relinquish rights to and/or control of LB-100, or to discontinue operations entirely.

The
Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law under a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed by GAAP. The
tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the taxing authority as
of the reporting date. If the tax position is not considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained, then no benefits of
the position are recognized. The Company had not recorded any liability for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 or December
31, 2023. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a component
of income tax expense.

Level
3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data for the asset or liability which requires the reporting entity to develop
its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently traded non-exchange-based derivatives
and commingled investment funds and are measured using present value pricing models. 

The
Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company
performs an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.

directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions, consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination
with another person or group, whereby such other person or group acquires more than 50 of the voting power of the common equity of the
Company. 

If
such fundamental transaction is not within the Company s control, including not being approved by the Company s Board of
Directors, the warrant holder would only be entitled to receive the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion) equal
to the Black-Scholes valuation amount of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant on the date of consummation of such fundamental
transaction as the holders of the Company s common stock receive. Accordingly, these warrants are classified as a component of
permanent stockholders equity. The Company will account for any cash payment for a warrant redemption as a distribution from stockholders 
equity, as and when a fundamental transaction is consummated and such cash payment is required to be made.

 basis, that were issued as part of the Company s November 2020 public offering of units, and are exercisable for a period
of five years thereafter. As a result of the 1-for-10 reverse split of the Company s common stock effective June 2, 2023, each
such publicly-traded warrant currently now represents the right to purchase 1/10th of a share of common stock at the original exercise
price of per share. Accordingly, the exercise of 10 warrants, each exercisable at , are required to acquire one share of post-split
common stock, which is equivalent to a purchase price of per share.

The
fair value of a stock option award is calculated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The risk-free interest
rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the
Company s expectation of dividend payouts and is assumed to be zero. The estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility
of the Company s common stock, calculated utilizing a look-back period approximately equal to the contractual life of the stock
option being granted. Unless sufficient historical exercise data is available, the expected life of the stock option is calculated as
the mid-point between the vesting period and the contractual term (the simplified method ). The fair market value of the
common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the common stock on the grant date.

Netherlands
Cancer Institute. Effective June 10, 2024, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the Netherlands Cancer Institute NKI (see Note 5) to conduct a Phase 1b clinical trial of the Company s protein phosphatase inhibitor, LB-100, combined
with atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, the proprietary molecule of F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. Roche ), for patients with microsatellite
stable metastatic colon cancer. Under the agreement, the Company will provide its lead compound, LB-100, and under a separate agreement
between NKI and Roche, Roche will provide atezolizumab and financial support for the clinical trial. The Company has no obligation to
and will not provide any reimbursement of clinical trial costs. Pursuant to the agreement and the protocol set forth in the agreement,
the clinical trial will be conducted by NKI at NKI s site in Amsterdam by principal investigator Neeltje Steeghs, MD, PhD, and
NKI will be responsible for the recruitment of patients. The agreement provides for the protection of the respective intellectual property
rights of each of the Company, NKI and Roche. 

This
Phase 1b clinical trial will evaluate safety, optimal dose and preliminary efficacy of LB-100 combined with atezolizumab for the treatment
of patients with metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer. Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies like atezolizumab can
enhance the body s immune response against cancer and hinder tumor growth and spread. LB-100 has been found to improve the effectiveness
of anticancer drugs in killing cancer cells by inhibiting a protein called PP2A on cell surfaces. Blocking PP2A increases stress signals
in tumor cells expressing the PP2A protein. Accordingly, combining atezolizumab with LB-100 may enhance treatment efficacy for metastatic
colorectal cancer, as cancer cells with heightened stress signals are more vulnerable to immunotherapy. 

This
study comprises a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The objective of the dose escalation phase is to determine the recommended
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LB-100 when combined with the standard dosage of atezolizumab. The dose expansion phase will further investigate
the preliminary efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/dynamics of the LB-100 and atezolizumab combination. The clinical
trial opened in August 2024 with the enrollment of the first patient. Patient accrual is expected to take up to 24 months, with a maximum
of 37 patients with advanced colorectal cancer to be enrolled in this study. 

The
principal investigator of the colorectal study testing LB-100 in combination with atezolizumab is currently investigating two Serious
Adverse Events SAEs observed in the clinical trial. Evaluation is underway to determine next steps (see Serious
Adverse Events below for additional information). 

The
Company has no financial contractual commitment associated with this clinical trial. 

City
of Hope. Effective January 18, 2021, the Company executed a Clinical Research Support Agreement (the Agreement with
the City of Hope National Medical Center, an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and City of Hope Medical Foundation (collectively,
 City of Hope ), to carry out a Phase 1b clinical trial of LB-100, the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase
inhibitor, combined with an FDA-approved standard regimen for treatment of untreated extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer ED-SCLC ).
LB-100 was given in combination with carboplatin, etoposide and atezolizumab, an FDA-approved standard of care regimen, to previously
untreated ED-SCLC patients. The LB-100 dose was to be escalated with the standard fixed doses of the 3-drug regimen to reach a recommended
Phase 2 dose RP2D ). Patient entry was to be expanded so that a total of 12 patients would be evaluable at the RP2D to
confirm the safety of the LB-100 combination and to look for potential therapeutic activity as assessed by objective response rate, duration
of overall response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. 

The
clinical trial was initiated on March 9, 2021, with patient accrual expected to take approximately two years to complete. Because patient
accrual was slower than expected, effective March 6, 2023, the Company and City of Hope added the Sarah Cannon Research Institute SCRI ),
Nashville, Tennessee, to the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial. The Company and City of Hope continued efforts to increase patient accrual
by adding additional sites and by modifying the protocol to increase the number of patients eligible for the clinical trial. The impact
of these efforts to increase patient accrual and to decrease time to completion was evaluated in subsequent quarters. 

After
evaluating patient accrual through June 30, 2024, the Company and City of Hope agreed to close the clinical trial. Pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement, the Company provided notice to City of Hope of the Company s intent to terminate the Agreement effective as of
July 8, 2024. Upon closure, the Company incurred a prorated charge of for the cost of patients enrolled to date. The Company
is exploring alternative sites, including international locations, for the conduct of a small cell lung cancer clinical trial. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of and , respectively, pursuant to this Agreement.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of and , respectively, pursuant
to this Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, total costs of had been incurred pursuant to this Agreement. 

GEIS.
 Effective July 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement for an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial with the
Spanish Sarcoma Group (Grupo Espa ol de Investigaci n en Sarcomas or GEIS ), Madrid, Spain, to carry out a
study entitled Randomized phase I/II trial of LB-100 plus doxorubicin vs. doxorubicin alone in first line of advanced soft tissue
sarcoma . The purpose of this clinical trial is to obtain information with respect to the efficacy and safety of LB-100 combined
with doxorubicin in soft tissue sarcomas. Doxorubicin is the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas ASTS ).
Doxorubicin alone has been the mainstay of first line treatment of ASTS for over 40 years, with little improvement in survival from adding
cytotoxic compounds to or substituting other cytotoxic compounds for doxorubicin. In animal models, LB-100 consistently enhances the
anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin without apparent increases in toxicity. 

GEIS
has a network of referral centers in Spain and across Europe that have an impressive track record of efficiently conducting innovative
studies in ASTS. The Company agreed to provide GEIS with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the conduct of this clinical trial, as
well as to provide funding for the clinical trial. The goal is to enter approximately 150 to 170 patients in this clinical trial over
a period of two to four years. The Phase 1 portion of the study began in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 to determine the recommended
Phase 2 dose of the combination of doxorubicin and LB-100. As advanced sarcoma is a very aggressive disease, the design of the Phase
2 portion of the study assumes a median progression-free survival PFS ), no evidence of disease progression or death from
any cause, of 4.5 months in the doxorubicin arm and an alternative median PFS of 7.5 months in the doxorubicin plus LB-100 arm to demonstrate
a statistically significant decrease in relative risk of progression or death by adding LB-100. There is a planned interim analysis of
the primary endpoint when approximately 50 of the 102 events required for final analysis is reached. 

The
Company had previously expected that this clinical trial would commence during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. However, during July
2020, the Spanish regulatory authority advised the Company that although it had approved the scientific and ethical basis of the protocol,
it required that the Company manufacture new inventory of LB-100 under current Spanish pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. These
standards were adopted subsequent to the production of the Company s existing LB-100 inventory. 

In
order to manufacture a new inventory supply of LB-100 for the GEIS clinical trial, the Company engaged a number of vendors to carry out
the multiple tasks needed to make and gain approval of a new clinical product for investigational study in Spain. These tasks included
the synthesis under good manufacturing practice (GMP) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), with documentation of each of the
steps involved by an independent auditor. The API was then transferred to a vendor that prepares the clinical drug product, also under
GMP conditions documented by an independent auditor. The clinical drug product was then sent to a vendor to test for purity and sterility,
provide appropriate labels, store the drug, and distribute the drug to the clinical centers for use in the clinical trials. A formal
application documenting all steps taken to prepare the clinical drug product for clinical use was submitted to the appropriate regulatory
authorities for review and approval before being used in a clinical trial. 

As
of December 31, 2023, this program to provide new inventory of the clinical drug product for the Spanish Sarcoma Group study, and potentially
for subsequent multiple trials within the European Union, had cost approximately . 

On
October 13, 2022, the Company announced that the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (Agencia Espa ola de Medicamentos
y Productos Sanitarios or AEMPS had authorized a Phase 1b/randomized Phase 2 study of LB-100, the Company s lead
clinical compound, plus doxorubicin, versus doxorubicin alone, the global standard for initial treatment of ASTS. Consequently, this
clinical trial commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and is expected to be completed and a report prepared by December 31,
2026. In April 2023, GEIS completed its first site initiation visit in preparation for the clinical trial at Fundaci n Jim nez
D az University Hospital (Madrid). Up to 170 patents will be entered into the clinical trial. The recruitment for the Phase 1b
portion of the protocol was extended with two patients and was completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects
to have data on toxicity and preliminary efficacy from this portion of the clinical trial by December 31, 2024, and a full report by
June 30, 2025. Subject to clinical results and the availability of sufficient working capital resources, the Company anticipates that
it will then be in a position to decide whether to proceed to the related Phase 2 portion of the study. 

The
interim analysis of the Phase 2 portion of this clinical trial will be done before full accrual of patients is completed to determine
whether the study has the possibility of showing superiority of the combination of LB-100 plus doxorubicin compared to doxorubicin alone.
A positive study would have the potential to change the standard therapy for this disease after four decades of failure to improve the
marginal benefit of doxorubicin alone. 

The
Company s agreement with GEIS provides for various payments based on achieving specific milestones over the term of the agreement.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any costs pursuant to this agreement. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of and , respectively, pursuant to this agreement.
Through September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred charges of for work done under this agreement through the fourth milestone. 

The
Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 
(consisting of for the Phase 1b portion and for the Phase 2 portion) as of September 30, 2024, which is scheduled
to be incurred through December 31, 2027. As the work is being conducted in Europe and is paid for in Euros, final costs are subject
to foreign currency fluctuations between the United States Dollar and the Euro. Such fluctuations are recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as foreign currency gain or loss, as appropriate, and have not been significant. 

MD
Anderson Cancer Center Clinical Trial . On September 20, 2023, the Company announced an investigator-initiated Phase 1b/2 collaborative
clinical trial to assess whether adding LB-100 to a human programmed death receptor-1 PD-1 blocking antibody of GSK plc GSK ), dostarlimab-gxly, may enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy in the treatment of ovarian clear cell carcinoma OCCC ). The study objective is to determine the overall survival OS of patients with OCCC. The clinical
trial is being sponsored by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center MD Anderson and is being conducted at The
University of Texas - MD Anderson Cancer Center. The Company is providing LB-100 and GSK is providing dostarlimab-gxly and financial
support for the clinical trial. On January 29, 2024, the Company announced the entry of the first patient into this clinical trial. The
Company currently expects that this clinical trial will be completed by December 31, 2027. 

Moffitt.
 Effective August 20, 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Research Agreement with the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research
Institute Hospital Inc., Tampa, Florida Moffitt ), effective for a term of five years. Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Research
Agreement, Moffitt agreed to conduct and manage a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the toxicity and therapeutic benefit of the Company s
lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 to be administered intravenously in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic
syndrome MDS ). 

In
November 2018, the Company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Investigational New Drug IND Application to conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the toxicity and therapeutic benefit of LB-100 in patients with low and
intermediate-1 risk MDS who had failed or were intolerant of standard treatment. This Phase 1b/2 clinical trial utilized LB-100 as a
single agent in the treatment of patients with low and intermediate-1 risk MDS. 

The
clinical trial began at a single site in April 2019 and the first patient was entered into the clinical trial in July 2019. During the
year ended December 31, 2023, the clinical trial was closed. Although the maximum tolerated dose MTD was not achieved,
there was no dose-limiting toxicity noted. 

During
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any costs pursuant to this agreement. As
of September 30, 2024, total costs of had been incurred pursuant to this agreement. 

During
September 2023, the Company decided not to pursue further studies in MDS, as other, more promising, opportunities had become available
(see Patent and License Agreements - Moffitt below). 

National
Cancer Institute Pharmacologic Clinical Trial. In May 2019, the National Cancer Institute NCI initiated a glioblastoma GBM pharmacologic clinical trial. This study was being conducted and funded by the NCI under a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement, with the Company responsible for providing the LB-100 clinical compound. The NCI study was designed to determine
the extent to which LB-100 enters recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients having surgery to remove one or more tumors received one dose
of LB-100 prior to surgery and had blood and tumor tissue analyzed to determine the amount of LB-100 present and to determine whether
the cells in the tumors showed the biochemical changes expected to be present if LB-100 reached its molecular target. As a result of
the innovative design of the NCI study, it was believed that data from a few patients would be sufficient to provide a sound rationale
for conducting a larger clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of adding LB-100 to the standard treatment regimen for GBMs. Blood
and brain tumor tissue were analyzed from seven patients after intravenous infusion of a single dose of LB-100. Results of the investigation
demonstrated that there was virtually no entry of LB-100 into the brain tumor tissue. Accordingly, alternative methods of drug delivery
will be required to determine if LB-100 has meaningful clinical anti-cancer activity against glioblastoma multiforme and other aggressive
brain tumors. The Company is considering an additional clinical study to address the delivery of LB-100 to the brain.

The
Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this contract, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately

Specific
Risks Associated with the Company s Business Activities 

Serious
Adverse Events 

The
Company s lead drug candidate, LB-100, is currently undergoing various clinical trials, and there is a risk that one or more of
these trials could be placed on hold by regulatory authorities due to serious adverse events (SAEs) related to our drug candidate or
to another company s drug used in combination in one of our clinical trials. It is possible that the SAEs could be attributable
to our drug candidate and could include, but not be limited to, unexpected severe side effects, treatment-related deaths, or long-term
health complications. A dose given could result in non-tolerable adverse events defined as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). When two DLTs
occur at the same dose-level that dose-level is considered too high and unsafe. Further treatment is only allowed at lower dose-levels
that have previously been found safe. 

If
an SAE or a pattern of SAEs is observed during the course of a clinical trial involving our drug candidate, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), or other regulatory authorities may issue a clinical hold, requiring us to pause or discontinue
further enrollment and dosing in our clinical trial. It is also possible that the clinical trial could be terminated. Any of these actions
could delay or halt the development of our drug candidate, increase development costs, and negatively impact our ability to ultimately
achieve regulatory approval. Additionally, if an SAE is confirmed to be drug-related, we may be required to conduct additional studies,
modify the study design, or abandon further development of the drug candidate altogether, which could materially impact our business,
financial condition, and prospects. 

The
occurrence of an SAE and any resulting clinical hold could also harm our reputation with patients, physicians, health institutions, and
investors, diminish our ability to attract clinical trial participants, and damage our ability to interest investors and obtain financing
in the future. There can be no assurance that we will not experience such SAEs in the future or that any related clinical hold will be
lifted in a timely manner, or at all. 

The
principal investigator of the colorectal study testing LB-100 in combination with atezolizumab (Roche PD-L1 inhibitor) is currently investigating
two SAEs observed in the clinical trial that was launched in August 2024. Evaluation is underway to determine next steps. 

Other
Business Risks 

Covid-19
Virus . The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in early 2020 led to disruptions in general economic activities throughout
the world as businesses and governments implemented broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. Although the Covid-19 outbreak
has subsided, the extent to which the coronavirus or any other pandemics may reappear and impact the Company s clinical trial programs
and capital raising efforts in the future is uncertain and cannot be predicted. 

Inflation
and Interest Rate Risk. The Company does not believe that inflation or increasing interest rates has had a material effect on its
operations to date, other than its impact on the general economy. However, there is a risk that the Company s operating costs could
become subject to inflationary and interest rate pressures in the future, which would have the effect of increasing the Company s
operating costs (including, specifically, clinical trial costs), and which would put additional stress on the Company s working
capital resources. 

Supply
Chain Issues. The Company does not currently expect that supply chain issues will have a significant impact on its business activities,
including its ongoing clinical trials. 

Potential
Recession. There are some indications that the United States economy may be at risk of entering a recessionary period. Although unclear
at this time, an economic recession would likely impact the general business environment and the capital markets, which could, in turn,
affect the Company. 

Geopolitical
Risk. The geopolitical landscape poses inherent risks that could significantly impact the operations and financial performance of
the Company. In the event of a military conflict, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical uncertainties, and economic repercussions may
adversely affect the Company s ability to conduct research, develop, test and manufacture products, and distribute them globally.
This could lead to delays in product development, interruptions in the supply of critical materials, and delays in clinical trials, thereby
impeding the Company s clinical development and commercialization plans. Furthermore, the impact of a conflict on global financial
markets may result in increased volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, thereby affecting the valuation of the Company s
publicly-traded shares. Investor confidence, market sentiment, and access to capital may all be negatively influenced. Such geopolitical
risks are outside the control of the Company, and the actual effects on the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations may differ from current estimates. 

Cybersecurity
Risks. The Company has established policies and processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risk from cybersecurity
threats, and has integrated these processes into its overall risk management systems and processes. The Company routinely assesses material
risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through its information and email systems
that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the Company s information and email systems
or any information residing therein. The Company conducts periodic risk assessments to identify cybersecurity threats, as well as assessments
in the event of a material change in the Company s business practices that may affect information systems that are vulnerable to
such cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, the
likelihood and potential damage that could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems and
safeguards in place to manage such risks. The Company has not encountered any cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired
its operations or financial condition. Additional information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats is provided in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

The
Company is continuing to monitor these matters and will adjust its current business and financing plans as more information and guidance
become available.

Overview 

The
Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying new targets for cancer drug development and developing and
commercializing cancer therapies. The Company s corporate office is located in Pasadena, California. 

The
Company s product pipeline is primarily focused on inhibitors of Protein Phosphatase 2A, which is used to enhance cytotoxic agents,
radiation, immune checkpoint blockers and other cancer therapies. The Company believes that inhibitors of protein phosphatases have significant
therapeutic potential for a broad range of cancers. The Company is focusing on the clinical development of a specific protein phosphatase
inhibitor, referred to as LB-100, which has been shown to have clinical anti-cancer activity at doses that produce little or no toxicity. 

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital. The Company
has not yet commenced any revenue-generating operations, does not have positive cash flows from operations, relies on stock-based compensation
for a substantial portion of employee and consultant compensation, and is dependent on periodic infusions of equity capital to fund its
operating requirements. 

Recent
Developments 

On
September 4, 2024, the Company announced it had received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
for U.S. Patent application number 16/467,721, titled, Oxabicycloheptanes for Modulation of Immune Response, for combining
the Company s lead compound, LB-100, with various innovative cancer immunotherapies. 

Going
Concern 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of 2,968,271 and used cash in operations of 2,565,861. At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 1,637,627 available to fund its operations. Because the Company is currently engaged in
various early-stage clinical trials, it is expected that it will take a significant amount of time and resources to develop any product
or intellectual property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company s business is unlikely to generate
any sustainable operating revenues in the next several years and may never do so. Even if the Company is able to generate revenues through
licensing its technology, product sales or other commercial activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve
and maintain positive earnings and operating cash flows. At September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining financial contractual commitments
pursuant to clinical trial agreements and clinical trial monitoring agreements not yet incurred aggregated approximately 3,918,000,
which are currently scheduled to be incurred through approximately December 31, 2027. 

36 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements also
do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern. The Company has no recurring source of revenues and has experienced negative operating cash flows since
inception. The Company has financed its working capital requirements through the recurring sale of its equity securities. 

Based
on the foregoing, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are being issued. In addition, our independent registered public
accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in their report with respect to this uncertainty that accompanies our audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its research
and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The amount and timing of future
cash requirements depends on the pace, design, and results of the Company s clinical trial program, which, in turn, depends on
the availability of operating capital to fund such activities. 

Based
on current operating plans, the Company estimates that its existing cash resources at September 30, 2024 will provide sufficient working
capital to fund the current clinical trial program with respect to the development of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound,
LB-100, through the first quarter of 2025. As existing cash resources will not be sufficient to complete the clinical development of,
and obtain regulatory approval for, the Company s product candidate, the Company will need to raise additional capital in one or
more tranches to fund its operations during the next few months in order to be able to effectively manage its current business plan during
2025 and thereafter, as well as to maintain its listing on Nasdaq. Furthermore, the Company s operating plans and capital requirements
may change as a result of many factors that are currently unknown and/or outside of the control of the Company. The Company is considering
various strategies and alternatives to obtain the required additional capital. 

As
market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, as and when necessary, to continue to conduct operations. 

If
cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company would be required to scale back
or discontinue its clinical trial program, or obtain funds, if available, through strategic alliances or joint ventures that could require
the Company to relinquish rights to and/or control of LB-100, or to discontinue operations entirely. 

Nasdaq
Compliance 

The
Company s common stock and the warrants are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq under the symbols LIXT 
and LIXTW , respectively. On June 2, 2023, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse split of its outstanding shares of common
stock in order to remain in compliance with the 1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement of Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurances
that the Company will be able to remain in compliance with the 1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement of Nasdaq over time. In addition,
Nasdaq has other continued listing requirements, one of which is maintaining a minimum net stockholders equity of 2,500,000. 

On
August 19, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that it was
not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Stockholders Equity Rule ), which requires the Company
to maintain a minimum stockholders equity of 2,500,000. This notice of non-compliance has no immediate impact on the continued
listing or trading of the Company s securities on Nasdaq, which will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, subject to the
Company s compliance with the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements. 

37 

On
October 3, 2024, the Company submitted a letter to Nasdaq with its plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule,
which outlined the Company s proposed initiatives to regain compliance by raising equity capital through various registered equity
offerings. 

On
October 21, 2024, Nasdaq provided the Company notice that it had granted an extension through February 18, 2025 for the Company to regain
compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule. The Company must complete its capital raising initiatives and evidence compliance
with the Stockholders Equity Rule through filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC providing certain required information
by February 18, 2025. 

If
the Company fails to evidence compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule upon filing its periodic report for the quarter ending
March 31, 2025 with the SEC, the Company may be subject to delisting. If Nasdaq determines to delist the Company s common stock,
the Company will have the right to appeal to a Nasdaq hearings panel. The hearing request would stay any suspension or delisting action
pending the conclusion of the hearing process. 

The
Company intends to take reasonable measures available to regain compliance under Nasdaq s listing rules and to remain listed on
Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity Rule,
or be able to maintain compliance with all other applicable requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. If the Company does not regain
compliance with Nasdaq s listing rules within the time period permitted by Nasdaq, then the Company s securities will be
delisted from Nasdaq. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Information
with respect to recent accounting pronouncements is provided at Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included elsewhere in this document. 

Concentration
of Risk 

Information
with respect to concentration of risk is provided at Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included elsewhere in this document. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken, as a whole, under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes
in facts and circumstances, historical experience, and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates
are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to assumptions
used in the calculation of accruals for clinical trial costs and other potential liabilities, and valuing equity instruments issued for
services. 

The
following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

Cash 

Cash
is held in a cash bank deposit program maintained by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, a division of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC Morgan Stanley ). Morgan Stanley is a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer. The Company s policy is to maintain its cash
balances with financial institutions in the United States with high credit ratings and in accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the FDIC and/or by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the SIPC ). The Company periodically
has cash balances in financial institutions in excess of the FDIC and SIPC insurance limits of 250,000 and 500,000, respectively. Morgan
Stanley Wealth Management also maintains supplemental insurance coverage for the cash balances of its customers. The Company has not
experienced any losses to date resulting from this policy. 

38 

Segment
Information 

The
Company operates and reports in one segment, which consisted of the development of a drug class called Protein Phosphatase 2A inhibitors.
The Company s operating segment is reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Company s
Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer. 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants and contractors, and other expenses relating to the negotiation,
design, development, conduct and management of clinical trials with respect to the Company s clinical compound and product candidate.
Research and development costs also include the costs to manufacture compounds used in research and clinical trials, which are charged
to operations as incurred. The Company s inventory of LB-100 for clinical use has been manufactured separately in the United States
and in the European Union in accordance with the laws and regulations of such jurisdictions. 

Research
and development costs are generally charged to operations ratably over the life of the underlying contracts, unless the achievement of
milestones, the completion of contracted work, the termination of an agreement, or other information indicates that a different expensing
schedule is more appropriate. However, payments for research and development costs that are contractually defined as non-refundable are
charged to operations as incurred. 

Obligations
incurred with respect to mandatory scheduled payments under agreements with milestone provisions are recognized as charges to research
and development costs in the Company s consolidated statement of operations based on the achievement of such milestones, as specified
in the respective agreement. Obligations incurred with respect to mandatory scheduled payments under agreements without milestone provisions
are accounted for when due, are recognized ratably over the appropriate period, as specified in the respective agreement, and are recorded
as liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the
Company s consolidated statement of operations. 

Payments
made pursuant to contracts are initially recorded as advances on research and development contract services in the Company s consolidated
balance sheet and are then charged to research and development costs in the Company s consolidated statement of operations as those
contract services are performed. Expenses incurred under contracts in excess of amounts advanced are recorded as research and development
contract liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs
in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. The Company reviews the status of its various clinical trial and research
and development contracts on a quarterly basis. 

Patent
and Licensing Legal and Filing Fees and Costs 

Due
to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on the Company s
research efforts and related patent applications, all patent and licensing legal and filing fees and costs are charged to operations
as incurred. Patent and licensing legal and filing fees and costs are included in general and administrative costs in the Company s
consolidated statements of operations. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, patent and licensing legal and filing fees and costs related to the development and
protection of its intellectual property were 45,416 and 178,012, respectively, a decrease of 132,596, or 74.5 , in 2024 as compared
to 2023. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, patent and licensing legal and filing fees and costs related to the development and
protection of its intellectual property were 192,239 and 835,362, respectively, a decrease of 643,123, or 77.0 , in 2024 as compared
to 2023. 

In
September 2023, the Company appointed a new President and Chief Executive Officer, who, with the assistance of the Company s management,
Board of Directors and patent legal counsel, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Company s extensive patent portfolio in
order to implement a program to balance patent prosecution costs with intellectual property protection benefits. As a result, the Company
identified certain patent filings that it does not intend to continue to support in 2024 and thereafter. In addition, effective July
1, 2024, the Company changed its intellectual property law firm. The Company expects that patent and licensing legal and filing fees
and costs will continue to be a significant continuing cost in 2024 and thereafter as the Company continues to develop and expand its
patent portfolio related to the clinical development of LB-100. 

39 

A
descriptive summary of the patent portfolio for the Company s most important clinical programs involving the development of LB-100,
as well as a detailed listing of each domestic and international patent that has been issued, is presented at ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Intellectual Property in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors, employees, Scientific Advisory Committee members,
contractors and consultants for services rendered. Options vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each
grant. Stock grants, which are generally time vested, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations ratably over
the vesting period. 

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers, directors, employees, Scientific Advisory Committee members, contractors, and
consultants by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for equity awards utilizing the grant date fair value of the awards,
with the cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis in the Company s financial statements over the vesting
period of the awards. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company had paid
cash for the services. 

The
fair value of stock options granted as stock-based compensation is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is
affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the expected life of the stock option, the exercise price of the stock
option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock.
Unless sufficient historical exercise data is available, the expected life of the stock option is calculated as the mid-point between
the vesting period and the contractual term (the simplified method ). The estimated volatility is based on the historical
volatility of the Company s common stock, calculated utilizing a look-back period approximately equal to the contractual life of
the stock option being granted. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The fair market value of the common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company s common stock on
the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company s expectation of dividend payouts and is assumed to be zero. 

The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in general and administrative costs and in research and development
costs, as appropriate, in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company issues new shares of common stock to
satisfy stock option exercises. 

Warrants 

The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity ASC 480 ), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the
warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether
the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the
Company s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance
outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. The Company has determined that the warrants
issued in the July 20, 2023 equity financing meet the requirements for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use
of professional judgment, is conducted when the warrants are issued and at the end each subsequent quarterly period while the warrants
are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to
be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all
of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be liability classified and recorded at their initial fair value
on the date of issuance and remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the
warrants that are liability classified are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss in the statement of operations.

Summary
of Business Activities and Plans 

Company
Overview 

The
Company is focusing its development activities on its lead compound LB-100. The Company believes that the mechanism by which LB-100 affects
cancer cell growth is different from cancer agents currently approved for clinical use. LB-100 is currently being tested in clinical
trials in Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma, Metastatic Micro Satellite Stable (MSS) Colon Cancer and Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma. LB-100
has shown anti-cancer activity in animal models of glioblastoma multiforme, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma, all cancers of neural
tissue. LB-100 enhances the effectiveness of commonly used anti-cancer drugs in melanoma, breast cancer and sarcoma animal models. The
enhancement of anti-cancer activity of these anti-cancer drugs occurs at doses of LB-100 that do not significantly increase toxicity
in animals. It is therefore hoped that, when combined with standard anti-cancer regimens against many tumor types, LB-100 will improve
therapeutic benefit. 

As
a compound moves through the FDA-approval process, it becomes an increasingly valuable property, but at a cost of additional investment
at each stage. As the potential effectiveness of LB-100 has been documented at the clinical trial level, the Company has allocated resources
to expand the breadth and depth of its patent portfolio. The Company s approach has been to operate with a minimum of overhead,
moving compounds forward as efficiently and inexpensively as possible, and to raise funds to support each of these stages as certain
milestones are reached. The Company s longer-term objective is to secure one or more strategic partnerships or licensing agreements
with pharmaceutical companies with major programs in cancer. 

Intellectual
Property 

The
Company s intellectual property includes proprietary know-how, proprietary methodologies and extensive clinical validation data
and publications. To provide legal protection of the Company s intellectual property, the Company relies on a combination of patents,
licenses, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality and non-disclosure clauses and agreements, and other forms of intellectual property
protection to define and protect our rights to the Company s product candidates. 

The
Company s product candidates are expected to be covered by its patents. These patents now cover sole rights to the composition
and synthesis of the Company s LB-100 series of drugs, which is the Company s lead clinical compound in development. The
Company has filed patent applications covering the treatment of cancer with LB-100. The Company has also filed joint patent applications
with the NIH and the Netherlands Cancer Institute for the treatment of cancer using LB-100 in combination with other drugs such as an
immune checkpoint inhibitor and a WEE1 inhibitor. 

Patent
applications for the LB-100 series (oxabicycloheptanes and oxabicycloheptenes) have been filed in the United States and internationally
under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Patents for composition of matter and for several uses of the LB-100 series have been issued in
the United States, Mexico, Australia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Canada, and by the European Patent Office 

The
Company strives to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the
development of its business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending its patent rights, which are owned solely by the Company s
wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Lixte Biotechnology, Inc., except in several instances jointly with one of the Company s many
collaborators. The Company also relies on trade secrets relating to its proprietary pipeline of product candidates and on know-how and
continuing technological innovation to develop and strengthen its pipeline. The Company intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded
by regulatory agencies through data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions, where available. 

The
Company s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially
important technology, inventions and know-how related to its business; defend and enforce its patents; preserve the confidentiality of
its trade secrets; and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights of third parties. The Company s
ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing its technology may depend on the extent to
which the Company has rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases,
enforcement of these rights may depend on cooperation of the joint owners of the Company s jointly owned patents and patent applications. 

41 

With
respect to both the Company s solely and jointly owned intellectual property, the Company cannot be sure that patents will be granted
on any of its pending patent applications or on any patent applications filed solely or jointly by the Company in the future; the Company
cannot be sure that any of its existing patents or any patents that may be granted to the Company in the future will be commercially
useful in protecting the Company s intended commercial products or therapeutic methods; and the Company cannot be sure that an
agency or court would determine that its solely or jointly owned patents are valid and enforceable. 

Specific
Risks Associated with the Company s Business Activities 

Serious
Adverse Events 

The
Company s lead drug candidate, LB-100, is currently undergoing various clinical trials, and there is a risk that one or more of
these trials could be placed on hold by regulatory authorities due to serious adverse events (SAEs) related to our drug candidate or
to another company s drug used in combination in one of our clinical trials. It is possible that the SAEs could be attributable
to our drug candidate and could include, but not be limited to, unexpected severe side effects, treatment-related deaths, or long-term
health complications. A dose given could result in non-tolerable adverse events defined as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). When two DLTs
occur at the same dose-level that dose-level is considered too high and unsafe. Further treatment is only allowed at lower dose-levels
that have previously been found safe. 

If
an SAE or a pattern of SAEs is observed during the course of a clinical trial involving our drug candidate, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), or other regulatory authorities may issue a clinical hold, requiring us to pause or discontinue
further enrollment and dosing in our clinical trial. It is also possible that the clinical trial could be terminated. Any of these actions
could delay or halt the development of our drug candidate, increase development costs, and negatively impact our ability to ultimately
achieve regulatory approval. Additionally, if an SAE is confirmed to be drug-related, we may be required to conduct additional studies,
modify the study design, or abandon further development of the drug candidate altogether, which could materially impact our business,
financial condition, and prospects. 

The
occurrence of an SAE and any resulting clinical hold could also harm our reputation with patients, physicians, health institutions, and
investors, diminish our ability to attract clinical trial participants, and damage our ability to interest investors and obtain financing
in the future. There can be no assurance that we will not experience such SAEs in the future or that any related clinical hold will be
lifted in a timely manner, or at all. 

The
principal investigator of the colorectal study testing LB-100 in combination with atezolizumab (Roche PD-L1 inhibitor) is currently investigating
two SAEs observed in the clinical trial that was launched in August 2024. Evaluation is underway to determine next steps. 

Other
Business Risks 

Covid-19
Virus . The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in early 2020 led to disruptions in general economic activities throughout
the world as businesses and governments implemented broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. Although Covid-19 outbreak has
subsided, the extent to which the coronavirus or any other pandemics may reappear and impact the Company s clinical trial programs
and capital raising efforts in the future is uncertain and cannot be predicted. 

Inflation
and Interest Rate Risk. The Company does not believe that inflation or increasing interest rates has had a material effect on its
operations to date, other than its impact on the general economy. However, there is a risk that the Company s operating costs could
become subject to inflationary and interest rate pressures in the future, which would have the effect of increasing the Company s
operating costs (including, specifically, clinical trial costs), and which would put additional stress on the Company s working
capital resources. 

Supply
Chain Issues. The Company does not currently expect that supply chain issues will have a significant impact on its business activities,
including its ongoing clinical trials. 

Potential
Recession. There are some indications that the United States economy may be at risk of entering a recessionary period. Although unclear
at this time, an economic recession would likely impact the general business environment and the capital markets, which could, in turn,
affect the Company. 

42 

Geopolitical
Risk. The geopolitical landscape poses inherent risks that could significantly impact the operations and financial performance of
the Company. In the event of a military conflict, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical uncertainties, and economic repercussions may
adversely affect the Company s ability to conduct research, develop, test and manufacture products, and distribute them globally.
This could lead to delays in product development, interruptions in the supply of critical materials, and delays in clinical trials, thereby
impeding the Company s clinical development and commercialization plans. Furthermore, the impact of a conflict on global financial
markets may result in increased volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, thereby affecting the valuation of the Company s
publicly-traded shares. Investor confidence, market sentiment, and access to capital may all be negatively influenced. Such geopolitical
risks are outside the control of the Company, and the actual effects on the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations may differ from current estimates. 

Cybersecurity
Risks. The Company has established policies and processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risk from cybersecurity
threats, and has integrated these processes into its overall risk management systems and processes. The Company routinely assesses material
risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through its information and email systems
that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the Company s information and email systems
or any information residing therein. The Company conducts periodic risk assessments to identify cybersecurity threats, as well as assessments
in the event of a material change in the Company s business practices that may affect information systems that are vulnerable to
such cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, the
likelihood and potential damage that could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems and
safeguards in place to manage such risks. The Company has not encountered any cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired
its operations or financial condition. Additional information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats is provided in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

The
Company is continuing to monitor these matters and will adjust its current business and financing plans as more information and guidance
become available.

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 1,360,008, as compared to working capital of 3,994,762 at December 31, 2023,
reflecting a decrease in working capital of 2,634,754 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in working capital
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the funding of the Company s ongoing research and development
activities and other ongoing operating expenses, including maintaining and developing the Company s patent portfolio. At September
30, 2024, the Company had cash of 1,637,627 available to fund its operations. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its research
and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profitability. The amount and timing of future
cash requirements depends on the pace, design, and results of the Company s clinical trial program, which, in turn, depends on
the availability of operating capital to fund such activities. 

Based
on current operating plans, the Company estimates that its existing cash resources at September 30, 2024 will provide sufficient working
capital to fund the current clinical trial program with respect to the development of the Company s lead anti-cancer clinical compound,
LB-100, through the first quarter of 2025. As existing cash resources will not be sufficient to complete the clinical development of,
and obtain regulatory approval for, the Company s product candidate, the Company will need to raise additional capital in one or
more tranches to fund its operations during the next few months in order to be able to effectively manage its current business plan during
2025 and thereafter, as well as to maintain its listing on Nasdaq. Furthermore, the Company s operating plans and capital requirements
may change as a result of many factors that are currently unknown and/or outside of the control of the Company. The Company is considering
various strategies and alternatives to obtain the required additional capital. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining financial contractual commitments pursuant to clinical trial agreements and clinical
trial monitoring agreements not yet incurred aggregated 3,918,000, which are currently scheduled to be incurred through approximately
December 31, 2027. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Operating
Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities utilized cash of 2,565,861, as compared to utilizing
cash of 3,391,142 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to fund the Company s ongoing research and development activities
and to fund its other ongoing operating expenses, including maintaining and developing its patent portfolio. 

Investing
Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no investing activities. 

Financing
Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no financing activities. For the nine months ended September
30, 2023, financing activities consisted primarily of the gross proceeds from the sale of securities in the Company s registered
direct offering of 3,499,964, reduced by offering costs of 362,925, and 6,281 from the exercise of common stock options. 

Principal
Commitments 

Clinical
Trial Agreements 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining financial contractual commitments pursuant to clinical trial agreements and clinical
trial monitoring agreements not yet incurred, as described below, aggregated 3,918,000, including clinical trial agreements of 3,616,000
and clinical trial monitoring agreements of 302,000, which, based on current estimates, are currently scheduled to be incurred through
approximately December 31, 2027. The Company s ability to conduct and fund these contractual commitments is subject to the timely
availability of sufficient capital to fund such expenditures, as well as any changes in the allocation or reallocation of such funds
to the Company s current or future clinical trial programs. The Company expects that the full amount of these expenditures will
be incurred only if such clinical trial programs are conducted as originally designed and their respective enrollments and duration are
not modified or reduced. Clinical trial programs, such as the types that the Company is engaged in, can be highly variable and can frequently
involve a series of changes and modifications over time as clinical data is obtained and analyzed, and is frequently modified, suspended
or terminated, in part based on receipt or lack of receipt of an indication of clinical benefit or activity, before the clinical trial
endpoint is reached. Accordingly, such contractual commitments as discussed herein should be considered as estimates only based on current
clinical assumptions and conditions and are typically subject to significant modifications and revisions over time.

Netherlands
Cancer Institute. Effective June 10, 2024, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the Netherlands Cancer Institute NKI to conduct a Phase 1b clinical trial of the Company s protein phosphatase inhibitor, LB-100, combined with
atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, the proprietary molecule of F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. Roche ), for patients with microsatellite
stable metastatic colon cancer. Under the agreement, the Company will provide its lead compound, LB-100, and under a separate agreement
between NKI and Roche, Roche will provide atezolizumab and financial support for the clinical trial. The Company has no obligation to
and will not provide any reimbursement of clinical trial costs. Pursuant to the agreement and the protocol set forth in the agreement,
the clinical trial will be conducted by NKI at NKI s site in Amsterdam by principal investigator Neeltje Steeghs, MD, PhD, and
NKI will be responsible for the recruitment of patients. The agreement provides for the protection of the respective intellectual property
rights of each of the Company, NKI and Roche. 

This
Phase 1b clinical trial will evaluate safety, optimal dose and preliminary efficacy of LB-100 combined with atezolizumab for the treatment
of patients with metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer. Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies like atezolizumab can
enhance the body s immune response against cancer and hinder tumor growth and spread. LB-100 has been found to improve the effectiveness
of anticancer drugs in killing cancer cells by inhibiting a protein called PP2A on cell surfaces. Blocking PP2A increases stress signals
in tumor cells expressing the PP2A protein. Accordingly, combining atezolizumab with LB-100 may enhance treatment efficacy for metastatic
colorectal cancer, as cancer cells with heightened stress signals are more vulnerable to immunotherapy. 

This
study comprises a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The objective of the dose escalation phase is to determine the recommended
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LB-100 when combined with the standard dosage of atezolizumab. The dose expansion phase will further investigate
the preliminary efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/dynamics of the LB-100 and atezolizumab combination. The clinical
trial opened in August 2024 with the enrollment of the first patient. Patient accrual is expected to take up to 24 months, with a maximum
of 37 patients with advanced colorectal cancer to be enrolled in this study. 

The
principal investigator of the colorectal study testing LB-100 in combination with atezolizumab is currently investigating two Serious
Adverse Events SAEs observed in the clinical trial. Evaluation is underway to determine next steps (see Serious
Adverse Events below for additional information). 

The
Company has no financial contractual commitment associated with this clinical trial. 

City
of Hope. Effective January 18, 2021, the Company executed a Clinical Research Support Agreement (the Agreement with
the City of Hope National Medical Center, an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and City of Hope Medical Foundation (collectively,
 City of Hope ), to carry out a Phase 1b clinical trial of LB-100, the Company s first-in-class protein phosphatase
inhibitor, combined with an FDA-approved standard regimen for treatment of untreated extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer ED-SCLC ).
LB-100 was given in combination with carboplatin, etoposide and atezolizumab, an FDA-approved standard of care regimen, to previously
untreated ED-SCLC patients. The LB-100 dose was to be escalated with the standard fixed doses of the 3-drug regimen to reach a recommended
Phase 2 dose RP2D ). Patient entry was to be expanded so that a total of 12 patients would be evaluable at the RP2D to
confirm the safety of the LB-100 combination and to look for potential therapeutic activity as assessed by objective response rate, duration
of overall response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. 

The
clinical trial was initiated on March 9, 2021, with patient accrual expected to take approximately two years to complete. Because patient
accrual was slower than expected, effective March 6, 2023, the Company and City of Hope added the Sarah Cannon Research Institute SCRI ),
Nashville, Tennessee, to the ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial. The Company and City of Hope continued efforts to increase patient accrual
by adding additional sites and by modifying the protocol to increase the number of patients eligible for the clinical trial. The impact
of these efforts to increase patient accrual and to decrease time to completion was evaluated in subsequent quarters. 

After
evaluating patient accrual through June 30, 2024, the Company and City of Hope agreed to close the clinical trial. Pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement, the Company provided notice to City of Hope of the Company s intent to terminate the Agreement effective as of
July 8, 2024. Upon closure, the Company incurred a prorated charge of 207,004 for the cost of patients enrolled to date. The Company
is exploring alternative sites, including international locations, for the conduct of a small cell lung cancer clinical trial. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of 207,004 and 0, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of 285,019 and 69,001, respectively, pursuant
to this Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, total costs of 732,532 had been incurred pursuant to this Agreement.

GEIS.
 Effective July 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement for an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial with the
Spanish Sarcoma Group (Grupo Espa ol de Investigaci n en Sarcomas or GEIS ), Madrid, Spain, to carry out a
study entitled Randomized phase I/II trial of LB-100 plus doxorubicin vs. doxorubicin alone in first line of advanced soft tissue
sarcoma . The purpose of this clinical trial is to obtain information with respect to the efficacy and safety of LB-100 combined
with doxorubicin in soft tissue sarcomas. Doxorubicin is the global standard for initial treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas ASTS ).
Doxorubicin alone has been the mainstay of first line treatment of ASTS for over 40 years, with little improvement in survival from adding
cytotoxic compounds to or substituting other cytotoxic compounds for doxorubicin. In animal models, LB-100 consistently enhances the
anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin without apparent increases in toxicity. 

GEIS
has a network of referral centers in Spain and across Europe that have an impressive track record of efficiently conducting innovative
studies in ASTS. The Company agreed to provide GEIS with a supply of LB-100 to be utilized in the conduct of this clinical trial, as
well as to provide funding for the clinical trial. The goal is to enter approximately 150 to 170 patients in this clinical trial over
a period of two to four years. The Phase 1 portion of the study began in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 to determine the recommended
Phase 2 dose of the combination of doxorubicin and LB-100. As advanced sarcoma is a very aggressive disease, the design of the Phase
2 portion of the study assumes a median progression-free survival PFS ), no evidence of disease progression or death from
any cause, of 4.5 months in the doxorubicin arm and an alternative median PFS of 7.5 months in the doxorubicin plus LB-100 arm to demonstrate
a statistically significant decrease in relative risk of progression or death by adding LB-100. There is a planned interim analysis of
the primary endpoint when approximately 50 of the 102 events required for final analysis is reached. 

The
Company had previously expected that this clinical trial would commence during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. However, during July
2020, the Spanish regulatory authority advised the Company that although it had approved the scientific and ethical basis of the protocol,
it required that the Company manufacture new inventory of LB-100 under current Spanish pharmaceutical manufacturing standards. These
standards were adopted subsequent to the production of the Company s existing LB-100 inventory. 

In
order to manufacture a new inventory supply of LB-100 for the GEIS clinical trial, the Company engaged a number of vendors to carry out
the multiple tasks needed to make and gain approval of a new clinical product for investigational study in Spain. These tasks included
the synthesis under good manufacturing practice (GMP) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), with documentation of each of the
steps involved by an independent auditor. The API was then transferred to a vendor that prepares the clinical drug product, also under
GMP conditions documented by an independent auditor. The clinical drug product was then sent to a vendor to test for purity and sterility,
provide appropriate labels, store the drug, and distribute the drug to the clinical centers for use in the clinical trials. A formal
application documenting all steps taken to prepare the clinical drug product for clinical use was submitted to the appropriate regulatory
authorities for review and approval before being used in a clinical trial. 

As
of December 31, 2023, this program to provide new inventory of the clinical drug product for the Spanish Sarcoma Group study, and potentially
for subsequent multiple trials within the European Union, had cost approximately 1,144,000. 

On
October 13, 2022, the Company announced that the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (Agencia Espa ola de Medicamentos
y Productos Sanitarios or AEMPS had authorized a Phase 1b/randomized Phase 2 study of LB-100, the Company s lead
clinical compound, plus doxorubicin, versus doxorubicin alone, the global standard for initial treatment of ASTS. Consequently, this
clinical trial commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and is expected to be completed and a report prepared by December 31,
2026. In April 2023, GEIS completed its first site initiation visit in preparation for the clinical trial at Fundaci n Jim nez
D az University Hospital (Madrid). Up to 170 patents will be entered into the clinical trial. The recruitment for the Phase 1b
portion of the protocol was extended with two patients and was completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects
to have data on toxicity and preliminary efficacy from this portion of the clinical trial by December 31, 2024, and a full report by
June 30, 2025. Subject to clinical results and the availability of sufficient working capital resources, the Company anticipates that
it will then be in a position to decide whether to proceed to the related Phase 2 portion of the study. 

The
interim analysis of the Phase 2 portion of this clinical trial will be done before full accrual of patients is completed to determine
whether the study has the possibility of showing superiority of the combination of LB-100 plus doxorubicin compared to doxorubicin alone.
A positive study would have the potential to change the standard therapy for this disease after four decades of failure to improve the
marginal benefit of doxorubicin alone.

The
Company s agreement with GEIS provides for various payments based on achieving specific milestones over the term of the agreement.
During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any costs pursuant to this agreement. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred costs of 0 and 268,829, respectively, pursuant to this agreement.
Through September 30, 2024, the Company has incurred charges of 684,652 for work done under this agreement through the fourth milestone. 

The
Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this agreement, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 3,616,000
(consisting of 284,000 for the Phase 1b portion and 3,332,000 for the Phase 2 portion) as of September 30, 2024, which is scheduled
to be incurred through December 31, 2027. As the work is being conducted in Europe and is paid for in Euros, final costs are subject
to foreign currency fluctuations between the United States Dollar and the Euro. Such fluctuations are recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as foreign currency gain or loss, as appropriate, and have not been significant. 

MD
Anderson Cancer Center Clinical Trial . On September 20, 2023, the Company announced an investigator-initiated Phase 1b/2 collaborative
clinical trial to assess whether adding LB-100 to a human programmed death receptor-1 PD-1 blocking antibody of GSK plc GSK ), dostarlimab-gxly, may enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy in the treatment of ovarian clear cell carcinoma OCCC ). The study objective is to determine the overall survival OS of patients with OCCC. The clinical
trial is being sponsored by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center MD Anderson and is being conducted at The
University of Texas - MD Anderson Cancer Center. The Company is providing LB-100 and GSK is providing dostarlimab-gxly and financial
support for the clinical trial. On January 29, 2024, the Company announced the entry of the first patient into this clinical trial. The
Company currently expects that this clinical trial will be completed by December 31, 2027. 

Moffitt.
 Effective August 20, 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Research Agreement with the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research
Institute Hospital Inc., Tampa, Florida Moffitt ), effective for a term of five years. Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Research
Agreement, Moffitt agreed to conduct and manage a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the toxicity and therapeutic benefit of the Company s
lead anti-cancer clinical compound LB-100 to be administered intravenously in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic
syndrome MDS ). 

In
November 2018, the Company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its Investigational New Drug IND Application to conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the toxicity and therapeutic benefit of LB-100 in patients with low and
intermediate-1 risk MDS who had failed or were intolerant of standard treatment. This Phase 1b/2 clinical trial utilized LB-100 as a
single agent in the treatment of patients with low and intermediate-1 risk MDS. 

The
clinical trial began at a single site in April 2019 and the first patient was entered into the clinical trial in July 2019. During the
year ended December 31, 2023, the clinical trial was closed. Although the maximum tolerated dose MTD was not achieved,
there was no dose-limiting toxicity noted. 

During
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not incur any costs pursuant to this agreement. As
of September 30, 2024, total costs of 147,239 had been incurred pursuant to this agreement. 

During
September 2023, the Company decided not to pursue further studies in MDS, as other, more promising, opportunities had become available
(see Patent and License Agreements - Moffitt below). 

National
Cancer Institute Pharmacologic Clinical Trial. In May 2019, the National Cancer Institute NCI initiated a glioblastoma GBM pharmacologic clinical trial. This study was being conducted and funded by the NCI under a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement, with the Company responsible for providing the LB-100 clinical compound. The NCI study was designed to determine
the extent to which LB-100 enters recurrent malignant gliomas. Patients having surgery to remove one or more tumors received one dose
of LB-100 prior to surgery and had blood and tumor tissue analyzed to determine the amount of LB-100 present and to determine whether
the cells in the tumors showed the biochemical changes expected to be present if LB-100 reached its molecular target. As a result of
the innovative design of the NCI study, it was believed that data from a few patients would be sufficient to provide a sound rationale
for conducting a larger clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of adding LB-100 to the standard treatment regimen for GBMs. Blood
and brain tumor tissue were analyzed from seven patients after intravenous infusion of a single dose of LB-100. Results of the investigation
demonstrated that there was virtually no entry of LB-100 into the brain tumor tissue. Accordingly, alternative methods of drug delivery
will be required to determine if LB-100 has meaningful clinical anti-cancer activity against glioblastoma multiforme and other aggressive
brain tumors. The Company is considering an additional clinical study to address the delivery of LB-100 to the brain.

The
Company s aggregate commitment pursuant to this contract, less amounts previously paid to date, totaled approximately 124,000
as of September 30, 2024. 

Trends,
Events and Uncertainties 

Research
and development of new pharmaceutical compounds is, by its nature, unpredictable. Although the Company undertakes research and development
efforts with commercially reasonable diligence, there can be no assurance that the Company s cash position will be sufficient to
enable it to develop pharmaceutical compounds to the extent needed to create future revenues sufficient to sustain operations. 

There
can be no assurances that the Company s pharmaceutical compounds will obtain the regulatory approvals and market acceptance to
achieve sustainable revenues sufficient to support operations. Even if the Company is able to generate revenues, there can be no assurances
that it will be able to achieve operating profitability or positive operating cash flows. There can be no assurances that the Company
will be able to secure additional financing, to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If cash resources are insufficient
to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company would be required to reduce or discontinue its research and development
programs, or attempt to obtain funds, if available (although there can be no assurances), through strategic alliances that may require
the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its pharmaceutical compounds, or to curtail or discontinue its operations entirely. 

Other
than as discussed herein, the Company is not currently aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material
effect on its financial condition in the near term, although it is possible that new trends or events may develop in the future that
could have a material effect on the Company s financial condition.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), that is designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the most recent fiscal period
covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect that there are resource constraints and that management is required to
apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has determined that no change in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company is not currently subject to any pending or threatened legal actions or claims. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

The
Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which
are beyond the Company s control, including those set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 19, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). 

The
Risk Factors set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K should be read carefully in connection with evaluating the Company s business and
in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described in the
2023 Form 10-K could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or future results, and the actual
outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. These are not the only risks that the Company faces. Additional risks
and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely
affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

As
of the date of the filing of this document, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously
disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Serious
Adverse Events 

The
Company s lead drug candidate, LB-100, is currently undergoing various clinical trials, and there is a risk that one or more of
these trials could be placed on hold by regulatory authorities due to serious adverse events (SAEs) related to our drug candidate or
to another company s drug used in combination in one of our clinical trials. It is possible that the SAEs could be attributable
to our drug candidate and could include, but not be limited to, unexpected severe side effects, treatment-related deaths, or long-term
health complications. A dose given could result in non-tolerable adverse events defined as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). When two DLTs
occur at the same dose-level that dose-level is considered too high and unsafe. Further treatment is only allowed at lower dose-levels
that have previously been found safe. 

If
an SAE or a pattern of SAEs is observed during the course of a clinical trial involving our drug candidate, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), or other regulatory authorities may issue a clinical hold, requiring us to pause or discontinue
further enrollment and dosing in our clinical trial. It is also possible that the clinical trial could be terminated. Any of these actions
could delay or halt the development of our drug candidate, increase development costs, and negatively impact our ability to ultimately
achieve regulatory approval. Additionally, if an SAE is confirmed to be drug-related, we may be required to conduct additional studies,
modify the study design, or abandon further development of the drug candidate altogether, which could materially impact our business,
financial condition, and prospects. 

The
occurrence of an SAE and any resulting clinical hold could also harm our reputation with patients, physicians, health institutions, and
investors, diminish our ability to attract clinical trial participants, and damage our ability to interest investors and obtain financing
in the future. There can be no assurance that we will not experience such SAEs in the future or that any related clinical hold will be
lifted in a timely manner, or at all. 

The
principal investigator of the colorectal study testing LB-100 in combination with atezolizumab (Roche PD-L1 inhibitor) is currently investigating
two SAEs observed in the clinical trial that was launched in August 2024. Evaluation is underway to determine next steps.
