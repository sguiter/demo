Allowances represented approximately and of accounts receivable (including unbilled revenues) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accounts Receivable Allowance for Credit Losses PSE G s accounts receivable, including unbilled revenues, is primarily comprised of utility customer receivables for the provision of electric and gas service and appliance services, and are reported on the balance sheet as gross outstanding amounts adjusted for an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects PSE G s best estimate of losses on the account balances. The allowance is based on PSE G s projection of accounts receivable aging, historical experience, economic factors and other currently available evidence, including the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024. PSE G s electric bad debt expense is recoverable through its Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) mechanism. As of September 30, 2024 , PSE G had a deferred balance of million from electric bad debts recorded as a Regulatory Asset, which included approximately million of incremental bad debt due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 , PSE G had deferred incremental gas bad debt expense of million as a Regulatory Asset for future regulatory recovery due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

 Energy Holdings Energy Holdings, through its indirect subsidiaries, has investments in assets subject primarily to leveraged lease accounting. A leveraged lease is typically comprised of an investment by an equity investor and debt provided by a third-party debt investor. The debt is recourse only to the assets subject to lease and is not included on PSEG s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As an equity investor, Energy Holdings equity investments in the leases are comprised of the total expected lease receivables over the lease terms, reduced for any income not yet earned on the leases. This amount is included in Long-Term Investments on PSEG s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The more rapid depreciation of the leased property for tax purposes creates tax cash flow that will be repaid to the taxing authority in later periods. As such, the liability for such taxes due is recorded in Deferred Income Taxes on PSEG s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Leveraged leases outstanding as of September 30, 2024 commenced in or prior to 2000.

PSEG Power periodically assesses individual debt securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost to determine whether the investments are impaired. For these securities, management considers its intent to sell or requirement to sell a security prior to expected recovery. In those cases where a sale is expected, any impairment would be recorded through earnings. For fixed income securities where there is no intent to sell or likely requirement to sell, management evaluates whether credit loss is a component of the impairment. If so, that portion is recorded through earnings while the noncredit loss component is recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any subsequent recoveries of the noncredit loss component of the impairment would be recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any subsequent recoveries of the credit loss component would be recognized through earnings. The assessment of fair market value compared to cost is applied on a weighted average basis taking into account various purchase dates and initial cost of the securities. Rabbi Trust PSEG maintains certain unfunded nonqualified benefit plans to provide supplemental retirement and deferred compensation benefits to certain key employees. Certain assets related to these plans have been set aside in a grantor trust commonly known as a Rabbi Trust.

As part of determining credit exposure, PSEG Power nets receivables and payables with the corresponding net fair values of energy contracts. See Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities for further discussion. In accordance with PSEG s accounting policy, where it is applicable, cash (received)/deposited is allocated against derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty on the face of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining balances of net cash (received)/deposited after allocation are generally included in Accounts Payable and Receivable, respectively. In addition to amounts for outstanding guarantees, current exposure and margin positions, PSEG and PSEG Power have posted letters of credit to support PSEG Power s various other non-energy contractual and environmental obligations. See Other Letters of Credit in the preceding table. Environmental Matters Passaic River Lower Passaic River Study Area The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that a 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River (Lower Passaic River Study Area (LPRSA)) in New Jersey is a Superfund site under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). PSE G and certain of its predecessors conducted operations at properties in this area, including at site that was transferred to PSEG Power. The EPA has announced two separate cleanup plans for the Lower 8.3 miles and Upper 9 miles of the LPRSA. The EPA s plan for the Lower 8.3 miles involves dredging and capping sediments at an estimated cost of billion, and its plan for the Upper 9 miles involves dredging and capping sediments at an estimated cost of million. Additional cleanup work may be required depending on the results of these initial phases of work. Occidental Chemical Corporation (Occidental) has voluntarily completed the design of the cleanup plan for the Lower 8.3 miles and has received an EPA Unilateral Administrative Order directing it to design the cleanup plan for the Upper 9 miles. It

PSE G and PSEG Power are not included in the proposed settlement, but the EPA sent PSE G, Occidental, and several other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) a letter in March 2022 inviting them to submit to the EPA individually or jointly an offer to fund or participate in the next stages of the remediation. PSEG submitted a good faith offer to the EPA in June 2022 on behalf of PSE G and PSEG Power. PSEG understands that the EPA is evaluating its offer. As of September 30, 2024 , PSEG has approximately million accrued for this matter. PSE G has an Environmental Costs Liability of million and a corresponding Regulatory Asset based on its continued ability to recover such costs in its rates. PSEG Power has an Environmental Costs Liability of million. The outcome of this matter is uncertain, and until (i) a final remedy for the entire LPRSA is selected and an agreement is reached by the PRPs to fund it, (ii) PSE G s and PSEG Power s respective shares of the costs are determined, and (iii) PSE G s ability to recover the costs in its rates is determined, it is not possible to predict this matter s ultimate impact on PSEG s financial statements. It is possible that PSE G and PSEG Power will record additional costs beyond what they have accrued, and that such costs could be material, but PSEG cannot at the current time estimate the amount or range of any additional costs. Newark Bay Study Area The EPA has established the Newark Bay Study Area, which is an extension of the LPRSA and includes Newark Bay and portions of surrounding waterways. The EPA has notified PSEG and other PRPs of their potential liability. PSE G and PSEG Power are unable to estimate their respective portions of any loss or possible range of loss related to this matter. In December 2018, PSEG Power completed the sale of the site of the Hudson electric generating station. PSEG Power contractually transferred all land rights and structures on the Hudson site to a third-party purchaser, along with the assumption of the environmental liabilities for the site. Natural Resource Damage Claims New Jersey and certain federal regulators have alleged that PSE G, PSEG Power and other PRPs may be liable for natural resource damages within the LPRSA. In particular, PSE G, PSEG Power and other PRPs received notice from federal regulators of the regulators intent to move forward with a series of studies assessing potential damages to natural resources at the Diamond Alkali Superfund site, which includes the LPRSA and the Newark Bay Study Area. PSE G and PSEG Power are unable to estimate their respective portions of any possible loss or range of loss related to this matter. Hackensack River In 2022, the EPA announced it had designated approximately 23 river miles of the Lower Hackensack River as a federal Superfund site. PSE G and certain of its predecessors conducted operations at properties in this area, including at the Hudson, Bergen and Kearny generating stations that were transferred to PSEG Power. PSEG Power subsequently contractually transferred all land rights and structures on the Hudson generating station site to a third-party purchaser, along with the assumption of the environmental liabilities for that site. In 2024, the EPA identified PSE G and four other parties as PRPs for the site and requested that they voluntarily perform a technical study of a portion of the river designated as Operable Unit 2. The EPA estimates that the technical study will cost million to complete and PSE G and PSEG Power have agreed to participate in the technical study. PSE G and PSEG Power do not believe participation in the technical study will have a material impact on their results of operations and financial condition based upon EPA s estimate of the study costs; however, future costs related to this matter could be material. Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) Remediation Program PSE G is working with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to assess, investigate and remediate environmental conditions at its former MGP sites. To date, 38 sites requiring some level of remedial action have been identified. Based on its current studies, PSE G has determined that the estimated cost to remediate all MGP sites to

 million and million on an undiscounted basis, including its million share for the Passaic River as discussed above. Since no amount within the range is considered to be most likely, PSE G has recorded a liability of million as of September 30, 2024 . Of this amount, million was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and million was reflected as Environmental Costs in Noncurrent Liabilities. PSE G has recorded a million Regulatory Asset with respect to these costs. PSE G periodically updates its studies taking into account any new regulations or new information which could impact future remediation costs and adjusts its recorded liability accordingly. PSE G completed sampling in the Passaic River in 2020 to delineate coal tar from certain MGP sites that abut the Passaic River Superfund site. PSEG cannot determine at this time the magnitude of any impact on the Passaic River Superfund remedy. Legacy Environmental Obligations at Former Fossil Generating Sites PSEG Power has retained ownership of certain liabilities excluded from the 2022 sale of its fossil generation portfolio. These liabilities primarily relate to obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act (ISRA) and the Connecticut Transfer Act (CTA) to investigate and remediate PSEG Power s two formerly owned generating station sites in Connecticut, and six formerly owned generating station sites in New Jersey. In addition, PSEG Power still owns two former generating station sites in New Jersey that triggered ISRA in 2015. PSEG Power is in the process of fulfilling its obligations under the New Jersey ISRA and the CTA to investigate these sites. It will require multiple years and comprehensive environmental sampling to understand the extent of and to carry out the required remediation. At this stage in the remediation process, the full remediation costs are not estimable, but given the number and operating history of the facilities in the portfolio, the full remediation costs will likely be material in the aggregate. The costs could potentially include costs for, among other things, excavating soil, implementation of institutional controls, and the construction, operation and maintenance of engineering controls. In May 2024, the EPA finalized revisions to the coal combustion residuals rule (CCR Rule) which established new requirements for the investigation and, if necessary, the cleanup of certain types of coal ash placed at certain fossil generation station sites, including certain sites owned or formerly owned by PSEG Power. PSEG is in the process of investigating each of the sites that PSEG Power currently owns that are subject to the CCR Rule, as well as sites that were formerly owned that are subject to the CCR Rule where PSEG Power retained certain environmental obligations to investigate and, if necessary, remediate. PSEG is currently unable to estimate the impact of the CCR Rule, but it could have a material impact on PSEG s business, results of operations and cash flows. Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 316(b) Rule The EPA s CWA Section 316(b) rule establishes requirements for the design and operation of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day. In June 2016, the NJDEP issued a final New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for Salem. In July 2016, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network (Riverkeeper) filed an administrative hearing request challenging certain conditions of the permit, including the NJDEP s application of the 316(b) rule. If the Riverkeeper s challenge is successful, PSEG Power may be required to incur additional costs to comply with the CWA. Potential cooling water and/or service water system modification costs could be material and could adversely impact the economic competitiveness of this facility. Basic Generation Service (BGS), BGSS and ZECs Each year, PSE G obtains its electric supply requirements through annual New Jersey BGS auctions for two categories of customers that choose not to purchase electric supply from third-party suppliers. The first category is residential and smaller commercial and industrial customers (BGS-Residential Small Commercial Pricing (RSCP)). The second category is larger customers that exceed a BPU-established load (kilowatt (kW)) threshold (BGS-Commercial and Industrial Energy Pricing (CIEP)). Pursuant to applicable BPU rules, PSE G enters into the Supplier Master Agreements with the winners of these RSCP and CIEP BGS auctions to purchase BGS for PSE G s load requirements. The winners of the RSCP and CIEP auctions are responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of a PJM load-serving entity including the provision of capacity, energy, ancillary services and any other services required by PJM. BGS suppliers assume all volume risk and customer migration risk and must satisfy New Jersey s renewable portfolio standards.

PSE G has a full-requirements contract with PSEG Power to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE G s gas customers. PSEG Power has entered into hedges for a portion of these anticipated BGSS obligations, as permitted by the BPU. The BPU permits PSE G to recover the cost of gas hedging up to billion cubic feet or of its residential gas supply annual requirements through the BGSS tariff. Current plans call for PSEG Power to hedge on behalf of PSE G approximately billion cubic feet or of its residential gas supply annual requirements. For additional information, see Note 18. Related-Party Transactions. Pursuant to a process established by the BPU, New Jersey EDCs, including PSE G, are required to purchase ZECs from eligible nuclear plants selected by the BPU. In April 2021, PSEG Power s Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants were awarded ZECs for the three-year eligibility period from June 2022 through May 2025. PSE G has implemented a tariff to collect a non-bypassable distribution charge in the amount of per KWh from its retail distribution customers to be used to purchase the ZECs from these plants. PSE G will purchase the ZECs on a monthly basis with payment to be made annually following completion of each energy year. Minimum Fuel Purchase Requirements PSEG Power s nuclear fuel strategy is to maintain certain levels of uranium and to make periodic purchases to support such levels. As such, the commitments referred to in the following table may include estimated quantities to be purchased that deviate from contractual nominal quantities. PSEG Power s minimum nuclear fuel commitments cover approximately of its estimated uranium, enrichment and fabrication requirements through 2027 and a significant portion through 2028 at Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom. PSEG Power has various multi-year contracts for natural gas and firm transportation and storage capacity for natural gas that are primarily used to meet its obligations to PSE G.

 million and alleges that PSEG Power withheld money owed to Durr and that PSEG Power s intentional conduct led to the inability of Durr to obtain prospective contracts. PSEG Power intends to vigorously defend against these allegations. In January 2021, the court partially granted PSEG Power s motion to dismiss certain claims, reducing the amount claimed to million. In December 2018, Durr filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the federal court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The SDNY bankruptcy court has allowed the New Jersey litigation to proceed. PSEG Power has accrued an amount related to outstanding invoices which does not reflect an assessment of claims and potential counterclaims in this matter. Due to its preliminary nature, PSEG Power cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Other Litigation and Legal Proceedings PSEG and its subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. In view of the inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of such matters, PSEG and PSE G generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a liability is accrued when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. PSEG will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, other than the matters described herein, could have a material adverse effect on PSEG s or PSE G s consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond PSEG s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to PSEG s or PSE G s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.

 Short-Term Liquidity PSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of PSEG Power, primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and, from time to time, short-term loans. PSE G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facility. The commitments under the billion credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group. As of September 30, 2024 , the total available credit capacity was billion. As of September 30, 2024 , no single institution represented more than of the total commitments in the credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, PSEG s liquidity position, including credit facilities and access to external financing, was expected to be sufficient to meet its projected stressed requirements over a 12-month planning horizon. Each of the credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed in the following table; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support its subsidiaries liquidity needs.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following are the fair values of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following tables also include disclosures for offsetting derivative assets and liabilities which are subject to a master netting or similar agreement. In general, the terms of the agreements provide that in the event of an early termination the counterparties have the right to offset amounts owed or owing under that and any other agreement with the same counterparty. Accordingly, and in accordance with PSEG s accounting policy, these positions are offset on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of PSEG. For additional information see Note 12. Fair Value Measurements. Substantially all derivative instruments are contracts subject to master netting agreements. Contracts not subject to master netting or similar agreements are immaterial and did not have any collateral posted or received as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that PSEG Power would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations for the purchase and/or sale of energy, nuclear fuel and other related products, where PSEG Power has extended unsecured credit. PSEG has established credit policies that it believes significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. In the event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on PSEG s financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

 of the net credit exposure for PSEG Power s wholesale operations was with investment grade counterparties. There were two counterparties with credit exposure greater than of the total. These credit exposures were with PSE G and one non-affiliated counterparty. The PSE G credit exposure is eliminated in consolidation. See Note 18. Related-Party Transactions for additional information. PSE G s supplier master agreements are approved by the BPU and govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts. These agreements define a supplier s performance assurance requirements and allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day the procurement transaction is executed, compared to the forward price curve for energy on the valuation day. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post a parental guarantee or other security instrument such as a letter of credit or cash, as collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit. As of September 30, 2024, PSEG held parental guarantees, letters of credit and cash as security. PSE G s BGS suppliers credit exposure is calculated each business day. As of September 30, 2024 , PSE G had unsecured mark-to-market credit exposure with its suppliers. PSE G is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the BPU-approved BGS tariffs. PSE G s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISC USSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD A) 

This combined MD A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) and Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE G). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. 
 PSEG s business consists of two reportable segments, PSE G and PSEG Power LLC (PSEG Power) Other, primarily comprised of our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are: 
 PSE G which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and other federal and New Jersey state regulators. PSE G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency (EE) and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU, and 

PSEG Power which is an energy supply company that is comprised of the operations of merchant nuclear generating assets and fuel supply functions engaged in competitive energy sales via its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. PSEG Power s subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and other federal regulators and state regulators in the states in which they operate. 

The PSEG Power Other reportable segment also includes amounts related to the parent company as well as PSEG s other direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are: PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority s (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T D) system under an Operations Services Agreement (OSA); PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which primarily holds legacy lease investments and competitively bid, FERC regulated transmission; and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost. 
 Our business discussion in Item 1. Business of our 2023 Annual Report on 10-K (Form 10-K) provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. Our risk factor discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Form 10-K provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following supplements that discussion and the discussion included in the Executive Overview of 2023 and Future Outlook provided in Item 7 in our Form 10-K by describing significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2024 and changes to the key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. The following discussion refers to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the Related Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements, Notes and the Form 10-K. 
 EXECUTIVE OVER VIEW OF 2024 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK 
 We are a public utility holding company that, acting through our wholly owned subsidiaries, is a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility and a nuclear generation business. Our business plan focuses on achieving growth by allocating capital primarily toward regulated investments in an effort to continue to improve the sustainability and predictability of our business. We are focused on investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability and resilience, increase EE and deliver cleaner energy to meet customer expectations and be well aligned with public policy objectives. In addition, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) established a production tax credit (PTC) for existing nuclear facilities from 2024 through 2032. The PTC is expected to provide downside price protection for our nuclear generation fleet as the tax credit value is directly linked to a nuclear facility s gross receipts. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

For the years 2024-2028, our regulated capital investment program is estimated to be in a range of 18 billion to 21 billion. We expect these capital investments to result in a compound annual growth rate in our regulated rate base in a range of 6 to 7.5 from year-end 2023 to year-end 2028. The regulated capital investments represent the majority of PSEG s total capital investment program of 19 billion to 22.5 billion. The low end of the range includes an extension of our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) and Clean Energy Future (CEF)-EE program at their current average annual investment levels plus inflation, as these programs are expected to continue beyond their currently approved timeframes. The upper end of our capital investment range includes incremental investments, particularly for an expansion of our current EE programs as well as other clean energy and infrastructure investments. 
 PSE G 
 At PSE G, our focus is on investing capital in T D infrastructure and clean energy programs to enhance the reliability and resiliency of our T D system, meet customer expectations and support public policy objectives. 
 In 2023, the BPU approved a 280 million nine-month extension of our CEF-EE program through June 2024 and in May 2024 the BPU approved another approximate 300 million extension covering a commitment period from July 2024 through December 2024. In October 2024, the BPU approved our CEF-EE II filing authorizing a total spend of approximately 2.9 billion for energy efficiency projects committed between January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2027, and completed over an expected six-year period. The Order approved a program investment budget of approximately 1.9 billion, net of administrative expenses, and approximately 1 billion to continue our customer on-bill repayment program. This EE filing is a significant increase from our prior filings, driven by an increase in the savings targets required under the BPU Energy Efficiency Framework and higher costs to achieve those targeted savings. The filing also includes demand response programs and building decarbonization programs. 
 A remaining component of our CEF-Electric Vehicle (EV) program related to medium- and heavy-duty charging infrastructure has been the subject of a stakeholder process that the BPU began in 2021. In October 2024, the BPU released an Order that provided program guidance and minimum filing requirements for electric utility operated medium- and heavy-duty charging incentive programs, The Order caps PSE G s program investment at 30 million and requires electric utilities to submit program filings by February 20, 2025. In September 2022, the BPU released a draft Storage Incentive Program proposal and is undertaking a stakeholder process to determine the details of the program. Our proposed CEF-Energy Storage (ES) program for a 109 million investment is being held in abeyance until the BPU concludes its proceedings. 
 In 2023, the BPU also approved a two-year extension of our current GSMP program to replace at least 400 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains and services in our gas system. The GSMP program extension provides for main replacement through December 2025 plus trailing services replacement and paving costs into 2026 and totals approximately 900 million of investment. Of the 900 million, 750 million is recovered through three periodic rate updates with the balance recovered through a future distribution base rate case. 
 Our broader GSMP III, which also included projects to introduce renewable natural gas and hydrogen blending into our existing distribution system is being held in abeyance, with negotiations to be reinitiated by January 2025 with the intent of beginning the work in January 2026. 
 Pursuant to our GSMP II and Energy Strong II programs, we filed a distribution base rate case as required by the BPU in December 2023. In October 2024, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of PSE G s electric and gas distribution base rate case with new rates effective October 15, 2024. The Order provides for a 17.8 billion rate base, a 9.6 return on equity for PSE G s distribution business and a 55 equity component of its capitalization structure. For additional information, see Item 1. Note 4. Rate Filings.

PSEG Power 
 At PSEG Power, we seek to produce low-cost electricity by efficiently operating our nuclear generation assets, mitigate earnings volatility through the PTC mechanism and hedging, and support public policies that preserve these existing carbon-free base load nuclear generating plants. During the first nine months of 2024, our nuclear units generated approximately 23.3 terawatt hours and operated at a capacity factor of 91.4 . PSEG Power hedged approximately 90 to 95 of its expected generation output for 2024. Beginning in 2024, our hedging strategy has incorporated an estimated range of risk reduction impacts from the PTCs with potential incremental changes upon final U.S. Treasury guidance. In addition, we are exploring opportunities for the potential sale of power from our nuclear facilities pursuant to long-term agreements to supply large power users, such as data centers and hydrogen producers. 
 Climate Strategy and Sustainability Efforts 
 For more than a century, our purpose has been to provide safe access to an around-the-clock supply of reliable, affordable energy. Today, our vision is to power a future where people use less energy, and it is cleaner, safer and delivered more reliably than ever. We have established a net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 goal that includes direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from operations (Scope 2) across our business operations, assuming advances in technology, public policy and customer behavior. 
 PSE G has undertaken a number of initiatives that support the reduction of GHG emissions and the implementation of EE initiatives. PSE G s approved CEF-EE and EE II, CEF-Energy Cloud and CEF-EV programs and the proposed CEF-ES program are intended to support New Jersey s Energy Master Plan (EMP) and Gubernatorial Executive Orders through programs designed to help customers use energy more efficiently, reduce GHG emissions, support the expansion of the EV infrastructure in New Jersey, install energy storage capacity to supplement solar generation and enhance grid resiliency, install smart meters and supporting infrastructure to allow for the integration of other clean energy technologies and to more efficiently respond to weather and other outage events. 
 In addition, PSE G is committed to the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to approximately 1.9 million customers throughout New Jersey and we are equally committed to reducing GHG emissions associated with such operations. The GSMP is designed to significantly reduce natural gas leaks in our distribution system, which would reduce the release of methane, a potent GHG, into the air. Through GSMP II, from 2018 through 2023 we reduced reported methane emissions by approximately 27 system wide. We continue to assess physical risks of climate change and adapt our capital investment program to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system in an environment of increasing frequency and severity of weather events. 
 We also continue to focus on providing cleaner energy for our customers by working to preserve the economic viability of our nuclear units, which provide over 85 of the carbon-free energy in New Jersey. These efforts include reducing market risk by advocating for state and federal policies, such as the PTC established by the IRA, and capacity market reform at PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) that recognize the value of our nuclear fleet s carbon-free generation and its contribution to grid reliability. 
 Competitively Bid, FERC Regulated Transmission Projects 
 PSEG continues to evaluate investment opportunities in regulated transmission beyond PSE G. In December 2023, PJM awarded us an approximately 424 million project to address increasing load and reliability issues in Maryland and northern Virginia as part of its 2022 Window 3 competitive solicitation. The project has an expected in-service date of 2027. 
 In April 2024, PSE G submitted bids to the BPU for what the BPU has termed the Pre-Build Infrastructure (PBI) project, which is a combination of onshore and near-shore underwater infrastructure. The BPU is expected to announce the winner(s) of the PBI solicitation later in 2024. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

In April 2023, the BPU issued an order requesting that PJM conduct a second public policy transmission solicitation process utilizing the State Agreement Approach for transmission projects to support New Jersey s expanded offshore wind goal. However, in June 2024, the BPU paused this solicitation while it considers the impact of PJM s implementation of interconnection queue reform and the FERC Final Rule on transmission planning and cost allocation on its approach to procuring transmission to facilitate offshore wind development. The BPU has stated that the pause will last at least six months and will be reevaluated periodically. 
 PJM opened the 2024 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) Window 1 solicitation in July 2024, which includes the impacts of higher load growth forecasts on the 2029 to 2032 planning horizon. PSEG submitted a proposal into Window 1 for approximately 375 million. 
 PSEG will continue to evaluate opportunities to participate in transmission solicitation processes and may decide to submit bids for these opportunities, some of which could be material investments. 
 PSEG LI 
 In May 2024, LIPA issued requests for proposal for a service provider to operate its electrical transmission and distribution system and for power supply and fuel management services, respectively, upon expiry of the current service contracts with PSEG LI which run through December 31, 2025. PSEG has submitted proposals to continue as operations service provider for LIPA s electrical transmission and distribution system, and to continue to provide power supply and fuel management services to LIPA, in each case after the current contracts expire.

Our Net Income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 variances versus the comparable periods in 2023 were driven primarily by changes in the MTM and NDT Fund and the pension settlement charge recorded in 2023, as discussed above. 
 Regulatory, Legislative and Other Developments 
 We closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. 
 Transmission Rate Proceedings and Return on Equity (ROE) 
 Under current FERC rules, PSE G continues to earn a 50 basis point adder to its base ROE for its membership in PJM as a transmission owner. In April 2021, FERC proposed eliminating this ROE adder for Regional Transmission Owner participation. FERC has not acted on the proposal. If the adder was eliminated, it would reduce PSE G s annual Net Income and annual cash inflows by approximately 40 million. 
 New Jersey Stakeholder Proceedings 
 In February 2023, the governor of New Jersey issued executive orders (EOs) that establish or accelerate previously established 2050 targets for clean-sourced energy, building decarbonization, and EV adoption goals, with new target dates of 2030 or 2035, as applicable. The EOs direct the BPU and other state agencies to collaborate with stakeholders to develop plans to reach the targets and the BPU has convened a stakeholder proceeding to develop a plan for gas distribution utilities to reach the target of 50 natural gas emissions reductions over 2006 levels by 2030. The BPU commenced proceedings to update the State s EMP via public input hearings in May and June 2024. We are unable to predict the outcomes of this proceeding, but it could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 We are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs and penalties of remediating contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. In particular, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various statutes. In addition, PSEG Power has retained ownership of certain liabilities excluded from the sale of its fossil generation portfolio, primarily related to obligations under New Jersey and Connecticut state law to investigate and remediate the sites. We are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs and penalties of any such remediation efforts could be material. 
 For further information regarding the matters described above, as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1. Note 9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
 Nuclear 
 In April 2021, PSEG Power s Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants were awarded zero emission certificates (ZECs) for the three-year eligibility period starting June 2022 at the same approximate 10 per megawatt hour (MWh) received during the prior ZEC period through May 2022. Pursuant to a process established by the BPU, ZECs are purchased from selected nuclear plants and recovered through a non-bypassable distribution charge in the amount of 0.004 per kilowatt-hour used (which is equivalent to approximately 10 per MWh generated in payments to selected nuclear plants (ZEC payment)). As previously noted, in August 2022, the IRA was signed into law expanding incentives promoting carbon-free generation. The 
 61 

Table of Contents 

enacted legislation established a PTC for electricity generated using existing nuclear energy, which began January 1, 2024 and continues through 2032 and impacted PSEG Power's decision not to apply for the next ZEC three-year eligibility period starting June 2025. The expected PTC rate is up to 15/MWh subject to adjustment based upon a facility s gross receipts. The PTC rate and the gross receipts threshold are subject to annual inflation adjustments. The PTC amounts recorded to date are subject to change based on several factors, including but not limited to, adjustments to estimated market prices and generation and the issuance of authoritative guidance by Treasury/the Internal Revenue Service, including clarification of the definition of gross receipts used to determine the phase out. Any adjustments to amounts previously recorded could be material. We continue to analyze the impact of the IRA on our nuclear units, and will analyze any future guidance from the U.S. Treasury to assess any impact of PTCs on expected ZEC payments and/or any future ZEC application periods. 
 Interest Rate Matters 
 PSEG s long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities and support funding its capital program. Given our financing needs, the prevailing interest rate environment will be a key factor in determining interest expense on variable-rate debt and long-term rates on future financing plans. In order to increase the predictability of interest expense, we may use interest rate hedges to help limit our exposure to fluctuating interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, PSEG had entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate hedges totaling 1.25 billion in order to reduce the volatility in interest expense related to PSEG Power s variable rate term loan due March 2025. In addition, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedges to fix a portion of our interest rate exposure for anticipated long-term financing plans at PSEG and PSEG Power. PSE G s interest rate risk is moderated due to annual transmission rate filings and distribution recoveries through base rate filings and clause-based investment programs. 
 Tax Legislation 
 Future federal and state tax legislation and clarification of enacted legislation could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and cash tax position. 
 In April 2023, the U.S. Treasury issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15 that provides a safe harbor method of accounting to determine the annual repair tax deduction for gas T D property. The impact, if any, that this may have on PSEG and PSE G s financial statements has not yet been determined. 
 The IRA enacted a new 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT), which is based on adjusted financial statement income, a PTC for existing nuclear generation facilities and allows energy tax credits to be transferable. The U.S. Treasury has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining to the CAMT and final regulations pertaining to the prevailing wage requirements and transferability rules of energy tax credits. Many aspects of the IRA, including the CAMT proposed regulations, remain unclear and in need of further guidance; therefore, we continue to analyze the impact the IRA will have on PSEG s and PSE G s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which could be material. 
 Future Outlook 
 Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance, address regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and respond to the issues and challenges described below. In order to do this, we will continue to: 
 seek approval of and execute on our utility capital investment program to modernize our infrastructure, improve the reliability and resilience of the service we provide to our customers, and align our sustainability and climate goals with New Jersey s energy policy, 

seek a fair return for our T D investments through our transmission formula rate, existing rate incentives, distribution infrastructure and clean energy investment programs and periodic distribution base rate case proceedings, 

focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety, reliability and customer satisfaction and complying with applicable standards and requirements, 

manage the risks and opportunities in federal and state clean energy policies, 

advocate for appropriate regulatory guidance on the federal nuclear PTC to ensure long-term support for New Jersey s largest carbon-free generation resource, and adapt our hedging program accordingly, 

62 

Table of Contents 

engage constructively with our multiple stakeholders, including regulators, government officials, customers, employees, investors, suppliers and the communities in which we do business, and 

deliver on our human capital management strategy to attract, develop and retain a diverse, high-performing workforce. 

In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for 2024 and beyond, the key issues and challenges we expect our business to confront include: 
 regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to transmission planning and rates policy, the role of distribution utilities and decarbonization impacts, future energy policy, tax regulations, design of energy and capacity markets, and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceedings, 

performance of the financial markets, including the impact on our pension funding requirements and interest rates on our future financing plans, 

continuing to manage costs and maintain affordable customer rates in an inflationary environment, which could impact customer collections and future regulatory proceedings, 

the increasing frequency, sophistication and magnitude of cybersecurity attacks against us and our respective vendors and business partners who may have our sensitive information and/or access to our environment, and the increasing frequency and magnitude of physical attacks on electric and gas infrastructure, 

future changes in federal and state tax laws or any other associated tax guidance, and 

the impact of changes in energy demand, natural gas and electricity prices, PJM s challenge to ensure resource adequacy to meet demand growth, and expanded efforts to decarbonize several sectors of the economy. 

We continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term shareholder value and address the interests of our multiple stakeholders. We consider a wide variety of factors when determining how and when to efficiently deploy capital, including the performance and prospects of our businesses; returns and the sustainability and predictability of future earnings streams; the views of investors, regulators, public policy initiatives, rating agencies, customers and employees; our existing indebtedness and restrictions it imposes; and tax considerations, among other things. Strategic options available to us include: 
 investments in PSE G, including T D facilities to enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize the system to meet the growing needs and increasingly higher expectations of customers, and clean energy investments such as CEF-EE, CEF-EV, CEF-ES and solar, 

continued operation of our nuclear generation facilities that are expected to be supported by the PTC through 2032 and can enable certain investments to increase the capacity of the units as well as potential license extensions, transition from an 18-month to 24-month refueling cycle at our Hope Creek facility and offtake contracts with potential customers such as data centers and hydrogen producers, and others seeking reliable, around-the-clock carbon-free power,

Income Tax Expense decreased 338 million due primarily to lower pre-tax income in 2024 and the benefit from Nuclear PTCs. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPIT AL RESOURCES 
 The following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries. 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 We continue to expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating cash flow decreased 1,330 million, as compared to the same period in 2023. The net decrease was primarily due to an outflow of 3 million in net cash collateral postings in 2024 as compared to a 1,175 million inflow in 2023 at PSEG Power, partially offset by a net change at PSE G, as discussed below. 
 PSE G 
 PSE G s operating cash flow increased 167 million from 952 million to 1,119 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due primarily to the absence of returning cash collateral postings in 2024, which had been returned to BGS suppliers in 2023, and lower tax payments in 2024, partially offset by lower accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due primarily to lower gas commodity prices, a net increase in regulatory deferrals, and an increase in vendor and electric energy payments. 
 Short-Term Liquidity 
 PSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of PSEG Power, primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and, from time to time, short-term loans. PSE G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facility. 
 Each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries liquidity needs. 
 Our total committed credit facilities and available liquidity as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:

PSEG Power has uncommitted credit facilities totaling 200 million, which can be utilized for letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, PSEG Power had 75 million in letters of credit outstanding under these uncommitted credit facilities. In addition, a subsidiary of PSEG Power has an uncommitted credit facility for 150 million, which can be utilized for cash collateral postings. 
 We continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements, including to satisfy any additional collateral requirements. As of September 30, 2024, our liquidity position, including our credit facilities and access to external financing, was expected to be sufficient to meet our projected stressed requirements over our 12-month planning horizon. PSEG analyzes its liquidity requirements using stress scenarios that consider different events, including changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of PSEG Power losing its investment grade credit rating from S P or Moody s, which would represent a two-level downgrade from its current Moody s and S P ratings. In the event of a deterioration of PSEG Power s credit rating, certain of PSEG Power s agreements allow the counterparty to demand further

performance assurance. The potential additional collateral that we would be required to post under these agreements if PSEG Power were to lose its investment grade credit rating was approximately 705 million and 751 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 For additional information, see Item 1. Note 10. Debt and Credit Facilities. 
 Long-Term Debt Financing 
 During the next twelve months, 
 PSEG has 550 million of 0.80 Senior Notes maturing in August 2025, 

PSE G has 250 million of 3.05 Secured Medium-Term Notes, Series J, due November 2024, 

PSE G has 350 million of 3.00 Secured Medium-Term Notes Series K, due May 2025, and 

PSEG Power has 1.25 billion of a variable rate term loan due March 2025. 

PSEG, PSEG Power, Energy Holdings, PSEG LI and Services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs, which are accounted for as intercompany loans. Servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. Servco s short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by LIPA. 
 For additional information see Item 1. Note 10. Debt and Credit Facilities. 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 On July 15, 2024, PSEG s Board of Directors approved a 0.60 per share common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2024. This reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of 2.40 per share. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. For additional information related to cash dividends on our common stock, see Item 1. Note 16. Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Dividends. 
 Credit Ratings 
 If the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. Credit Ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. Outlooks are shown for the credit ratings at each entity and can be Stable, Negative, or Positive. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.

(B) S P ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest) for long-term securities and A1 (highest) to D (lowest) for short-term securities. 

CAPITAL RE QUIREMENTS 
 We expect that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. There were no material changes to our projected capital expenditures as compared to amounts disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 PSE G 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PSE G made capital expenditures of 2,157 million, primarily for T D system reliability and advanced electric metering. In addition, PSE G had cost of removal, net of salvage, of 137 million associated with capital replacements, and expenditures for EE programs of 393 million, which are included in operating cash flows. 
 PSEG Power Other 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PSEG Power Other made capital expenditures of 180 million, excluding 65 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various nuclear projects at PSEG Power and various information technology projects at Services.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALI TATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The risk inherent in our market-risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is our policy to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with business plans and prudent practices. We have a Risk Management Committee comprised of executive officers who utilize a risk oversight function to ensure compliance with our corporate policies and risk management practices. 
 Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment. We have a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure. In the event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. 
 Commodity Contracts 
 The availability and price of energy-related commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, we enter into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps, treasury locks, and options with approved counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with physical sales and other services, help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity. 
 Value-at-Risk (VaR) Models 
 VaR represents the potential losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate VaR across our commodity businesses. 
 MTM VaR consists of MTM derivatives that are economic hedges. The calculation does not include market risks associated with activities that are subject to accrual accounting, primarily our generating facilities and some load-serving activities. 
 The VaR models used are variance/covariance models adjusted for the change of positions with 95 and 99.5 confidence levels and a one-day holding period for the MTM activities. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods; however, we actively manage our portfolio. 
 From July through September 2024, MTM VaR varied between a low of 32 million and a high of 57 million at the 95 confidence level. The range of VaR was narrower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS A ND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 PSEG and PSE G 
 We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported and is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of each respective company, as appropriate, by others within the entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have established a disclosure committee which includes several key management employees and which reports directly to the CFO and CEO of each of PSEG and PSE G. The committee monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures. The CFO and CEO of each of PSEG and PSE G have evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures and, based on this evaluation, have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures at each respective company were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by the report. 
 Internal Controls 
 PSEG and PSE G 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, each registrant s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFOR MATION 
 ITEM 1.	LEGAL PROC EEDINGS 
 We are party to various lawsuits and environmental and regulatory matters, including in the ordinary course of business. For information regarding material legal proceedings, including updates to information reported in Item 3 of Part I of the Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1. Note 9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 ITEM 1A.	RISK FA CTORS 
 The discussion of our business and operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read together with the risk factors contained in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K which describes various risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed elsewhere in this report. 
 If we are unable to enter into or extend certain significant contracts on terms acceptable to us, this may negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 We are party to, and are also exploring opportunities to enter into, several contracts from which we currently or may in the future derive significant revenues. PSEG Power sells wholesale natural gas, primarily through a full-requirements BGSS contract with PSE G to meet the needs of PSE G s default gas supply service customers. In 2022, the BPU approved an extension of the long-term BGSS contract to March 31, 2027, and thereafter the contract remains in effect unless terminated by either party with a two-year notice. PSEG LI has an OSA with LIPA to operate LIPA s electric T D system in Long Island. The OSA continues through 2025, but can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Further, PSEG Power provides fuel procurement and power management services to LIPA under separate agreements that expire at the end of 2025. It is uncertain whether any of these contracts and agreements will be extended on terms acceptable to us or at all, which may negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, we are exploring opportunities for the potential sale of power from our nuclear facilities pursuant to long-term agreements with large power users, such as data centers and hydrogen producers. It is uncertain whether we will be successful in entering into any of such contracts on terms acceptable to us or at all, including without limitation in connection with various ongoing regulatory proceedings. 
 ITEM 5.	OTHER INF ORMATION 
 Certain information is provided below for new matters that have arisen subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K and the first and second quarter 2024 10-Q. 
 or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading plan for the sale of PSEG common stock.

Federal Regulation 
 Regulation of Wholesale Sales Generation/Market Issues/Market Power 
 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K page 10, March 31, 2024 Form 10-Q page 64 and June 30, 2024 Form 10-Q page 71. In October 2024, FERC issued a Final Rule that eliminates compensation for reactive power in circumstances when the generator is operating within the normal power factor range specified in its interconnection agreement. As PJM will need to submit a compliance filing implementing this Final Rule, the timing of loss of reactive power compensation is uncertain and its impact will be prospective only. PSEG Power currently receives reactive power compensation, and we are analyzing the Final Rule to determine its impacts for us. 
 In addition, there are several ongoing proceedings at FERC that may impact future data center arrangements involving the supply of power from nuclear units, including whether certain data center customers, depending on their configuration, will pay transmission service charges. On November 1, 2024, FERC issued an order rejecting an amended agreement between Talen Energy (Talen), PJM and PPL Electric Utilities that would have permitted Talen to withdraw incremental power from one of its nuclear units beyond previous approvals to provide power to an adjacent data center. FERC is also more broadly examining issues concerning whether and to what extent there are potential reliability, cost and customer impacts raised by the location of large customers at generating facilities. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. 
 Capacity Market Issues 
 In September 2024, several parties filed a complaint at FERC alleging that the PJM capacity market design is unjust and unreasonable because it does not properly reflect the reliability contribution of retiring generating units with contractual commitments to continue to run for a defined period of time. In October 2024, PJM issued a notice stating that it intends to ask FERC for authorization to delay the 2026/2027 Base Residual Auction, which is scheduled for December 2024, by approximately six months so PJM has adequate time to discuss with its members potential changes to capacity market rules that could be submitted to FERC in a future filing. Depending upon the changes that PJM proposes and subsequent FERC action, such changes could affect the capacity revenue that generators receive for the 2026/2027 delivery year and future delivery years. 
 Compliance Reliability Standards 
 In September 2024, FERC proposed changes to NERC s Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards. First, FERC proposed to approve the creation of a new CIP standard that requires entities to expand their efforts to monitor for malicious cyber activity. Second, FERC directed NERC to modify the supply chain standard to ensure that entities properly identify, assess and respond to risks in their supply chain risk plans, including setting maximum time frames between conducting a risk assessment and installing procured equipment. FERC also directed NERC to modify the supply chain standard to expand the type of equipment subject to the supply chain protections. 
 State Regulation 
 Regional Energy Access (REA) Expansion Project 
 In September 2024, the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated FERC approval of the REA Expansion Project, which involves a natural gas pipeline running through New Jersey and several other states, and in which PSEG Energy Resources Trade, LLC, the provider of gas supplies to satisfy PSE G s BGSS customers, is a participant. The court found that FERC failed to properly consider the environmental consequences of the project, and the alleged lack of market demand for additional natural gas capacity in New Jersey. PSEG is monitoring and evaluating this on-going proceeding, which could impact FERC s analysis of future gas projects, as well as PSE G s acquisition of supplies for and provision of Basic Gas Supply Service. 
 BGS Process 
 In June 2024, New Jersey s EDCs, including PSE G, filed their annual joint proposal for the conduct of the February 2025 BGS auction covering energy years 2026 through 2028. PSE G s company-specific addendum to the joint filing includes a proposal for an optional, two-year pilot program for time-of-use rates for residential customers.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Activity 
 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K, page 13. In June 2021, the BPU issued an initial straw proposal, and in December 2022 issued a revised straw proposal, for the establishment of an EV infrastructure ecosystem for medium- and heavy-duty EVs in New Jersey. In October 2024, the BPU released an Order that provided program guidance and minimum filing requirements for electric utility operated medium- and heavy-duty charging incentive programs. The Order caps PSE G s program investment at 30 million and requires electric utilities to submit program filings by February 20, 2025. 
 Grid Modernization 
 December 31, 2023 Form 10-K page 13 . In June 2022, following a consultant study, the BPU Staff issued a grid modernization report containing findings and recommendations to update the BPU s interconnection regulations and processes. In furtherance of the recommendations, in June 2024 the BPU published proposed rules for public comment that amend its interconnection rules to speed up the interconnection of renewable resources to the distribution grid. Separately, in July 2024, BPU Staff convened a working group to develop recommendations for integrated distribution planning for distributed energy resources as part of its grid modernization plan. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Hazardous Substance Liability 
 Pursuant to the 2022 Dirty Dirt legislation, the NJDEP is proposing new requirements for the transportation, handling and disposal of soil and other waste materials generated by utility companies, including PSE G. NJDEP has not yet finalized the requirements and, therefore, PSE G is unable to quantify the increased costs of complying with these potential new requirements.
