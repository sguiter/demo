FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, 
 estimate, expect, intend, may, might, objective, 
 ongoing, plan, potential, predict, project, should, 
 will and would, or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions intended to identify statements
about the future. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events
and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements
include, without limitation, statements about: 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, revenue, capital requirements and timing and availability of and the need for additional financing
 will almost certainly not match actual amounts and timing; 

our
 ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months; 

the
 risk that our lead product candidate PF614 and PF614-MPAR may not be successful in limiting or impeding abuse, overdose, or misuse
 or providing additional safety upon commercialization; 

the
 need for substantial additional funding to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates; 

the
 risk that our clinical trials may fail to replicate positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted
 by us or third parties; 

the
 risk that the potential product candidates that we develop may not progress through clinical development or receive required regulatory
 approvals within expected timelines or at all; 

the
 risk that clinical trials may not confirm any safety, potency, or other product characteristics described or assumed in this Quarterly
 Report on Form 10-Q; 

the
 risk that we will be unable to successfully market or gain market acceptance of our product candidates; 

the
 risk that our product candidates may not be beneficial to patients or successfully commercialized; 

the
 risk that we have overestimated the size of the target market, patients willingness to try new therapies, and the willingness
 of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 

effects
 of competition; 

i 

the
 risk that third parties on which we depend for laboratory, clinical development, manufacturing, and other critical services will
 fail to perform satisfactorily; 

the
 risk that we will be unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for its investigational products or
 will infringe the intellectual property protection of others; 

the
 loss of key members of our management team; 

changes
 in our regulatory environment; 

the
 ability to attract and retain key scientific, medical, commercial, or management personnel; 

changes
 in our industry; 

our
 ability to remediate any material weaknesses or establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; 

the
 risk that our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq; 

The
 risk that we may not be able to regain or maintain compliance with applicable listing standards of Nasdaq; 

other
 factors disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; and 

other
 factors beyond our control. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on Ensysce s current expectations and beliefs
concerning future developments and their potential effects on Ensysce. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Ensysce
will be those that Ensysce has anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond Ensysce s
control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied
by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the
heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions
prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Moreover, the
occurrence of the events described in the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K may adversely affect Ensysce.
Ensysce will not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,

2020, the Company commenced an initiative to develop a therapeutic for the treatment of certain coronavirus infections through the formation
of a separate entity, EBIR, a Delaware corporation. Pursuant to the certificate of incorporation, EBIR was authorized to issue 
shares of common stock, par value per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value per share. Ensysce is a 
stockholder in EBIR, with and of the shares held by a certain key person of the Company and two unrelated parties, respectively.
The non-Ensysce owned shares and the activity are reflected on the financial statements as Noncontrolling interests. 

The
Company currently operates in one business segment, which is pharmaceuticals. The Company is not organized by market and is managed and
operated as one business. A single management team reports to the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer. 

While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to ultimately realize revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, management
cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company s ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain adequate financing and achieve profitable operations. As a result, these plans
do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months following
the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.

Warrants 

The
Company issued liability-classified warrants in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes and the 2022 Notes. The warrants were
liability-classified due to certain cash settlement features and included in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets. The Company uses a Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of the warrants by using assumptions within the model
for the expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. Changes in the fair value of the warrants are
recognized in other income (expense) for each reporting period. Refer to Note 8 for details of the warrants.

Federal
Grants 

In
September 2018, the National Institutes of Health NIH through the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA awarded the Company a research and development grant related to the development of its MPAR overdose prevention technology
(the MPAR Grant ). The initial grant was extended several times and cumulative funding under this grant of approximately
 million was completed in December 2023. A new multi-year MPAR Grant was awarded by NIH through NIDA in August 2024, providing funding
of million through May 2027. 

In
September 2019, the NIH/NIDA awarded the Company a second research and development grant related to the development of its TAAP/MPAR
abuse deterrent technology for Opioid Use Disorder (the OUD Grant ). The total approved budget was approximately million,
and the grant period ended August 31, 2024. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when costs related to the grants are incurred and assessed as reimbursable. The Company believes this policy
is consistent with the overarching premise in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), applied by analogy, to ensure that it recognizes revenues to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services,
even though there is no exchange as defined in ASC 606. The Company believes the recognition of revenue as costs are incurred
and reimbursable amounts become due is analogous to the concept of transfer of control of a service over time under ASC 606.

for multi-year pre-clinical and clinical research studies. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding,
the terms generally allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust its requirements based on its business needs prior
to the delivery of goods or the performance of services. 

Litigation 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were no pending legal proceedings against the Company that are expected to have a
material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, the Company could become involved
in disputes and various litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. These may include disputes and lawsuits related
to intellectual property, licensing, contract law and employee relations matters. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of significant
matters, if any exist, and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal claim is considered
probable and the amount can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties,
and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on the best information available at the
time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation.

Notes

per share in the aggregate. At the second closing under the SPA, which occurred on November 29, 2023, the Company issued to the investors
referenced above, (i) additional notes in the aggregate principal amount of for an aggregate purchase price of 
and (ii) additional warrants to purchase shares of the common stock in the aggregate. 

The
Company reflected the outstanding principal amount, the remaining unamortized discount (both original issue discount and the relative
fair value discount associated with the warrants discussed below) and the remaining debt issuance costs as a net amount on the face of
the balance sheet. The amortization of the original debt discount (approximately million) and issuance costs (approximately 
million) were recorded as interest expense within the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the original debt
discount and issuance costs were fully amortized to interest expense. 

The
warrants have an exercise price of , the same as the conversion price, and are exercisable for five years following the issuance
date. The warrants were equity classified as they are indexed to the Company s stock and only settleable in shares. The warrants
were initially measured at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model and were allocated along with the 2023 Notes using the relative
fair value method. The initial fair value of million allocated to the warrants was considered a debt discount and was amortized
to interest expense over the remaining term of the notes. As of September 30, 2024, the discount associated with the warrants was fully
amortized to interest expense. 

During
2024, the Company converted shares of common stock with a conversion value of million related to the 2023 Notes. In addition,

8) to pay down million of the 2023 Notes and incurred million in transaction costs recorded as such in the consolidated statement
of stockholders equity. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount of the 2023 Notes relates to senior secured convertible
promissory notes held by a Company board member (see Note 10).

Series B Warrants have an exercise price of per share and will expire on . The gross proceeds to the Company from the
exercise of the warrants were approximately million, prior to deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. As
the existing warrants and the new warrants were equity classified before and after the exchange, and as the exchange is directly attributable
to an equity offering, the Company recognized the effect of the modification of approximately million as an equity issuance cost. 

In
connection with the execution of the Inducement Letter, the Company executed a waiver related to the 2023 Notes SPA it had entered
as of October 23, 2023. The SPA contained restrictions on the Company s ability to undertake certain transactions, which included
the execution of the Inducement Letter. The Waiver permitted the Company to execute the Inducement Letter but required repayment of the
certain investor held notes issued under the SPA with a premium following closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 7 for the details
of the waiver fee and the application of the amounts to the outstanding 2023 Notes and as a transaction cost of the warrant inducement. 

The

price of per share, at a reduced exercise price of per share. The Company also agreed to amend certain existing warrants
to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock that were previously issued in November 2023 and have an exercise
price of per share such that the amended warrants will have a reduced exercise price of per share effective upon the closing
of the offering and will be exercisable from the date on which stockholder approval is received with respect to the issuance of the shares
of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. As the existing November 2023 and February 2024 warrants and their related newly
issued warrants upon inducement were equity classified before and after the exchange, and as the exchange is directly attributable to
an equity offering, the Company recognized the effect of the modification of approximately million as an equity issuance cost. 

In

Option
Valuation 

The
fair value of each stock option granted has been determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The material assumptions used
in the Black-Scholes model in estimating the fair value of the options granted for the periods presented were as follows (there were
no grants issued in during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023): 

Expected
 stock-price volatility. The expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of publicly traded companies within
 the Company s industry that the Company considers to be comparable to the Company s business over a period approximately
 equal to the expected term. 

Expected
 term. The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company s
 historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term due to a
 lack of sufficient data. Therefore, the Company estimates the expected term for employees by using the simplified method provided
 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting
 and the contractual life of the options. 

Risk-free
 interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon
 U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term. 

Expected
 dividend yield. The expected dividend is assumed to be zero as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans
 to pay any dividends on the Company s common stock. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate of of unrecognized share-based compensation cost, which is expected to be
recognized over the weighted average period of years.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis provide information which our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of
our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this
report. In addition to historical financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the section within Part II-Other Information - titled Item 1A. Risk
Factors. 

References
in the following discussion to we , us , our and the Company refer to Ensysce Biosciences,
Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries following the Closing of the Business Combination. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
to LACQ refer to Leisure Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, prior to the Closing. 

Overview 

Ensysce
is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative solutions for severe pain relief while reducing the potential for opioid
abuse and overdose. Our lead product candidate, PF614, is an extended release TAAP prodrug of oxycodone. TAAP modification of prescription
drugs removes the ability to crush, chew or manipulate and inject to achieve the effect of the medication more quickly than by swallowing.
Our MPAR technology adds a layer of overdose protection to each TAAP product. 

Since
our inception in 2003, we devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to organizing and staffing our company, business
planning, raising capital, discovering product candidates and securing related intellectual property rights and conducting research and
development activities for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and we have not generated any revenue
from product sales. We may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product. 

Our
lead product candidate, PF614, is ready for Phase 3 clinical development, PF614-MPAR is in Phase 1b clinical development and nafamostat
has completed Phase 1 clinical development. Our other product candidates and our research initiatives are in preclinical or earlier stages
of development. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful
development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We have not yet successfully completed any pivotal
clinical trials, nor have we obtained any regulatory approvals, manufactured a commercial-scale drug, or conducted sales and marketing
activities. 

We
have incurred significant operating losses since inception and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that
our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly
if and as we: 

continue
 preclinical studies and continues existing and initiates new clinical trials for PF614, PF614-MPAR and nafamostat, our lead product
 candidates being tested for chronic pain and infectious disease; 

advance
 the development of our product candidate pipeline of other product candidates, including through business development efforts to
 invest in or in-license other technologies or product candidates; 

maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire
 additional clinical, quality control, medical, scientific and other technical personnel to support our clinical operations; 

seek
 regulatory approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

undertake
 any pre-commercialization activities to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which
 we may receive regulatory approval; 

expand
 our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate our growing employee base; and 

add
 operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our research and development
 programs and any future commercialization efforts. 

17 

We
have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting,
insurance, investor relations and other expenses. We may never become profitable. 

We
require substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can generate significant
revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of private and public equity offerings,
debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. To the
extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of private or public equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership
interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights
of our equity holders. 

Debt
financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability
to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we
raise additional funds through collaborations or other strategic transactions with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable
rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be
favorable to us. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable
terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale
back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential
in-licenses or acquisitions. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased
expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we generate product sales, we may not become profitable.
If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations
at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 

We
have generated limited revenues, have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur operating
losses for the foreseeable future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future
viability is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to finance our operations. 

We
expect to incur substantial expenses in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates
and ongoing internal research and development programs. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing, or aggregate
amount of costs for our development, potential commercialization, and internal research and development programs. However, in order to
complete our current and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, and to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval
for our product candidates, as well as to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary
to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we may require substantial additional funding in the future. 

2024
February Warrant Inducement 

In
February 2024, the Company entered into an Inducement Letter with certain holders of existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate
of 3,601,752 shares of the Company s common stock issued to the holders in connection with the 2023 May Offering. Pursuant to the

entered into as of October 23, 2023. The SPA contained restrictions on the Company s ability to undertake certain transactions,
which included entering into the Inducement Letter. The Waiver permitted the Company to enter into the Inducement Letter but required
repayment of the remaining 0.5 million of investor held notes issued under the SPA with a premium of 0.5 million following closing
of the inducement transaction.

Company utilized an exclusive placement agent for the 2024 Warrant Inducement and incurred approximately 0.3 million in legal fees and
other closing costs. Additionally, the Company issued to the placement agent as compensation unregistered warrants to purchase up to

the reduced exercise price per Existing Warrant). 

2024
Registered Direct Offering and 2024 August Warrant Inducement 

In
August 2024, the Company entered into a definitive Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which
the Company agreed to issue and sell in a registered direct offering, (i) an aggregate of 2,490,798 shares of common stock of the Company,
par value 0.0001 per share at an offering price of 0.47 per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,062,396 shares of Common

million before the deduction of placement agent fees and offering expenses. The pre-funded warrants were subsequently exercised in full
and were not outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company also entered into an inducement agreement with certain warrant holders for the exercise of certain outstanding warrants to purchase
up to an aggregate of 7,203,504 shares of common stock of the Company originally issued in February 2024, having an exercise price of
 1.06 per share, at a reduced exercise price of 0.47 per share. The Company also agreed to amend certain existing warrants to purchase
up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock that were previously issued in November 2023 and have an exercise price of 1.5675
per share such that the amended warrants will have a reduced exercise price of 0.47 per share effective upon the closing of the offering
and will be exercisable from the date on which stockholder approval is received with respect to the issuance of the shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. 

In
a concurrent private placement, pursuant to the terms of the inducement agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company also

from the commencement of sales in the Offerings. 

Components
of Our Operating Results 

Revenue 

We
have generated limited revenue since our inception and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near
future, if at all. If our development efforts are successful and we commercialize our products, or if we enter into collaboration or
license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, as well as upfront, milestone and royalty
payments from such collaboration or license agreements, or a combination thereof. 

We
have received funding under federal grants from the NIH through NIDA. In September 2018 and August 2024, we were awarded research and
development grants related to the development of our MPAR overdose prevention technology. In September 2019, we were awarded a second
research and development grant related to the development of our TAAP/MPAR abuse deterrent technology for Opioid Use Disorder OUD ).
Grant funds are awarded annually through a Notice of Award which contains certain terms and conditions including, but not limited to,
complying with the grant program legislation, regulation and policy requirements, complying with conditions on expenditures of funds
with respect to other applicable statutory requirements such as the federal appropriations acts, periodic reporting requirements, and
budget requirements. 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for research activities, including drug discovery efforts and the development
of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, which include: 

expenses
 incurred to conduct the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval; 

expenses
 incurred under agreements with CROs that are primarily engaged in the oversight and conduct of our drug discovery efforts and preclinical
 studies, clinical trials and CMOs that are primarily engaged to provide preclinical and clinical drug substance and product for our
 research and development programs; 

other
 costs related to acquiring and manufacturing materials in connection with our drug discovery efforts and preclinical studies and
 clinical trial materials, including manufacturing validation batches, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct
 our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services; 

payments
 made in cash or equity securities under third-party licensing, acquisition and option agreements; 

employee-related
 expenses, including salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development
 functions; 

costs
 related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and 

allocated
 facilities-related costs, depreciation and other expenses, which include rent and utilities. 

19 

We
recognize external development costs as incurred. Any advance payments we make for goods or services to be received in the future for
use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered
or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered, or the services rendered.
We estimate and accrue for the value of goods and services received from CROs and certain other third parties each reporting period based
on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers. This process
involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed
on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been
invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. 

We
do not track our research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis. Our direct external research and development expenses
consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, CMOs and research laboratories in connection with
our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. We do not allocate employee costs,
costs associated with our discovery efforts, laboratory supplies, and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to
specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal
resources primarily to manage our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. These
employees work across multiple programs and, therefore, we do not track our costs by program and cannot state precisely the total costs
incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical programs on a project-by-project basis. 

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have
higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage
clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will remain elevated as we continue our existing,
and commence additional, planned clinical trials for PF614, PF614-MPAR and nafamostat, as well as conduct other preclinical and clinical
development, including submitting regulatory filings for our other product candidates, subject to our ability to obtain financing. We
also expect our related personnel costs to increase and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses, including costs
associated with stock-based compensation, to remain elevated. In addition, we may incur additional expenses related to milestone and
royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we may enter license, acquisition and option agreements to acquire the rights to
future product candidates. 

At
this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical
and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our product
candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates are highly uncertain. This uncertainty is due
to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of the following: 

the
 scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development
 activities; 

establishing
 an appropriate safety and efficacy profile with investigational new drug IND enabling studies; 

successful
 patient enrollment in and the initiation and completion of clinical trials; 

the
 timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and non-U.S. regulators; 

the
 extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing
 clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that
 we or our third-party manufacturers are able to make product successfully; 

20 

development
 and timely delivery of clinical-grade and commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial
 launch; 

obtaining,
 maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

significant
 and changing government regulation; 

launching
 commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

maintaining
 a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates following approval, if any, of our product candidates. 

Any
changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical
development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For
example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical
trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned
clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development
of that product candidate. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries and related benefits, travel and stock-based
compensation for personnel in executive, business development, finance, human resources, legal, information technology, and administrative
functions. General and administrative expenses also include insurance costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor
and public relations, accounting and audit services. We expense general and administrative costs as incurred. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support the continued
development of our product candidates, subject to our ability to obtain financing. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur
significant accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public
relations expenses. Additionally, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an
increase in payroll and other employee-related expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates
to the sales and marketing of that product candidate. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Change
in fair value of convertible notes 

The
2022 Notes were accounted for under ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, due to share settlement features contained
within the notes. We used a discounted cash flow model and a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of the notes, both of
which rely on unobservable Level 3 inputs. Changes in the fair value of the notes are recognized through earnings for each reporting
period. 

21 

Change
in fair value of liability classified warrants 

We
use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the liability classified warrants. Changes in the fair value of
the warrants are recognized through earnings for each reporting period. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense consists of interest accrued on our financed directors and officers insurance, and accumulated interest from the
2023 Notes based on the stated interest rate. In addition, the 2023 Notes balances reflect amortization of the debt discount from the
original issuance and a discount associated with the warrant issuances and amortization of the associated debt issuance costs that are
all recorded as interest expense. Interest expense related to the 2022 Notes was included in the estimate of fair value of the convertible
notes. 

Provision
for Income Taxes 

We
have not recorded any significant amounts related to income tax expense, we have not recognized any reserves related to uncertain tax
positions, nor have we recorded any income tax benefits for the majority of our net losses we have incurred to date or for our research
and development tax credits. 

We
account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or our tax returns. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing
assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards, which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect in the
years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income, the amount and timing of which are uncertain. Valuation allowances are provided, if, based upon the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets based on our evaluation
of all available evidence. 

Beginning
in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and
requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. This has
not impacted our effective tax rate or our cash tax payable in 2024; however, if the requirement to capitalize Section 174 expenditures
is not modified, it may also impact our effective tax rate and our cash tax liability in future years. 

We
file income tax returns in the United States federal tax jurisdiction and state jurisdictions and may become subject to income tax audit
and adjustments by related tax authorities. Our tax return period for United States federal income taxes for the tax years since 2020
remain open to examination under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and state jurisdictions. We record reserves
for potential tax payments to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions, if any. The nature of uncertain tax positions
is subject to significant judgment by management and subject to change, which may be substantial. These reserves are based on a determination
of whether and how much a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or whether our position is more likely than not to be realized following
the resolution of any potential contingencies related to the tax benefit. We develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions, and the
associated cumulative probabilities, using internal expertise and assistance from third-party experts. As additional information becomes
available, estimates are revised and refined. Differences between estimates and final settlement may occur resulting in additional tax
expense. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of our provision for
income taxes. To date, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.

Federal
grant funding 

Funding
from federal grants for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 3.4 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The increase
is due to the timing of research activities eligible for funding, with increased activities under the OUD grant following the selection
of a lead drug candidate in June 2024 and funding under the newly awarded MPAR grant commencing in September 2024. We expect revenue
from federal grants to decrease in coming quarters due to the completion of the OUD grant in August 2024 and the timing of research activities
under the MPAR grant. 

Research
and development expenses 

Research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.7 million and 1.9 million, respectively, representing
a decrease of 0.2 million. The decrease was primarily the result of reduced external research and development costs related to clinical
and pre-clinical programs for PF614 and PF614-MPAR. We do not currently track expenses on a program-by-program basis. We expect future
research and development expenses to increase from current levels with the availability of funding from the new MPAR grant. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 1.1 million and 1.2 million, respectively,
representing an decrease of 0.1 million. We expect future general and administrative expenses to approximate current levels. 

Other
income and expense 

Other
income and expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisted primarily of interest income from cash and cash equivalents.
The comparative period for 2023 consisted primarily of changes in fair value associated with the Company s liability-classified
warrants.

24 

Liquidity
and capital resources 

Sources
of liquidity and capital 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Since inception, we have generated limited revenues and have
incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses
for the foreseeable future. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from
sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. 

We
have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of common equity, funding under federal research grants and
borrowings under convertible promissory notes. To fund future operations, we will need to raise additional capital. The amount and timing
of future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and results of our ongoing research and development
efforts and related general and administrative support. We anticipate that we will fund our operations through public or private equity
or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements. We cannot make assurances that anticipated additional
financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. 

The
remaining cash funding under the MPAR federal research grant totaled 14 million at September 30, 2024 and is expected to be utilized
by May 31, 2027. Pursuant to the terms and conditions, we are required to submit progress reports to NIDA on an annual basis and a final
research performance progress report within 120 days of the performance period end date. 

Going
Concern 

We
have generated limited revenues and have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur significant
expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Without capital raised through financing transactions, existing cash resources
are sufficient to allow us to fund current planned operations into the first quarter of 2025, which raises substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Cash
flows 

The
following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented:

 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 3,029,988 
 (1,683,321 

Operating
activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used cash in operating activities of 6.7 million and 9.0 million, respectively.
The decrease primarily resulted from the timing of vendor invoicing and payments and a reduction in research and development activities
in the 2024 period. 

Financing
activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 9.8 million, primarily consisting of net proceeds
from the August 2024 public offering 1.7 million, warrant exercises and the warrant inducement, net transaction costs 8.9 million,
less repayment of convertible notes of 0.5 million and financed insurance premiums of 0.3 million. During the nine months ended September
30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 7.3 million, primarily consisting of proceeds from 2023 February and 2023 May
offerings of 9.1 million, net of transaction costs of 0.4 million and the repayment of financed insurance premiums of 0.3 million
and cash payment of 2022 Notes of 1.0 million. 

25 

Funding
requirements 

Our
primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, primarily related to our research and development activities. Cash used to fund operating
expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued
expenses and prepaid expenses. 

We
expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities
and clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, additional costs associated
with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other expenses. The timing
and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on our ability to: 

advance
 preclinical development of our early-stage programs and clinical trials of our product candidates; 

manufacture,
 or have manufactured on our behalf, preclinical and clinical drug material and develop processes for late state and commercial manufacturing; 

seek
 regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

establish
 a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain
 marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own; 

hire
 additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; 

expand
 our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development,
 manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company; 

obtain,
 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

manage
 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights,
 including enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims; and 

manage
 the costs of operating as a public company. 

26 

Commitments 

Our
commitments as of September 30, 2024, included approximately 13.3 million related to open purchase orders and contractual obligations
that occurred in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract research organizations for multi-year pre-clinical
and clinical research studies. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow
us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or the performance
of services. 

Working
capital 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of biologic product candidates, we
are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could
increase significantly because of many factors, including: 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical and clinical
 trials; 

the
 costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

the
 costs, timing and ability to manufacture our product candidates to supply our clinical and preclinical development efforts and our
 clinical trials; 

the
 costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product
 candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

the
 costs of manufacturing commercial-grade product and necessary inventory to support commercial launch; 

the
 ability to receive additional non-dilutive funding, including grants from organizations and foundations; 

the
 revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; 

the
 costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining, expanding and enforcing our intellectual
 property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; and 

the
 extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies. 

27 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included
in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policy is the most critical to the judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Accrued
Research and Development Expenses 

As
part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development
expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify
services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the
service when it has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Many of our service providers invoice us in arrears
for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments.
We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances
known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and adjust if necessary. Examples
of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to: 

vendors,
 including research laboratories, in connection with preclinical development activities; 

CROs
 and investigative sites in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and 

CMOs
 in connection with drug substance and drug product formulation of preclinical studies and clinical trial materials. 

We
base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant
to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical
trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result
in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and
result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of
patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will
be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level
of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates
to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative
to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any
particular period. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have during the periods presented, and do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and
regulations of the SEC. 

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements 

A
description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact Ensysce s financial position and results of
operations is disclosed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Smaller
reporting company status 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage
of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We
will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held
by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such completed
fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30.

are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business, primarily related to changes in interest rates and inflation. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

Our
cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, consisted of cash and a money market fund account. Because of the short-term nature
of our money market fund, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations. 

Inflation
Risk 

We
do not believe that inflation and changing prices had a significant impact on our results of operations for any periods presented herein. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. Based
on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Management has concluded that our financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with GAAP for each of the periods presented therein. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we could become involved in disputes and various litigation matters that arise in the normal course of business. These
may include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, licensing, contract law and employee relations matters. Periodically,
we review the status of significant matters, if any exist, and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from
any claim or legal claim is considered probable and the amount can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal
proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based
on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related
to pending claims and litigation. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

While
we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical, under the circumstances,
some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K includes
a detailed discussion of our risk factors. Those risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our financial condition
and results of operations. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

August 28, 2024, in a private placement held concurrently with (i) a registered offering and (ii) an inducement offering to certain warrant
