Cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates. In the table above, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are shown in one period. Investment securities carried at at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023 were pledged as collateral for public deposits, trusts and certain other deposits as provided by law. See Note 8 for information concerning securities pledged to secure borrowing arrangements. A summary of information management considered in evaluating debt and equity securities for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is provided below. Debt Securities As reflected in the table above, gross unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale debt securities totaled at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not it will be required to sell, these securities before it is able to recover the amortized cost basis. The unrealized holding losses were consistent with increases in market interest rates that have occurred subsequent to the purchase of most of the securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management performed an assessment for possible credit losses of the Corporation s debt securities on an issue-by-issue basis, relying on information obtained from various sources, including publicly available financial data, ratings by external agencies, brokers and other sources. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Corporation s holdings of bank holding company debt securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and private label commercial mortgage-backed securities were investment grade and there have been no payment defaults. Based on the results of the assessment, there was allowance for credit losses ACL required on available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Equity Securities C N Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB-Pittsburgh), which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks.

 at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The Corporation evaluated its holding of FHLB-Pittsburgh stock for impairment and deemed the stock to not be impaired at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In making this determination, management concluded that recovery of total outstanding par value, which equals the carrying value, is expected. The decision was based on review of financial information that FHLB-Pittsburgh has made publicly available. In July 2023, C N Bank became a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a member, C N Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. There is no active market for Federal Reserve Bank stock, and it must ordinarily be redeemed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in order to be liquidated. C N Bank s investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The Corporation has a marketable equity security included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a carrying value of at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consisting exclusively of mutual fund. There was an unrealized loss on the mutual fund of at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023.

Under the risk rating system, the Corporation classifies problem or potential problem loans as Special Mention, Substandard, or Doubtful on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Loans that do not currently expose the Corporation to sufficient risk to warrant classification as Substandard or Doubtful, but possess weaknesses that deserve management s close attention, are deemed to be Special Mention. Substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Risk ratings are updated any time that conditions or the situation warrants. Loans not classified are included in the Pass rows in the table that follows.

The following table represents the accrued interest receivable written off by reversing interest income during the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Commercial real estate - owner occupied All other commercial loans Residential mortgage loans Consumer loans Total The Corporation has certain loans for which repayment is dependent upon the operation or sale of collateral, as the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The underlying collateral can vary based upon the type of loan. The following provides more detail about the types of collateral that secure collateral dependent loans: Commercial real estate loans can be secured by either owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner occupied investment commercial real estate. Typically, owner occupied commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other commercial and industrial properties occupied by operating companies. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office buildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial properties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate. All other commercial loans include loans typically secured by business assets including inventory, equipment and receivables. Also within this category, commercial construction and land loans and some commercial lines of credit are secured by real estate. Residential mortgage loans are typically secured by first mortgages, and in some cases could be secured by a second mortgage.

 Commercial real estate - owner occupied All other commercial loans Total Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses ACL on loans represents management s estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in loans as of the balance sheet date. The ACL on loans includes two primary components: (i) an allowance established on loans which share similar risk characteristics which are collectively evaluated for credit losses, and (ii) an allowance established on loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with any loan segment and which are individually evaluated for credit losses. Management determines the ACL on loans that are collectively evaluated by considering the following: (a) the weighted-average remaining maturity (WARM) method is used to estimate credit losses, based on the Corporation s historical loss experience, for pools of loans with similar risk and cash flow characteristics; (b) subjective adjustments are made, generally increasing the ACL, for qualitative risk factors that are deemed likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience; and (c) an additional adjustment to expected credit losses is made, based on an economic forecast, and applied for the first 2 years of the weighted-average remaining life of the portfolio.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Corporation made no modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The following table depicts the performance of loans which were in nonaccrual status at September 30, 2024 that were modified in the fourth quarter 2023: The loan that was current at September 30, 2024 matured October 5, 2024, and the Corporation and borrower are engaged in negotiations regarding an extension of the loan term.

The pricing service uses pricing models that vary based on asset class and incorporate available market information, including quoted prices of investment securities with similar characteristics. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, pricing models use available information, as applicable, through processes such as benchmark yield curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Derivative instruments - Interest rate SWAP agreements, RPA Out and RPA In - The fair value of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date, valued by a third-party pricing service using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs include prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, estimates of current and potential future credit exposure and calculated discounted cash flow factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Management s evaluation and selection of valuation techniques and the unobservable inputs used in determining the fair values of assets valued using Level 3 methodologies include sensitive assumptions. Other market participants might use substantially different assumptions, which could result in calculations of fair values that would be substantially different than the amount calculated by management.

Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The presentation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) on loans. The Corporation maintains an ACL on loans which represents management s estimate of expected net charge-offs over the life of the loans. The ACL includes two primary components: (i) an allowance established on loans which share similar risk characteristics collectively evaluated for credit losses (collective basis), and (ii) an allowance established on loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with any loan segment and which are individually evaluated for credit losses (individual basis). Management considers the determination of the ACL on loans to be critical because it requires significant judgment regarding estimates of expected credit losses based on the Corporation s historical loss experience, current conditions and economic forecasts. Management s evaluation is based upon a continuous review of the Corporation s loans, with consideration given to evaluations resulting from examinations performed by regulatory authorities. Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements provides an overview of the process management uses for determining the ACL, and additional discussion of the ACL is provided in a separate section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. The ACL may increase or decrease due to changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables, including new information regarding existing problem loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the fair value of underlying 

 37 

Table of Contents CITIZENS NORTHERN CORPORATION FORM 10-Q 
 collateral, unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics, and other factors. Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans, and therefore the appropriateness of the ACL, could change significantly. Fair Value of Available-For-Sale Debt Securities Another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the Corporation s debt securities. For most of the Corporation s debt securities, the Corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service, or from brokers. In developing fair values, the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows, based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments. Based on experience, management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services. NET INTEREST INCOME The Corporation s primary source of operating income is net interest income, which is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense. Tables IV, V and VI include information regarding the Corporation s net interest income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In each of these tables, the amounts of interest income earned on tax-exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management believes presentation of net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with meaningful information for purposes of comparing returns on tax-exempt securities and loans with returns on taxable securities and loans. Accordingly, the amount of net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis reflected in these tables exceed the net interest income amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements. The discussion that follows is based on amounts in the related tables. Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 For the three-month periods, fully taxable equivalent net interest income (a non-GAAP measure) of 20,361,000 in 2024 was 486,000 (2.4 higher than in 2023 as average earning assets were 106,852,000 higher in the third quarter 2024 as compared to the third quarter 2023. Average total deposits increased 94,562,000 in the third quarter 2024 over the third quarter 2023. As presented in Table VI, the net impact of changes in volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities increased net interest income in the third quarter 2024 as compared to third quarter 2023 by 613,000, while the net impact of changes in interest rates (primarily increases) decreased net interest income by 127,000. As presented in Table V, the Net Interest Margin was 3.29 in the third quarter 2024 as compared to 3.35 in the third quarter 2023, and the Interest Rate Spread (excess of average rate of return on earning assets over average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities) decreased to 2.55 in 2024 from 2.73 in 2023. The average yield on earning assets of 5.38 was 0.44 higher in 2024 as compared to 2023, and the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 2.83 in 2024 was 0.62 higher. INTEREST INCOME AND EARNING ASSETS Interest income totaled 33,292,000 in 2024, an increase of 3,962,000, or 13.5 from 2023. Interest and fees from loans receivable increased 2,639,000 in 2024 as compared to 2023. The fully taxable equivalent yield on loans in 2024 increased to 6.08 from 5.72 in 2023, reflecting the effects of rising interest rates on the loan portfolio. Average outstanding loans receivable increased 71,472,000 (3.9 to 1,888,470,000 in 2024 from 1,816,998,000 in 2023. The increase in average loans receivable includes the impact of growth in commercial real estate and other commercial loans. Income from interest-bearing due from banks totaled 1,622,000 in 2024, an increase of 1,277,000 from the total for 2023. Within this category, the largest asset balance in 2024 and 2023 has been interest-bearing deposits held with the Federal Reserve. The average yield on interest-bearing due from banks was 5.38 in 2024, up from 4.31 in 2023. The average balance of interest-bearing due from banks was 119,885,000 in 2024, up 88,156,000 from 31,729,000 in 2023. The increase in interest-bearing due from banks included the net impact of the increase in average total deposits of 94,562,000, a reduction in average available-for-sale debt securities (amortized cost) of 54,384,000 and an increase in average borrowed funds of 27,739,000, partially offset by the increase in the average loans receivable of 71,472,000 and the net use of cash that contributed to an increase in average Bank-Owned Life Insurance of 18,911,000.

At September 30, 2024, total brokered deposits were 45,051,000. The deposit mix has changed as businesses and consumers have become more interest-rate sensitive in light of higher market rates. In comparing the third quarter 2024 to the third quarter 2023, average time deposits increased 79,272,000, average interest checking deposits increased 31,214,000 and average total money market accounts increased 15,689,000 while average savings deposits decreased 33,928,000.

Over the last several months of 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation entered into FHLB advances maturing mainly in 2025 to 2029, effectively using the proceeds to reduce higher rate short-term borrowings and increase cash held with the Federal Reserve. Borrowings are classified as long-term within the Tables based on their term at origination or assumption in business combinations. The average rate on long-term borrowings was 4.36 in 2024 compared to 3.87 in 2023. Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 For the nine-month periods, fully taxable equivalent net interest income (a non-GAAP measure) was 59,244,000 in 2024, which was 2,282,000 (3.7 lower than in 2023. The decrease in net interest income reflected an increase in interest expense of 13,645,000 and an increase in interest income of 11,363,000. As presented in Table VI, the net impact of changes in volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities increased net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the nine months ended September 30, 2023 by 1,849,000, while the net impact of changes in interest rates (primarily increases) decreased net interest income by 4,131,000. As presented in Table V, the Net Interest Margin was 3.30 in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 3.53 in the first nine months of 2023, and the Interest Rate Spread (excess of average rate of return on earning assets over average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities) decreased to 2.60 in 2024 from 2.99 in 2023.

 (1) Changes in income on tax-exempt securities and loans are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, using the Corporation s marginal federal income tax rate of 21 . (2) The change in interest due to both volume and rates has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each. 
 INCOME TAXES The income tax provision in interim periods is based on the Corporation s estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. The income tax provision for the third quarter 2024 of 1,448,000 was 398,000 lower than the provision for the third quarter 2023 and the provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 3,966,000 was 708,000 lower than the amount for the first nine months of 2023 due to lower pre-tax income in 2024. The effective tax rate (tax provision as a percentage of pre-tax income) was 18.5 in the third quarter 2024 compared to 19.6 in the third quarter 2023 and 18.2 for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 19.0 for the first nine months of 2023. The Corporation s effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of 21 principally because of the effects of tax-exempt interest income, nondeductible interest expense, state income taxes and other permanent differences.

 The Corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 represents the following temporary difference components: 

September 30, December 31, (In Thousands) 2024 2023 Deferred tax assets: Unrealized holding losses on securities 8,574 10,335 Allowance for credit losses on loans 4,490 4,230 Purchase accounting adjustments on loans 367 470 Deferred compensation 1,426 1,352 Operating leases liability 725 787 Deferred loan origination fees 716 731 Net operating loss carryforward 453 541 Accrued incentive compensation 494 463 Other deferred tax assets 1,442 1,316 Total deferred tax assets 18,687 20,225 Deferred tax liabilities: BOLI surrender 0 950 Defined benefit plans - ASC 835 90 119 Bank premises and equipment 270 291 Core deposit intangibles 478 544 Right-of-use assets from operating leases 725 787 Other deferred tax liabilities 77 93 Total deferred tax liabilities 1,640 2,784 Deferred tax asset, net 17,047 17,441 The Corporation regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based on history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income. Management believes the recorded net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2024 is fully realizable; however, if management determines the Corporation will be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset, the Corporation would adjust the deferred tax asset, which would negatively impact earnings . SECURITIES Management continually evaluates several objectives in determining the size, securities mix and other characteristics of the available-for-sale debt securities (investment) portfolio. Key objectives include supporting liquidity needs and maximizing return on earning assets within reasonable risk parameters.

The volatility in the fair value of the portfolio, including the reduction in fair value, resulted from changes in interest rates. As shown above, the market yield on the 5-year U.S. Treasury Note was 0.26 lower at September 30, 2024 in comparison to December 31, 2023, 0.41 lower than at December 31, 2022 and 2.32 higher than at December 31, 2021. The table also shows that the amortized cost basis of the portfolio has been reduced to 447,392,000 at September 30, 2024 from 561,794,000 at December 31, 2022 as proceeds from maturities and sales have been used to help fund loan growth and for other purposes. Additional information regarding the potential impact of interest rate changes on all of the Corporation s financial instruments is provided in Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. As described in Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, management determined the Corporation does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell, available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 before it is able to recover the amortized cost basis. Further, management reviewed the Corporation s holdings as of September 30, 2024 and concluded there were no credit-related declines in fair value. Additional information related to the types

 of securities held at September 30, 2024, other than securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government entities or agencies, is as follows: Bank holding company debt securities All of the Corporation s holdings of bank holding company debt securities were investment grade and there have been no payment defaults. There were seven securities with face amounts ranging from 3 million to 5 million, including one senior security and six subordinated securities. All of the issuers have publicly traded common stock . At September 30, 2024, the securities have external ratings ranging from BBB-/Baa3 to A-. Obligations of states and political subdivisions (municipal bonds) All of the Corporation s holdings of municipal bonds were investment grade and there have been no payment defaults. Summary ratings information at September 30, 2024, based on the amortized cost basis and reflecting the lowest enhanced or underlying rating by Moody s, Standard Poors or Fitch, is as follows: AAA or pre-refunded 22 of the portfolio; AA 71 ; A 7 . Private label commercial mortgage-backed securities (PLCMBS) There were two PLCMBS securities, both of which were from the most senior payment (subordination) classes of their respective issuances. These securities were investment grade (rated Aaa), and there have been no payment defaults on these securities. 
 Based on the results of management s assessment, there was no ACL required on available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024. FINANCIAL CONDITION This section includes information regarding the Corporation s lending activities or other significant changes or exposures that are not otherwise addressed in Management s Discussion and Analysis. Significant changes in the average balances of the Corporation s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are described in the Net Interest Income section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. Other significant balance sheet items, including securities, the allowance for credit losses and stockholders equity, are discussed in separate sections of Management s Discussion and Analysis. Management does not expect the amount of purchases of bank premises and equipment to have a material effect on the Corporation s financial condition in 2024. Table VII shows the composition of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and at year-end from 2019 through 2023. The significant loan growth in 2020 reflects the impact of an acquisition of a bank located in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Primarily as a result of the expansion into Southeastern Pennsylvania, as well as expansion by opening two offices in Southcentral Pennsylvania, the mix of the loan portfolio has become predominantly commercial in nature. At September 30, 2024, commercial loans represented 75 of the portfolio while residential loans totaled 22 of the portfolio. Also included in Table VII is additional detail regarding the composition of the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. The data in Table VII shows the recorded investment in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans for which the primary purpose is utilization of office space by third parties was 96,241,000, or 5.1 of gross loans receivable. At September 30, 2024, within this segment there were two loans with a total recorded investment of 3,204,000 in nonaccrual status with a specific allowance of 14,000 on one loan. During the third quarter 2024, there was a partial charge-off of 640,000 on the other office loan in nonaccrual status which had a specific allowance of 455,000 at June 30, 2024. The charge-off resulted from a decrease in the appraised value of property which is the primary source of collateral. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of this loan was 1,846,000. At September 30, 2024, there was no specific allowance on this loan though it remained in nonaccrual status. The remainder of the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans with a primary purpose of office space utilization were in accrual status with no specific allowance at September 30, 2024. The Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses section of Management s Discussion and Analysis provides additional related discussion. While the Corporation s lending activities are primarily concentrated in its market areas, a portion of the Corporation s commercial loan segment consists of participation loans. Participation loans represent portions of larger commercial transactions for which other institutions are the lead banks . Although not the lead bank, the Corporation conducts detailed underwriting and monitoring of participation loan opportunities. Total participation loans outstanding amounted to 35,652,000 at September 30, 2024 down from 38,652,000 at December 31, 2023.

 The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance risk, including commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, the total contract amount of commitments to extend credit was 378,535,000 as compared to 395,997,000 at December 31, 2023, and the contract amount of standby letters of credit increased to 64,938,000 at September 30, 2024 from 19,158,000 at December 31, 2023. The increase in standby letters of credit at September 30, 2024 included a 40,000,000 letter of credit with a one-year term, subject to annual review for possible renewal, that was issued to guarantee performance on behalf of a municipal customer. This letter of credit is collateralized by the municipal customer s investments in certificates of deposit and marketable securities. The Corporation maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit, commitments to extend future credit, commercial letters of credit and credit enhancement obligations related to residential mortgage loans sold with recourse, when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable (i.e. commitment cannot be canceled at any time). The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated lives. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet exposures of 593,000 at September 30, 2024 and 690,000 at December 31, 2023, is included in accrued interest and other liabilities on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation originates and sells residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Xtra program administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Chicago. Residential mortgages originated and sold through the MPF Xtra program consist primarily of conforming, prime loans sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), a quasi-government entity. The Corporation also originates and sells residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Original program, administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Chicago. Residential mortgages originated and sold through the MPF Original program consist primarily of conforming, prime loans sold to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. For loan sales originated under the MPF programs, the Corporation provides customary representations and warranties to investors that specify, among other things, that the loans have been underwritten to the standards established by the investor. The Corporation may be required to repurchase a loan and reimburse a portion of fees received or reimburse the investor for a credit loss incurred on a loan, if it is determined that the representations and warranties have not been met. Such repurchases or reimbursements generally result from an underwriting or documentation deficiency. At September 30, 2024, the total outstanding balance of loans the Corporation has repurchased as a result of identified instances of noncompliance amounted to 2,698,000, and the corresponding total outstanding balance of repurchased loans at December 31, 2023 was 2,839,000. At September 30, 2024, outstanding balances of loans sold and serviced through the MPF Xtra and Original programs totaled 325,004,000, including loans sold through the MPF Xtra program of 152,880,000 and loans sold through the Original program of 172,124,000. At December 31, 2023, outstanding balances of loans sold and serviced through the two programs totaled 323,298,000, including loans sold through the MPF Xtra program of 150,015,000 and loans sold through the Original Program of 173,283,000. Based on the fairly limited volume of required repurchases to date, no allowance has been established for representation and warranty exposures as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES A summary of the provision (credit) for credit losses for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 

(In Thousands) 3 Months 3 Months 9 Months 9 Months Ended Ended Ended Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Provision (credit) for credit losses: Loans receivable 1,297 (933) 2,823 (409) Off-balance sheet exposures (90) (292) (97) (356) Total provision (credit) for credit losses 1,207 (1,225) 2,726 (765) For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was a provision for credit losses of 1,207,000, an increase of 2,432,000 compared to a credit for credit losses (reduction in expense) of 1,225,000 in third quarter 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a provision for credit losses of 2,726,000, an increase of 3,491,000 compared to a credit for credit losses of 765,000 in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision related to loans receivable included the impact of increases in the ACL from an increase in qualitative adjustments resulting mainly from changes in external indexes and an increase in past due and nonaccrual loans as well as net charge-offs in excess of specific allowances . The ACL as a percentage of gross loans receivable increased to 1.08 at September 30, 2024 from 1.04 at December 31, 2023; in comparison, the ACL dropped to 0.99 of gross loans receivable at September 30, 2023 from 1.08 upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2023. As shown in Table IX, the ACL on loans individually evaluated decreased to 173,000 at September 30, 2024 from 743,000 at December 31, 2023, primarily from partial charge-offs on two loans with individual ACLs at December 31, 2023. In the third quarter 2024, there was a partial charge-off of 640,000 on a non-owner occupied commercial real estate office loan with a specific allowance of 455,000 at June 30, 2024 and 486,000 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of this loan was 1,846,000 with no specific allowance on the loan. In the second quarter 2024, there was a partial charge-off of 117,000 on a non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan for which there was an ACL of 124,000 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, there was no ACL on the loan and the carrying value of the loan was 3,276,000 . At September 30, 2024, there were two commercial relationships with loans receivable totaling 1,622,000 for which individual ACLs were recorded, including one non-owner occupied office loan with an outstanding balance of 1,357,000 and an individual ACL of 14,000. Table IX also shows that, at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, the ACL related to collectively evaluated commercial loans increased by a total of 1,741,000 and the ACL on collectively evaluated consumer loans increased 67,000, while the ACL on collectively evaluated residential mortgage loans decreased 4,000. The increase for commercial loans includes the impact of an increase in qualitative adjustments resulting mainly from changes in external indexes and an increase in past due and nonaccrual loans. In the first nine months of 2024, net charge-offs totaled 1,589,000, or 0.08 (0.11 annualized) of average outstanding loans. In addition to the two charge-offs described above, in the third quarter 2024 there was a partial charge-off of 427,000 on two commercial construction and land loans to one borrower with a specific ACL of 447,000 at June 30, 2024 and no specific ACL at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of these loans totaled 1,883,000 with no specific allowance on the loans. Table VIII shows annual average net charge-off rates ranging from a high of 0.26 in 2022 to a low of 0.01 in 2023. Table X shows that total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.92 at September 30, 2024, up from 0.75 at December 31, 2023 but lower than at year-end 2020 through 2022. Total nonperforming assets were 24,638,000 at September 30, 2024, up from 18,845,000 at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans included an increase in nonaccrual loans of 9,244,000 from December 31, 2023, while loans past due 90 days or more still accruing decreased 3,134,000 from December 31, 2023. In the first nine 

 49 

Table of Contents CITIZENS NORTHERN CORPORATION FORM 10-Q 
 months of 2024, the net increase in nonaccrual loans included an increase in nonaccrual commercial construction and land loans, primarily to three borrowers. Table X also shows that loans past due 30-89 days totaled 15,906,000 at September 30, 2024, up from 9,275,000 at December 31, 2023. The net increase includes a multi-family residential loan with a carrying value of 7,650,000 that was 60 days past due at September 30, 2024. The property that collateralizes this loan is a newly-built apartment complex for which construction was completed to the point of allowing tenants to begin occupying the units in the summer of 2024. Based on management s assessment of appraisal and market information, and support provided by a guarantor, there was no individual ACL on this loan at September 30, 2024. Over the period 2019-2023 and the first nine months of 2024, each period includes a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts. As a result, a limited number of relationships may significantly impact the total amount of allowance required on individual loans and may significantly impact the provision for credit losses and the amount of total charge-offs reported in any one period. Management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of loans requiring individual evaluation for credit loss, estimates of loss, and nonaccrual status; however, the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of September 30, 2024. Management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for credit losses and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status, if appropriate. Tables VIII through X present historical data related to loans and the allowance for credit losses.

 LIQUIDITY Liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost. An adequate liquidity position permits the Corporation to pay creditors, compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand. The Corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day-to-day liquidity. Also, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, secured by various mortgage loans. The Corporation has a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia s Discount Window. Management intends to use this line of credit as a contingency funding source. As collateral for the line, the Corporation has pledged available-for-sale debt securities with a carrying value of 19,387,000 at September 30, 2024. The Corporation s outstanding, available, and total credit facilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows: 

Outstanding Available Total Credit (In Thousands) September 30, December 31, September 30, December 31, September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh 207,858 189,021 737,284 737,824 945,142 926,845 Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window 0 0 18,602 19,982 18,602 19,982 Other correspondent banks 0 0 75,000 75,000 75,000 75,000 Total credit facilities 207,858 189,021 830,886 832,806 1,038,744 1,021,827 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation s outstanding credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh consisted of short-term advances of 10,000,000, long-term borrowings of 174,617,000 and letters of credit totaling 23,241,000. At December 31, 2023, the Corporation s outstanding credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh consisted of overnight and short-term borrowings of 31,500,000, long-term borrowings of 138,313,000 and letters of credit totaling 19,208,000. Additional information regarding borrowed funds is included in Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the Corporation uses RepoSweep arrangements to borrow funds from commercial banking customers on an overnight basis. If required to raise cash in an emergency situation, the Corporation could sell available-for-sale securities to meet its obligations or use repurchase agreements placed with brokers to borrow funds secured by investment assets. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of available-for-sale securities in excess of amounts required to meet pledging or repurchase agreement obligations was 223,060,000. Deposits totaled 2,135,879,000 at September 30, 2024, up 121,073,000 (6.0 from 2,014,806,000 at December 31, 2023. Excluding brokered deposits, adjusted total deposits at September 30, 2024 were higher by 140,391,000 (7.2 as compared to December 31, 2023. Brokered deposits totaled 45,051,000 at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 19,318,000 from December 31, 2023. The increase in total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, included an increase in total deposits from municipal relationships of 64,829,000 to 342,541,000 at September 30, 2024 from 277,712,000 at December 31, 2023, consistent with historic seasonal trends for the Corporation s Pennsylvania-based municipal depositors. As shown in the table below, at September 30, 2024, estimated uninsured deposits totaled 655.6 million, or 30.5 of total deposits, as compared to 592.2 million or 29.2 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Included in uninsured deposits are deposits collateralized by securities (almost exclusively municipal deposits) totaling 183.3 million at September 30, 2024. As shown in the table below, total uninsured and uncollateralized deposits amounted to 21.9 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, as compared to 21.7 at December 31, 2023. As summarized in the table that immediately follows, the Corporation s highly liquid sources of available funds described above, including unused borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, unused availability on the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia s discount window, available federal funds lines with other banks and unencumbered available-for-sale debt securities totaled 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024. Available funding from these sources totaled 160.8 of uninsured deposits and 223.2 of total uninsured and uncollateralized deposits at September 30, 2024.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY In August 2018, the Federal Reserve Board issued an interim final rule that expanded applicability of the Board s small bank holding company policy statement. The interim final rule raised the policy statement s asset threshold from 1 billion to 3 billion in total consolidated assets for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that: (1) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities; (2) does not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities; and (3) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities, other than trust-preferred securities, outstanding. The interim final rule provides that, if warranted for supervisory purposes, the Federal Reserve may exclude a company from the threshold increase. Management believes the Corporation meets the conditions of the Federal Reserve s small bank holding company policy statement and is therefore excluded from consolidated capital requirements at September 30, 2024; however, C N Bank remains subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.

 Details concerning capital ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented below. Management believes, as of September 30, 2024, that C N Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and maintains a capital conservation buffer (described in more detail below) that allows C N Bank to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. For comparison purposes, the Corporation s capital ratios are presented along with those of C N Bank in the table below. Further, as reflected in the table below, the Corporation s and C N Bank s capital ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 exceed the Corporation s Board policy threshold levels.

The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. At September 30, 2024, the minimum risk-based capital ratios, and the capital ratios including the capital conservation buffer, are as follows: 

Minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio 4.5 Minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer 7.0 Minimum tier 1 capital ratio 6.0 Minimum tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer 8.5 Minimum total capital ratio 8.0 Minimum total capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer 10.5 A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5 over the minimum risk-based capital ratios would not be subject to additional limits on dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer less than 2.5 would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. Also, a banking organization is prohibited from making dividend payments or discretionary bonus payments if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 as of the beginning of that quarter. Eligible net income is defined as net income for the four calendar

 quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. A summary of payout restrictions based on the capital conservation buffer is as follows: 

Capital Conservation Buffer Maximum Payout (as a of risk-weighted assets) (as a of eligible retained income) Greater than 2.5 No payout limitation applies 2.5 and >1.875 60 1.875 and >1.25 40 1.25 and >0.625 20 0.625 0 At September 30, 2024 , C N Bank s Capital Conservation Buffer, determined based on the minimum total capital ratio, was 6.96 . On September 25, 2023, the Corporation announced a new treasury stock repurchase program. Under the program, the Corporation is authorized to repurchase up to 750,000 shares of the Corporation s common stock, or slightly less than 5 of the Corporation s issued and outstanding shares at August 4, 2023. The new program was effective when publicly announced and will continue thereafter until suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion. All shares of common stock repurchased pursuant to the new program shall be held as treasury shares and be available for use and reissuance for purposes as and when determined by the Board of Directors including, without limitation, pursuant to the Corporation s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plans and its equity compensation program. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 26,034 shares were repurchased for a total cost of 443,000, at an average price of 17.02 per share. At September 30, 2024, there were 723,966 shares available to be repurchased under the program. Future dividend payments and repurchases of common stock will depend upon maintenance of a strong financial condition, future earnings and capital and regulatory requirements. In addition, the Corporation and C N Bank are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be paid without approval of banking regulatory authorities. Further, although the Corporation is no longer subject to the specific consolidated capital requirements described herein, the Corporation s ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in other activities may be limited by the Federal Reserve if the Corporation fails to hold capital commensurate with its overall risk profile. The Corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available-for-sale debt securities. The difference between amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax, is included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within stockholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income is excluded from the Bank s and Corporation s regulatory capital ratios. The balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax, amounted to 30,396,000 at September 30, 2024 and 38,878,000 at December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders equity in the first nine months of 2024 from the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss resulted from a decrease in interest rates. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity. To the extent unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities result from credit losses, unrealized losses are recorded as a charge against earnings. The securities section of Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements provide additional information concerning management s evaluation of available-for-sale debt securities for credit losses at September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices of the Corporation s financial instruments. In addition to the effects of interest rates, the market prices of the Corporation s available-for-sale debt securities are affected by fluctuations in the risk premiums (amounts of spread over risk-free rates) demanded by investors. Management attempts to limit the risk that economic conditions would force the Corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position (discussed in the Stockholders Equity and Capital Adequacy section of Management s Discussion and Analysis) and ample sources of liquidity (discussed in the Liquidity section of Management s Discussion and Analysis). The Corporation s major category of market risk, interest rate risk, is discussed in the following section. INTEREST RATE RISK The Corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the economic value of equity EVE ). For purposes of these calculations, EVE includes the discounted present values of financial instruments, such as securities, loans, deposits and borrowed funds, and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses. The model measures and projects the amount of potential changes in net interest income and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments, assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. Management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus 100-400 basis points of current rates. The projected results based on the model includes the impact of estimates, at each level of interest rate change, regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities and call activity on other investment securities. Further, the projected results are impacted by assumptions regarding the run-off and the extent of sensitivity to interest rate changes of deposits with no stated maturity (checking, savings and money market accounts). Actual results could vary significantly from these estimates, which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest income and EVE. Also, the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition, and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. The Corporation s Board of Directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk, based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. The policy limits acceptable fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline (flat rates) one-year scenario and variances in EVE from the baseline values based on current rates. Table XI, which follows this discussion, is based on the results of calculations performed using the simulation model as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Table shows that as of the respective dates, the changes in net interest income and changes in economic value of equity were within the policy limits in all scenarios. Based on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 data, the amounts of net interest income decrease, as compared to the amounts based on current interest rates, in both the upward and downward rate scenarios. The modeling results reflect the impact of management s assumptions that the Corporation s deposit rates would rise in the increasing rate scenarios to a greater extent than they would fall in the decreasing rate scenarios. Further, results in the downward rate scenarios reflect limitations on the benefit of falling rates on some deposit types due to a 0 assumed floor. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, EVE is modeled to decrease compared to the 0 basis point scenario in all of the rising and falling rate scenarios except for a slight (0.6 increase at September 30, 2024 in the up 100 basis points scenario. In Table XI, EVE is higher at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 in the 0 basis point, down 100 and 200 basis points and all of the rising rate scenarios, but lower in the down 300 and 400 basis point scenarios. The volatility in comparative amounts of EVE reflects the impact of an overall increase in the assumed lives of nonmaturity deposits used in the September 30, 2024 analysis based on an updated study completed in the second quarter 2024. Volatility in EVE values also reflect lower discount rates used in the model at September 30, 2024 than at December 31, 2023, consistent with lower market rates.

 Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value as of each balance sheet date. The difference between amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax, is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Increases in interest rates have caused the fair value of the Corporation s available-for-sale debt securities to decrease, resulting in an accumulated other comprehensive loss related to securities of 30.4 million at September 30, 2024. In contrast, most of the Corporation s other financial instruments, including loans receivable (held for investment), deposits and borrowed funds are carried on the balance sheet at historical cost without adjustment for the impact of changes in interest rates.
