Introduction 

The VanEck Merk Gold ETF (the Trust ),
formerly known as the Merk Gold Trust prior to October 26, 2015 and then as the Van Eck Merk Gold Trust prior to April 28, 2016, and then
as VanEck Merk Gold Trust prior to August 30, 2024, is an exchange-traded fund formed on May 6, 2014 under New York law pursuant to a
depositary trust agreement (as amended, the Trust Agreement ). The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment
vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
and is not required to register under such act. It will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool,
or subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing shares. 

The Trust s primary objective is to provide
investors with an opportunity to invest in gold through the shares and be able to take delivery of physical gold bullion and gold coins physical gold in exchange for those shares. The Trust s secondary objective is for the shares to reflect the performance
of the price of gold less the expenses of the Trust s operations. Each share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest
in the Trust s net assets. The Trust s assets consist principally of gold held on the Trust s behalf in financial institutions
for safekeeping. Physical gold that the Trust will hold includes London Bars and, for the limited purposes described herein, other gold
bars and coins, without numismatic value, having a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5 or, for American Gold Eagle
gold coins, with a minimum fineness of 91.67 . 

Shares are issued by the Trust only in blocks
of 50,000 shares called Baskets in exchange for gold from certain registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants Authorized Participants ). See Creation and Redemption of Shares Authorized Participants in the
notes to our financial statements for requirements to qualify as an Authorized Participant. Baskets may be redeemed by the Trust in exchange
for the amount of gold corresponding to their redemption value. The Trust issues and redeems Baskets on an ongoing basis at net asset
value to Authorized Participants who have entered into a contract with the Sponsor and the Trustee. 

Shares of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE Arca under the symbol OUNZ . 

Valuation of Gold and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On each business day that the NYSE Arca is open
for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 PM (New York time) the Trustee will value the gold held by the Trust and will
determine the net asset value NAV of the Trust, as described below. 

The NAV of the Trust is the aggregate value of
gold and other assets, if any, of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust s reserve account, if any) and cash, if
any, less liabilities of the Trust, which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities. 

All gold is valued based on its Fine Ounce content,
calculated by multiplying the weight of gold by its purity; the same methodology is applied independent of the type of gold held by the
Trust; similarly, the value of up to 430 Fine Ounces of unallocated gold the Trust may hold is calculated by multiplying the number of
Fine Ounces with the price of gold determined by the Trustee as follows. 

12 

Prior to August 7, 2023 (the Index Change
Date ), the Trustee valued the gold held by the Trust based on the afternoon session of the twice daily fix of the price of a Fine
Ounce of gold which starts at 3:00 PM London, England time and is performed in London by the ICE Benchmark Administration as an independent
third-party administrator (the LBMA PM Gold Price ). The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share. Prior to the Index Change
Date, if on a day when the Trust s NAV was being calculated the LBMA PM Gold Price for that day was not available, the Trustee would
value the gold held by the Trust based on that day s morning session of the twice daily fix of the price of a Fine Ounce of gold,
which starts at 10:30 AM London, England time and is performed in London by the ICE Benchmark Administration as an independent third-party
administrator (the LBMA AM Gold Price and together with the LBMA PM Gold Price, the LBMA Gold Price ). If no
fix was available for the day, the Trustee valued the Trust s gold based on the most recently announced LBMA AM Gold Price or LBMA
PM Gold Price. 

On the Index Change Date, the pricing index the
Sponsor uses in relation to the Shares issued by the Trust changed to the Solactive Gold Spot Index (the Solactive Index in lieu of the LBMA Gold Price. 

Since the Index Change Date, the Trustee values
the gold held by the Trust based on the Solactive Index. Solactive AG Solactive owns, calculates, and disseminates the
Solactive Index. The Solactive Index is a U.S. Dollar denominated index that aims to provide a price fixing for the gold spot price quoted
as U.S. Dollars per Troy Ounce XAU and determined for the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ).
The Solactive Index calculates gold bullion fixing prices by taking Time Weighted Average Prices TWAP of XAU trading prices
provided via ICE Data Services IDS data feed. 

Specifically, the Solactive Index uses a TWAP
calculation to determine an average price that is time-weighted, using price values of actual transactions Trade Ticks for two specified time periods around the scheduled close of trading on the NYSE (generally, 4:00 PM Eastern Time). The TWAP is derived
for (1) the period ahead of the fixing Time Period 1 ), which consists of the five minutes before the close of trading,
and (2) the period directly after the fixing Time Period 2 ), which consists of the six seconds after the close of trading.
The TWAPs for Time Period 1 and Time Period 2 are then aggregated, with 90 weighting given to Time Period 1 and 10 weighting given to
Time Period 2, to calculate the Solactive Index. The TWAPs for Time Period 1 and Time Period 2 are then added together to establish the
Solactive Index price. 

For any calculation day t, the Solactive Index
(Indext), is determined in accordance with the following formula: 

The Solactive Index is calculated and published
by Solactive no later than 30 minutes following the close of trading on the NYSE, disseminated to major financial data providers, and
made publicly available via the Trust s website. 

The Solactive Index calculation is based on XAU
market data from IDS, which is a major provider of financial market data. The data is available through IDS s data streaming service,
which covers 2,700 spot rates and over 7,500 forwards and non-deliverable forwards, with an average of over 130 million updates per day
for spot. IDS compiles data from over 100 sources, including market makers, execution venues, banks and brokers from across the globe,
and every updating Trade Tick of spot streaming data is available via IDS s Integrated Data Viewer service in a file-based format. 

It is unlikely that, on any given trading day
for the Shares, there would be no Trade Ticks recorded for XAU in either Time Period 1 or Time Period 2, such that the Solactive Index
calculation could not be performed on such day. Trade Ticks representing XAU are the closing prices for specific gold bullion transactions
posted in a 24-hour, global, over-the-counter gold bullion market, which is not subject to trading suspensions, trading halts, or market
closures. However, in the unlikely event that IDS is unable to publish pricing information for XAU, for whatever reason, during either
Time Period 1 or Time Period 2 on a given trading day, the last available Solactive Index calculation will be used in accordance with
Solactive s published and publicly available disruption policy. 

13 

If the Sponsor determines that such price becomes
inappropriate to use, it shall identify an alternate basis for evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. The Sponsor may instruct the
Trustee to use a different publicly available price which the Sponsor determines to fairly represent the commercial value of the Trust s
gold. 

Material Events 

On October 22, 2015, the Sponsor and the Trustee
entered into a First Amendment To Depositary Trust Agreement (the First Trust Amendment ), amending the Trust Agreement,
dated as of May 6, 2014, to effectuate a change in the name of the Trust from Merk Gold Trust to Van Eck Merk Gold
Trust, effective as of October 26, 2015. As a result of the name change, all references to Merk Gold Trust in the
Trust Agreement were amended to read Van Eck Merk Gold Trust, and the shares offered by the Trust were known as the Van
Eck Merk Gold Shares Shares ). 

On October 22, 2015, the Sponsor, for the benefit
of the Trust, entered into a Marketing Agent Agreement (as amended to date, the Marketing Agreement with Van Eck Securities
Corporation VanEck or Marketing Agent ). Pursuant to the Marketing Agreement, VanEck now provides assistance
in the marketing of the Shares. The obligations created by the Marketing Agreement are obligations of the Sponsor of the Trust and any
fees payable under the Marketing Agreement to VanEck are payable from the Sponsor s fee (as calculated and defined in the Trust
Agreement). The Trust will not incur additional financial or other performance obligations pursuant to the Marketing Agreement. 

The Sponsor entered into the First Trust Amendment
and effectuated the name change of the Trust in satisfaction of a term of the Marketing Agreement. The Marketing Agreement further grants
VanEck the right to elect to replace Merk as the sponsor of the Trust under specific qualifying circumstances, subject to the execution
and consummation of definitive agreements addressing all regulatory requirements applicable to such transaction and satisfaction of such
requirements, and announcement and related reporting at such time. Specifically, VanEck has a right of first refusal for the purchase
of the sponsorship of the Trust, and all rights attributable thereto, upon the earlier of a commitment for a change of control of Merk
or 15 years from the date of the Marketing Agreement. Additionally, VanEck may elect to replace Merk as the sponsor of the Trust upon
the earlier of the average daily net assets of the Trust during a calendar quarter not attributable to Shares held by Merk or its affiliates Third Party Assets equaling 500 million, or VanEck s compensation under the fee provisions of the Marketing Agreement
reaching in aggregate 10 of the gross proceeds from sale of the Shares (the Maximum Fee ). 

Merk further agreed that if the Third Party Assets
equal or exceed 500 million, for such period as Merk remains sponsor of the Trust, VanEck may propose the rate of the Sponsor s
fee to Merk, which Merk shall not unreasonably reject and shall timely adopt if reasonable, provided, VanEck acknowledges that only the
formal named sponsor of the Trust shall have the right to set the Sponsor s fee at any time. 

On April 28, 2016, the Sponsor and the Trustee
entered into a Second Amendment to Depositary Trust Agreement (the Second Trust Amendment ), amending the Trust Agreement
to effectuate a second change in the name of the Trust from Van Eck Merk Gold Trust to VanEck Merk Gold Trust, 
at the request of the Marketing Agent to reflect its rebranding as VanEck . As a result of the name change, all references
to Van Eck Merk Gold Trust in the Trust Agreement were amended to read VanEck Merk Gold Trust, and the Shares
offered by the Trust are now known as the VanEck Merk Gold Shares . Except for the name change effected pursuant to the Second
Trust Amendment, the Trust Agreement remains in full force and effect on its existing terms. 

Effective July 24, 2020, the Sponsor exercised
its rights under the Trust Agreement to adjust the Sponsor s fee upon written notice to the Trustee and publication of the proposed
change on its website. The Sponsor s fee is payable at an annualized rate of 0.25 of the Trust s NAV, accrued on a daily
basis computed on the prior business day s NAV and paid monthly in arrears. 

As of the Index Change Date, the Sponsor has changed
the pricing index it uses in relation to the Shares issued by the Trust to reference the Solactive Index in lieu of the LBMA Gold Price.
In determining the Trust s NAV, the Trustee now values the gold held by the Trust based on the Solactive Index. 

On August 20, 2024, the Sponsor and the Trustee
entered into a Third Amendment to Depository Trust Agreement (the Third Trust Amendment ), effective as of August 30, 2024,
amending the Second Trust Agreement to effectuate a third change in the name of the Trust from VanEck Merk Gold Trust to
 VanEck Merk Gold ETF. As a result of the name change, all references to VanEck Merk Gold Trust in the Trust
Agreement were amended to read VanEck Merk Gold ETF. The Shares offered by the Trust remain known as the VanEck Merk
Gold Shares. Except for the name change effected pursuant to the Third Trust Amendment, the Trust Agreement remains in full force
and effect on its existing terms. 

14 

Change in Settlement Cycle and Amendment to
Authorized Participant Agreements 

Effective May 28, 2024, the creation and redemption
of new Baskets for the Trust typically will be settled on a T+1 basis (i.e., one business day after the trade date), unless
the Trust and Authorized Participant agree to a different settlement date. However, the Trust reserves the right to settle such transactions
on a basis other than T+1 effective May 28, 2024, including in order to accommodate the non-U.S. market holiday schedules, and closures
and settlement cycles. Further, an Authorized Participant and the Trust may agree in advance of order acceptance to a different settlement
cycle than the standard securities transaction settlement cycle of one business day if the allocation or de-allocation, as the case may
be, of Trust s bullion would be expected to be delayed and prevent a one business day settlement cycle for the order. 

Due to the fact that the aforementioned creation
and redemption procedures are addressed in the Authorized Participant Agreements by among the Authorized Participants, the Trustee and
the Sponsor, the Trustee and the Sponsor exercised their rights to amend each such agreement to address the new T+2 settlement cycle and
executed First Amendments to each of the Authorized Participant Agreements, effective as of September 5, 2017, and provided timely notice
of such amendment to the Authorized Participants. Except for the foregoing amendments, the Authorized Participant Agreements remain in
full force and effect on their existing terms. 

Results from Operations 

The Trust is a trust formed on May 6, 2014 under
New York law pursuant to the Trust Agreement. After consideration of Financial Accounting Standards Topic 946, however, the Sponsor has
concluded that for financial statement reporting purposes the Trust meets the fundamental characteristics of an investment company. In
addition, while the Trust does not currently possess all of the typical characteristics of an investment company, the Sponsor believes
the Trust s activities are consistent with those of an investment company and will therefore apply the guidance in Financial Accounting
Standards Topic 946, including disclosure of the financial support contractually required to be provided by an investment company to any
of its investees. The Sponsor is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the performance of the Trustee and the Trust s
principal service providers, including the preparation of financial statements. The Trustee is responsible for the day-to-day administration
of the Trust.

remain the obligations of the Sponsor of the Trust, any fees payable thereunder remain payable from the Sponsor s fee and the cap
on the fees payable to the Marketing Agent remains unchanged.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands,
commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for
the Sponsor s fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense
of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s fee. 

The Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor
or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s gold as necessary to pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor.
The Trustee will not sell gold to pay the Sponsor s fee but will pay the Sponsor s fee in Shares in lieu of cash. At October
31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, the Trust did not have any cash balances. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The unaudited financial statements and accompanying
notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
unaudited financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations.
These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the
unaudited financial statements for further discussion of accounting policies. 

Effective May 6, 2014, the Trust has adopted the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Topic 946, Investment Companies, and follows specialized accounting. 

Investment by Certain Retirement Plans 

Section 408(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended (the Code ), provides that the purchase of a collectible as an investment for an individual retirement
account (an IRA ), or for a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code section
401(a) Tax-Qualified Account ), is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the
participant for whom the Tax-Qualified Account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible.
The Trust, through the Sponsor, has received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that provides that (1) the acquisition
of Shares by an IRA or a Tax-Qualified Account will not constitute the acquisition of a collectible and (2) an IRA or such an account s
owning Shares will not be treated as having made a distribution to the IRA owner or plan participant under Code section 408(m) solely
by virtue of owning those Shares. If a redemption of Shares results in the delivery of gold to an IRA or Tax-Qualified Account, however,
that exchange would constitute the acquisition of a collectible to the extent provided under that section. See also ERISA and Related
Considerations. 

Investors who are considering exchanging their
Shares for gold coins or gold bullion should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax implications thereof before doing so. 

17 

ERISA and Related Considerations 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ERISA ), and section 4975 of the Code impose certain requirements on employee benefit plans and certain
other plans and arrangements, including IRAs and individual retirement annuities, Keogh plans and certain collective investment funds
or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans, accounts, annuities or arrangements are invested, that are subject
to ERISA or the Code, respectively (collectively, Plans ), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment
of assets treated as plan assets of a Plan. Investments by Plans are subject to the fiduciary requirements and the applicability
of prohibited transaction restrictions under ERISA. 

Government plans and some church plans are not
subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Code section 4975 but may be subject to substantially
similar rules under state or other federal law. Fiduciaries of any such plans are advised to consult with their counsel prior to an investment
in Shares. 

In contemplating an investment of a portion of
Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts
and circumstances of the Plan, the Risk Factors discussed below and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary
responsibilities, including (1) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing Plan instrument,
(2) whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect non-exempt prohibited transaction with a party in interest 
or disqualified person, (3) the Plan s funding objectives, and (4) whether under the general fiduciary standards of
investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the Plan s overall investment
policy, the composition of its investment portfolio and its need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Trust does not engage in transactions in foreign
currencies which could expose the Trust or holders of Shares to any foreign currency related market risk. The Trust does not invest in
any derivative financial instruments or long-term debt instruments. Fluctuations in the value of gold bullion will affect the value of
Shares which are designed to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Trust s expenses. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Sponsor, and to the auditor, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer of the Sponsor concluded that, as of October 31, 2024, the Trust s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. 

There have been no changes in the Trust s
or Sponsor s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust s fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s or Sponsor s internal control over
financial reporting.
