current assets by million. In addition, the Company had incurred net losses of million and had negative cash flows from operating
activities of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer and
Interim Chief Financial Officer has advanced an aggregate of as of September 30, 2024 to provide working capital and enabled
the Company to make the required payments related to its former construction loan facility. The Company anticipates operating losses to
continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, costs related to the production of its existing products, debt service
costs and selling and administrative costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. To alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, management plans to enhance the sales model of advance payment, and further
strengthen its collection of accounts receivable. Further, the Company is currently exploring strategic alternatives to accelerate the
launch of nutrition products. In addition, management believes that the Company s existing property, plant and equipment can serve
as collateral to support additional bank loans. While the current plans will allow the Company to fund its operations in the next twelve
months, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its future strategic alternatives raising substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern.

. 

There was no provision for income taxes for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively due to continued net losses of the Company. 

As of September 30, 2024, Helpson had net operating
loss carryforwards for PRC tax purposes of approximately million which are available to offset any future taxable income through
2029. Approximately million of these carryforwards will expire in December 2024. The Company also has net operating losses for United
States federal income tax purposes of approximately million of which million is available to offset future taxable income,
if any, . 

U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred
to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Reform ), was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Reform
significantly modified the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, reducing the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax
rate from to for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017; limiting and/or eliminating many business deductions; migrating
the U.S. to a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously deferred
foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries; subject to certain limitations, generally eliminating U.S. corporate income tax on dividends
from foreign subsidiaries; and providing for new taxes on certain foreign earnings. 

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
differences become deductible or tax loss carry forwards are utilized. Management considers projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon an assessment of the level of historical taxable income and
projections for future taxable income over the periods on which the deferred tax assets are deductible or can be utilized, management
believes it is not likely for the Company to realize all benefits of the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023. Therefore, the Company provided for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of and 
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The Company also incurred various other taxes,
comprised primarily of business taxes, value-added taxes, urban construction taxes, education surcharges and others. Any unpaid amounts
are reflected on the balance sheets as accrued taxes payable.

risks not typically associated with companies operating in the United States of America. These risks include, among others, the political,
economic and legal environments and fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate. The Company s results from operations may
be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect
to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among
other things. The unfavorable changes in global macroeconomic factors may also adversely affect the Company s operations. 

In addition, all of the Company s revenue
is denominated in the PRC s currency of Renminbi (RMB), which must be converted into other currencies before remittance out of the
PRC. Both the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of foreign currencies abroad require approval of the PRC government.

Business Overview Recent Developments 

China Pharma Holding Inc. China Pharma is not a Chinese operating company but a Nevada holding company. All of our operations are conducted in the PRC through Hainan Helpson
Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd Helpson ), our wholly owned subsidiary incorporated under the laws of the People s
Republic of China (the PRC ), where the manufacturing facilities are located. Helpson is principally engaged in the development,
manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products for human use in connection with a variety of high-incidence and high-mortality diseases
and medical conditions prevalent in the PRC. It manufactures pharmaceutical products in the form of dry powder injectables, liquid injectables,
tablets, capsules, and cephalosporin oral solutions. The majority of its pharmaceutical products are sold on a prescription basis and
all of them have been approved for at least one or more therapeutic indications by the National Medical Products Administration (the NMPA ,
formerly China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA) based upon demonstrated safety and efficacy. 

18 

China s consistency evaluation of generic
drugs continues to proceed in 2024. Helpson has always taken the task of promoting the consistency evaluation as a top priority, and worked
on them actively. However, for each drug s consistency evaluation, due to the continuous dynamic changes of the detailed consistency
evaluation policies, market trends, expected investments, and expected returns of investment ROI ), the whole industry,
including Helpson, has been making slow progresses in terms of the consistency evaluation. One of the flagship products, Candesartan tablets,
a hypertension product, has passed generic-drug-consistency-evaluation in early August 2023. 

Helpson has taken a more cautious and flexible
attitude towards initiating and progressing any project for existing products consistency evaluation to cope with the changing
macro environment of drug sales in China. In 2018, relevant Chinese authorities decided to implement trial Centralized Procurement CP activities in 11 selected pilot cities (including 4 municipalities and 7 other cities), since then, nine rounds of CP activities have
been carried out as of November 13, 2024, which significantly reduced the price of the drugs that won the bids. In addition, the consistency
evaluation has been adopted as one of the qualification standards for participating in the CP activities. As a result, Helpson needs to
balance between the market access brought by CP, the investment of financial resources and time to obtain the qualification of CP, and
the sharp decline in the price of drugs included in CP before making decisions regarding CP for any products. 

In addition, Helpson continues to explore the
field of comprehensive healthcare. Comprehensive healthcare is a general concept proposed by the Chinese government according to the development
of the times, social needs and changes in disease spectrum. According to the Outline of Healthy China 2030 issued by Chinese
government in October 2016, the total size of China s health service industry is expected to reach RMB 16 trillion (approximately
 2.5 trillion) by 2030. This industry focuses on people s daily life, aging and diseases, pays attention to all kinds of risk factors
and misunderstandings affecting health, calls for self-health management, and advocates the comprehensive care throughout the entire process
of life. It covers all kinds of health-related information, products, and services, as well as actions taken by various organizations
to meet the health needs. In response to this trend, Helpson launched Noni enzyme, a natural, Xeronine-rich antioxidant food supplement
at the end of 2018. It also launched wash-free sanitizers and masks, in 2020, to address the market needs caused by COVID-19 in China.
As Chinese government officially terminated its zero-case policy, now the responsibility to protect people from the impact of COVID-19
falls more to the citizens themselves, and masks and sanitizers have been popular since COVID-19. Helpson has sufficient production capacity
for medical masks, surgical masks, KN95 masks, and N95 masks, which also meets the personal needs for protection against other respiratory
infectious disease. Helpson s N95 medical protective mask has received registration certificate at the end of 2022 and has been
on the market in the mainland China nationwide. 

Helpson will continue to optimize its product
structure and actively respond to the current health needs of human beings.

Results of operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 

Revenue 

Revenue was 1.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.8 million in the same period 2023. This decline was mainly due to an increasing number of
drugs from other medicine providers being included in national CP, while Helpson s peer products have not passed consistency evaluation.
As a result, they are not qualified to participate in CP, the resulting sales has decreased. 

Set forth below are our revenues by product category
in millions (USD) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

The revenue of our Anti-Viral/ Infection
 Respiratory product category was 0.67 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.63 million
in the same period last year, which represented an increase of 0.04 million. This increase was mainly due to the increase in sales of
Roxithromycin Dispersible Tablet due to market fluctuation. 

Our CNS Cerebral Cardio Vascular 
product category generated 0.33 million in sales revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.37 million for the

Our Digestive Diseases product category
generated 0.06 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.65 million in the same period last year, which
represented a decrease of 0.59 million. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in sales of Omeprazole, as the market demand returned

Others product category generated
 0.04 million in sales revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.15 million for the same period last year, which
represented a decrease of 0.11 million. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in sales of Vitamin B6 for Injection caused by the
implementation of centralized procurement policy, a stricter drug centralized procurement policy, as well as market fluctuation.

Cost of Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
our cost of revenue was 1.6 million, or 147.2 of total revenue, comparing to 2.0 million, or 112.9 of total revenue, for the same
period in 2023. The decrease in the dollar value of cost of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly because that
the decrease in revenue; and the increase in ratio of costs to revenue was mainly due to the increase in idle equipment costs due to reduced
production, as well as the increased inventory impairments. 

21 

Gross loss and Gross Loss Margin 

Gross loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was 0.52 million, as compared to 0.23 million during the same period in 2023. Our gross loss margin in the three months ended
September 30, 2024 was 47.2 as compared to 12.9 during the same period in 2023. The increase in gross loss is triggered by the decrease
in the revenue as described above. 

Selling Expenses 

Our selling expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.13 million and 0.21 million, respectively. Selling expenses accounted for 12.2 of the total
revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11.5 during the same period in 2023. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses were 0.34
million and 0.25 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and administrative expenses accounted
for 31.4 and 13.7 of our total revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in general
and administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly because that the increase in amortization of intangible
asset. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Our research and development expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.09 million, as compared to 0.05 million in the same period in 2023. Research and development
expenses accounted for 8.0 and 2.5 of our total revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These
expenditures were mainly used for our increased efforts in the consistency evaluations of our existing products. 

Reversal of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

Our reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,656, as compared to 18,212 for the same period in 2023. 

22 

The amount of net accounts receivable that was
past due (or the amount of accounts receivable that was more than 180 days old) was both 0.03 million as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. 

The following tables illustrate our accounts receivable
aging distribution in terms of percentage of total accounts receivable, respective gross accounts receivables as well as the allocated
allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

In general, our normal customer credit or payment
terms are 180 days. This has not changed in recent years. Such relatively long credit term is due to the peculiar environment affecting
the Chinese pharmaceutical market, as deferred payments by state-owned hospitals to local drug distributors are common, and their deferred
payments will indirectly delay the payments from our customers to us. Due to the timeliness requirements of the NMPA for logistics of
drug sales, Helpson, like most other pharmaceutical companies in China, sells substantially all the drugs to local drug distributors,
certified by GSP (Good Supply Practice), the standard of products supply, which is a standard protocol to control the quality of the products
during circulation. These GSP certified distributors then sell the drugs to state-owned hospitals. The GSP certified distributors 
payments to us are usually delayed as they will pay us after they receive payment from the state-owned hospitals. Therefore, as most of
our customers are GSP certified distributors, we adopt a unified policy for bad debt allowance reserves for GMP s customers who
are typically GSP certified distributors. As is typical in the Chinese pharmaceutical market, there are no written contracts between the
Company and any of its GSP certified distributors requesting the distributors to pay the Company s account receivable upon their
receipt of funds from the distributors customers, or state-owned hospitals. Nevertheless, the Company s customers typically
process the payment of the account receivable to the Company upon their receipt of payment from their customers, i.e., the state-owned
hospitals, as a matter of implied consensus or industry standard. In the event the length of collection term is deviated from any of the
past pattern of any particular customer, the Company will adjust its credit term.

Since the fourth quarter of 2018, our bad debt
allowance estimate practice has been updated to a policy that we consider accounts receivable balances aged within 180 days current, except
for any individual uncollectible account assessed by management. We account for the following respective percentage as bad debt allowance
based on age of the accounts receivables: 10 of accounts receivable that is between 180 days and 365 days old, 70 of accounts receivable
that is between 365 days and 720 days old, and 100 of accounts receivable that is greater than 720 days old. 

Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable
was 97.7 and 97.8 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.1 is due to a lower percentage of accounts receivable
over 720 days old. 

We conduct analysis and review on accounts receivables
for customers on a specific, per-customer basis in the fourth fiscal quarter of each fiscal year. For customers (i) whose business license
has been cancelled or expired; (ii) whose key business certificates such as GSP (Good Supply Practice) license have been invalid or revoked;
(iii) who have no ability to continue operations, or (iv) who are encountering other issues that lead to accounts receivable unrecoverable,
the receivable will be written-off as per the resolution of our Board of Directors. 

We recognize bad debt expenses per actual write-offs
as well as changes of allowance for doubtful accounts. To the extent that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is higher than that
of the previous period, we recognize a bad debt expense for the difference during the current period, and when the current allowance is
lower than that of the previous period, we recognize a bad debt credit for the difference. The allowance for doubtful account balances
were 13.9 million and 13.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The changes in the allowances for doubtful
accounts during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

The most significant revenue decrease in terms
of dollar amount was in our Digestive Diseases product category, which generated 0.14 million in sales revenue in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.02 million in the same period last year, a decrease of 0.88 million. This decrease was
mainly due to sales decrease of Omeprazole, as the market demand returned to normal after the demand spiked in the same period of 2023. 

Sales in our Anti-Viral/ Infection 
Respiratory product category generated 2.07 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.11 million
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in sales of Andro-grapholide and Roxithromycin
due to market fluctuation. 

Our CNS Cerebral Cardio Vascular 
product category generated 1.02 million in sales revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.12 million in the
same period last year, which represented a decrease of 0.10 million that was mainly caused by decrease in sales of Candesartan. 

Sales in Other product category
generated 0.16 and 0.62 million in sales revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was
mainly caused by the decrease in sales of Vitamin B6 for Injection caused by the implementation of centralized procurement policy, a stricter
drug centralized procurement policy, as well as market fluctuation.

The Anti-Viral/Infection Respiratory products category represented 61 and 43 of total sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Digestive Diseases category represented 4 and 21 of total revenue

nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

26 

Cost of Revenue 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
our cost of revenue was 5.2 million, or 153.8 of total revenue, comparing to 5.1 million, or 104.2 of total revenue, for the same
period in 2023. 

Gross Loss and Gross Loss Margin 

Gross loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 1.8 million, compared to 0.2 million in the same period in 2023. Our gross loss margin in the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was 53.8 compared to 4.2 in the same period in 2023. The increase in gross loss is triggered by the decrease in the revenue
as described above. 

Selling Expenses 

Our selling expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.35 million and 0.52 million, respectively. Selling expenses accounted for 10.4 of the total
revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.7 in the same period in 2023. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses were 0.93
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.78 million in the same period in 2023. Our general and administrative
expenses accounted for 27.3 and 16.0 of our total revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to the increase in amortization of
intangible asset in this period. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Our research and development expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.28 million and 0.09 million, respectively, representing an increase of 0.19 million
compared to the same period of last year. The increase in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
was mainly due to the increased cost in drug consistency evaluation.

for doubtful accounts)

ended September 30, 2024, and reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts was 24,201 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

2024 was 3.5 million, as compared to 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to the decrease in revenue and increase in cost and expenses. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
loss per basic and diluted common share was 0.23, compared to loss per basic and diluted common share of 0.89 for the nine months ended

The number of basic and diluted weighted-average
outstanding shares used to calculate loss per share was 15,593,445 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2,084,519 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated
from operations and bank lines of credit. Currently the Company has not witnessed or expected to encounter any difficulties to refinance
those lines of credit this year. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregated advance from our CEO was 1,166,294 for use in operations.
Our cash and cash equivalents were 0.72 million, representing 5.3 of our total assets, as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.42
million, representing 8.6 of our total assets as of December 31, 2023. All of the 0.72 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September
30, 2024 are considered to be reinvested indefinitely in the Company s Chinese subsidiary, Helpson and are not expected to be available
for payment of dividends or for other payments to its parent company or to its shareholders. 

28 

The Company obtained various lines of credit in
details described under Note 7 to its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report which is incorporated
by reference herein. 

China Pharma issued a convertible note to an institutional
accredited investor as disclosed in Note 9 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report which
is incorporated by reference herein. 

Although the Company renewed lines of credit in
2024 there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its future strategic goals, including the launch of new products.
This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Although our Chairperson and Chief Executive
Officer had advanced funds for working capital in the third quarter for fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 there can be no assurances
that this will continue in the future. We may seek additional debt or equity financing as necessary when we believe the market conditions
are the most advantageous to us and/or require us to reduce certain discretionary spending, which could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available
on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used by operating activities was 0.70
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.68 million in the same period in 2023. 

As of September 30, 2023, our net accounts receivable
was 0.33 million, compared to 0.50 million as of December 31, 2023. 

Total inventory was 2.5 million and 3.7 million
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Investing Activity 

There was 18,866 used in investing activity during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6,990 for the same period in 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Cash flow provided by financing activities was
 0.02 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024; compared to 0.04 million for the same period in 2023. 

29 

According to relevant PRC laws, companies registered
in the PRC, including our PRC subsidiary, Helpson, are required to allocate at least ten percent (10 of their after-tax net income,
as determined under the accounting standards and regulations in the PRC, to statutory surplus reserve accounts until the reserve account
balances reach fifty percent (50 of the companies registered capital prior to their remittance of funds out of the PRC. Allocations
to these reserves and funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferrable to the parent company in the form of loans,
advances or cash dividends. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Helpson s net assets totaled 5,273,000 and 2,289,000,
respectively. Due to the restriction on dividend distribution to overseas shareholders, the amount of Helpson s net assets that
was designated for general and statutory capital reserves, and thus could not be transferred to our parent company as cash dividends,
was 50 of Helpson s registered capital, which was both 8,145,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The
amount that Helpson must set aside for the statutory surplus fund accounts exceeds its total net assets at September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023. There were no allocations to the statutory surplus reserve accounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The Chinese government also imposes controls on
the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of China. Our businesses and assets are primarily
denominated in RMB. All foreign exchange transactions take place either through the People s Bank of China or other banks authorized
to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the People s Bank of China. Approval of foreign currency
payments by the People s Bank of China or other regulatory institutions requires the submission of a payment application form together
with certain invoices and executed contracts. The currency exchange control procedures imposed by Chinese government authorities
may restrict Helpson, our Chinese subsidiary, from transferring its net assets to our parent company through loans, advances or cash dividends. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management s discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting
policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments. The discussion of our critical accounting policies contained
in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies , included in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company as
defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief
Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as described above. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024
to satisfy the objectives for which they are intended. This was due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting,
with respect to our lack of accounting financial reporting personnel who were knowledgeable in U.S. GAAP, as disclosed in our annual report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Notwithstanding the aforementioned material
weakness, management has concluded that our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report are fairly stated in all
material respects in accordance with U.S. GAAP for each period presented herein. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15
that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
