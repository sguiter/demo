 Equity Method Investments 
 
 The Company s equity method investments include investments in domestic partnerships and offshore funds. The Company evaluates each of its equity method investments to determine if any are significant as defined in the regulations applicable to smaller reporting companies promulgated by the SEC. As of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , no individual equity method investment held by the Company met the significance criteria.

 Changes in net unrealized gain/(loss) included in Net gain/(loss) from investments related to level 3 assets still held as of the reporting date 

Total realized and unrealized gains and losses for Level 3 assets are reported in net gain/(loss) from investments in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were no transfers into or out of Level 3. 
 
 The Company uses a discounted cash flow analysis when determining the fair value of privately issued preferred securities of affiliated closed-end funds that are categorized as Level 3. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow analysis represent the relevant security s dividend rate plus the assumption of full principal repayment at the preferred security s earliest available redemption date. 
 
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of each of the Company s investments in privately issued preferred securities of closed-end funds is the discount rate. The discount rate was determined using the interest rates of U.S. Treasury Bills that are held over a similar period as the preferred security. The discount rates used in the valuation of these investments as of September 30, 2024 ranged from to with a weighted average of calculated based on the relative fair value. Significant changes in the discount rate could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement of these Level 3 investments. 
 
 The Company uses the market approach as the valuation technique to value its investment in common stocks classified as Level 3, specifically considering recent transactions.

The ETR in the year to date periods of 2024 and 2023 differ from the U.S. corporate tax rate of primarily due to (a) deferred tax benefits from a foreign investment, (b) state and local taxes (net of federal benefit) and (c) the deductibility of officers' compensation. The increase in the ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to deferred tax benefits from a foreign investment which reduced the prior year's rate.

and after three and five years, respectively. The Phantom RSAs will be settled by a cash payment, net of applicable withholding tax, on the vesting dates. In addition, an amount equivalent to the cumulative dividends declared on shares of the Company s Class A Stock during the vesting period will be paid to participants on vesting. 

The Phantom RSAs are treated as a liability because cash settlement is required and compensation will be recognized over the vesting period. In determining the compensation expense to be recognized each period, the Company will re-measure the fair value of the liability at each reporting date taking into account the remaining vesting period attributable to each award and the current market value of the Company s Class A Stock. In making these determinations, the Company will consider the impact of Phantom RSAs that have been forfeited prior to vesting (e.g., due to an employee termination). The Company has elected to consider forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 Based on the closing price of the Company s Class A Stock on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the total liability recorded by the Company in compensation payable in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , with respect to the Phantom RSAs was million and million, respectively. 
 
 The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation as well as unrecognized compensation for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MD A OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Introduction 
 
 MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the Company s audited annual financial statements included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024 to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to we, us, our, AC Group or the Company refer collectively to Associated Capital Group, Inc., a holding company, and its subsidiaries through which our operations are actually conducted. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 2015, that provides alternative investment management services and operates a direct investment business that over time invests in businesses that fit our criteria. Additionally, we derive income from proprietary investments. 
 
 Alternative Investment Management 
 
 We conduct our investment management activities through our wholly-owned subsidiary Gabelli Company Investment Advisers, Inc. GCIA and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gabelli Partners, LLC Gabelli Partners ). GCIA is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). GCIA and Gabelli Partners together serve as general partners or investment managers to investment funds, including limited partnerships and offshore companies (collectively, Investment Partnerships and separate accounts. We primarily manage assets across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios and in equity event-driven value strategies. The business earns management and incentive fees from its advisory activities. Management fees are largely based on a percentage of assets under management AUM ). Incentive fees are based on a percentage of the investment returns of certain client portfolios. 
 
 We manage assets on a discretionary basis and invest in a variety of U.S. and foreign securities mainly in the developed global markets. We primarily employ absolute return strategies with the objective of generating positive returns. We serve a wide variety of investors globally including private wealth management clients, corporations, corporate pension and profit-sharing plans, foundations and endowments. 
 
 In merger arbitrage, the goal is to earn absolute positive returns. We introduced our first limited partnership, Gabelli Arbitrage (renamed Gabelli Associates Fund), in February 1985. Our typical investment process begins at the time of deal announcement, buying shares of the target at a discount to the stated deal terms, earning the spread until the deal closes, and reinvesting the proceeds in new deals in a similar manner. By owning a diversified portfolio of transactions, we mitigate the adverse impact of single deal-specific risks. 
 
 As the business and investor base expanded, we launched an offshore version in 1989. Building on our strengths in global event-driven value investing, several investment vehicles have been added to balance investors geographic, strategic and sector-specific needs. Today, we manage investments in multiple categories, including merger arbitrage, long/short value and other strategies. 
 
 Proprietary Capital 
 
 Proprietary capital is earmarked for our direct investment business that invests in new and existing businesses, using a variety of techniques and structures. We launched our direct private equity and merchant banking activities in August 2017. The direct investment business is developing along several core pillars: 

Gabelli Private Equity Partners, LLC GPEP ), formed in August 2017 with 150 million of authorized capital as a fundless sponsor. 

Gabelli Principal Strategies Group, LLC GPS was created in December 2015 to pursue strategic operating initiatives broadly. 

Our direct investing efforts are organized to invest in various ways, including growth capital, leveraged buyouts and restructurings, with an emphasis on small and mid-sized companies. Our investment sourcing is across a variety of channels including direct owners, private equity funds, classic agents, and corporate carve outs (which are positioned for accelerated growth, as businesses seek to enhance shareholder value through financial engineering). The Company s direct investing vehicles allow us to acquire companies and create long-term value with no pre-determined exit timetable.

We have a proprietary portfolio of cash and investments which we expect to use to invest primarily in funds that we will manage, provide seed capital for new products, expand our geographic presence, develop new markets and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances.

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income 
 
 Investment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our funds and accounts, represent our largest source of revenues. Growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and attracts additional investors while maintaining current fee levels. Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service. In light of the ongoing dynamics created by the conflicts in the Middle East and the Ukraine and their impact on the global economy and markets, we could experience higher volatility in the short-term returns of our funds. 
 
 Incentive fees generally consist of an incentive allocation on the absolute gain in a portfolio generally equating to 20 of the economic profit, as defined in the agreements governing the investment vehicle or account. We recognize such revenue only when the measurement period has been completed, generally in December or at the time of an investor redemption. 
 
 Compensation includes variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff. Variable compensation is paid to sales personnel and portfolio management and may represent up to 55 of revenues. 
 
 Management fee expense is incentive-based compensation equal to 10 of adjusted aggregate pre-tax profits paid to the Executive Chair or his designees for his services pursuant to an employment agreement. 
 
 Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs. 
 
 Other income and expense includes net gains and losses from investments (which include both realized and unrealized gains and losses from securities and equity in earnings of investments in partnerships), interest and dividend income, and interest expense. Net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments and from consolidated investment funds. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to third-party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate. Please refer to Notes 1 and 4 in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition 
 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately 898.3 million in cash and investments, net of securities sold, not yet purchased of 7.4 million. This includes 260.9 million of cash and cash equivalents; 115.8 million of U.S. Treasury obligations; 242.3 million of securities, net of securities sold, not yet purchased, including shares of GAMCO Investors, Inc. ("GAMCO") with a market value of 56.4 million; and 279.3 million invested in affiliated and third-party funds and partnerships, including investments in affiliated closed end funds which have a value of 55.0 million and more limited liquidity. Our financial resources provide flexibility to pursue strategic objectives that may include acquisitions, lift-outs, seeding new investment strategies, and co-investing, as well as shareholder compensation in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
 
 Total shareholders equity was 892.8 million or 42.02 per share as of September 30, 2024, compared to 907.0 million or 42.11 per share as of December 31, 2023. Shareholders equity per share is calculated by dividing the total equity by the number of common shares outstanding. The decrease in equity from the end of 2023 was largely attributable to the special 2 per share dividend declared in September 2024.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Total revenues in the third quarter were 2.4 million compared to 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenues generated by the GAMCO International SICAV GAMCO Merger Arbitrage (the SICAV were 1.1 million versus 0.8 million in the prior year period. All other revenues were 1.3 million compared to 1.4 million in the year ago quarter. 
 
 Starting in December 2023, the Company recognized 100 of the merger arbitrage SICAV revenues received by Gabelli Funds, LLC. In turn, AC pays the marketing expenses of the SICAV previously paid by Gabelli Funds, and remits an administrative fee to Gabelli Funds for administrative services provided. This change better aligns the financial arrangements with the services rendered by each party. The net effect of this change had no material impact on our operating results. 
 
 Incentive fees are not recognized until the uncertainty surrounding the amount of variable consideration ends and the fee is crystalized, typically on an annual basis on December 31. Unrecognized incentive fees at September 30, 2024 approximated 2.9 million. There were no material unrecognized incentive fees as of September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Expenses 
 
 Compensation, which includes variable compensation, salaries, bonuses and benefits, was 4.2 million and 4.1 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation accruals on certain proprietary accounts as a result of performance. This increase was offset partially by lower variable based compensation expense in 2024 driven by lower average AUM. 
 
 Management fee expense represents incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10 of income before management fee and income taxes and excluding the impact of consolidating entities and is payable to Mario J. Gabelli, Executive Chair, or his designee pursuant to his employment agreement. Management fee expense of 3.3 million was recorded for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. There was no management fee expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other operating expenses were 1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.7 million in the prior year's quarter driven primarily by marketing expenses on the realigned SICAV. 
 
 Other 
 
 Net gain/(loss) from investments is primarily related to the performance of our securities portfolio and investments in partnerships. Net gain from investments was 26.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of 2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The primary drivers of this quarter's results included gains from our merger arbitrage partnerships and mutual fund holdings. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased to 11.1 million in the 2024 quarter from 6.3 million in the 2023 quarter primarily driven by a 2 per share special dividend declared on our holdings of GAMCO Investors, Inc. 
 
 There were no Shareholder-designated contributions in the 2024 quarter compared to 0.2 million in the 2023 quarter driven by timing of contributions. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate applied to our pre-tax income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 22.9 compared to 60.8 in the 2023 quarter. The difference in effective tax rate period over period is primarily driven by deferred tax expense from a foreign investment which increased the prior year quarter's effective tax rate. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 8.0 million compared to 7.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues generated by the GAMCO International SICAV GAMCO Merger Arbitrage (the SICAV were 4.0 million versus 2.9 million in the prior year period. All other revenues were 4.0 million compared to 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter driven by lower average AUM in 2024.

 Expenses 
 
 Compensation, which includes variable compensation, salaries, bonuses and benefits, was 12.0 million and 11.4 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense in 2024, offset partially by lower variable based compensation expense. 
 
 Management fee expense represents incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10 of income before management fee and income taxes and excluding the impact of consolidating entities and is payable to Mario J. Gabelli, Executive Chair, or his designee pursuant to his employment agreement. Management fee expense was 5.7 million and 3.1 million for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other operating expenses were 5.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.7 million in the prior year period driven primarily by marketing expenses on the realigned SICAV.

Other 
 
 Net gain/(loss) from investments is primarily related to the performance of our securities portfolio and investments in partnerships. Investment gains were 42.8 million in the 2024 period compared to 21.6 million in the 2023 period. 
 
 Interest and dividend income increased to 25.0 million in the 2024 period from 17.5 million in the 2023 period primarily driven by a 2 per share special dividend declared on our holdings of GAMCO Investors, Inc. in September 2024 as well as increased interest income as a result of higher sustained interest rates in the 2024 period. 
 
 Shareholder-designated contributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 0.4 million compared to 1.6 million in the prior year period, driven by timing of contributions. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.1 and 14.3 , respectively. The difference in effective tax rate period over period is primarily driven by deferred tax benefits from a foreign investment which reduced the prior year's effective tax rate 
 
 ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT 
 
 Our revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management and fees associated with our various investment products, rather than our own corporate assets. Assets under management, which are directly influenced by the level and changes of the overall equity markets, can also fluctuate through acquisitions, the creation of new products, and the addition of new accounts or the loss of existing accounts. Since various equity products have different fees, changes in our business mix may also affect revenues. At times, the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices, and this can also impact our revenues. 
 
 Assets under management were 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease from year-end was primarily attributable to investor outflows.

 Our principal assets consist of cash and cash equivalents; treasury securities; marketable securities, primarily equities, including 2.3 million shares of GAMCO; and interests in affiliated and third-party funds and partnerships. Although Investment Partnerships may be subject to restrictions as to the timing of distributions, the underlying investments of such Investment Partnerships are generally liquid, and the valuations of these products reflect that underlying liquidity.

We require relatively low levels of capital expenditures and have a highly variable cost structure where costs increase and decrease based on the level of revenues we receive. Our revenues, in turn, are highly correlated to the level of AUM and to investment performance. We anticipate that our available liquid assets should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements as we build out our operating business. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 260.9 million, Investments in U.S. Treasury Bills of 115.8 million and 242.3 million of investments net of securities sold, not yet purchased of 7.4 million. Included in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 is 2.7 million which is held by consolidated investment funds and may not be readily available for the Company to access. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating cash flows in 2024 are driven by an increase in trading securities of 54.1 million, primarily driven by the investment of cash and cash equivalents into treasuries with maturities in excess of 90 days. In addition, also contributing to the cash used in operating activities was 34.1 million of adjustments for noncash items, primarily gains on investment securities and partnership investments, and 10.4 million of net receivables/payables. These uses of operating cash were partially offset by our net income of 40.1 million and net distributions from partnerships of 12.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities was 3.0 million primarily due to purchases of securities of 9.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales of securities of 5.0 million and return of capital on securities of 1.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was 12.1 million resulting primarily from stock buyback payments of 9.6 million, dividends paid of 2.1 million and redemptions of redeemable noncontrolling interests of 0.4 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 194.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to 191.6 million of net decreases of securities and net distributions from investment partnerships and our net income of 21.4 million, partially offset by 17.8 million of adjustments for noncash items, primarily gains on investments securities and partnership investments and deferred taxes and 0.4 million of net receivables/payables. Net cash provided by investing activities was 2.3 million primarily due to return of capital on securities of 1.2 million and proceeds from sales of securities of 2.2 million, partially offset by purchases of securities of 1.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities was 18.9 million resulting primarily from stock buyback payments of 13.4 million, redemptions of redeemable noncontrolling interests of 3.4 million and dividends paid of 2.2 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. See Note 1 and the Company s Critical Accounting Policies in Management s Discussion and Analysis ("MD A") of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in AC s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024 for details on Critical Accounting Policies.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of and for the period covered by this report. 
 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined by Rule 13a-15(f) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Forward-Looking Information 
 
 Our disclosure and analysis in this report contain some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, and other words and terms of similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance of our products, expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about our business and operations, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations or beliefs include, without limitation: 

the adverse effect from a decline in the securities markets 

a decline in the performance of our products 

a general downturn in the economy 

changes in government policy or regulation 

changes in our ability to attract or retain key employees 

unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory organizations 

We also direct your attention to any more specific discussions of risk contained in our Form 10 and other public filings. We are providing these statements as permitted by the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely to achieve our expectations or if we receive any additional information relating to the subject matters of our forward-looking statements.

ITEM 1: Legal Proceedings 
 
 Currently, we are not subject to any legal proceedings that individually or in the aggregate involved a claim for damages in excess of 10 of our consolidated assets. From time to time, we may be named in legal actions and proceedings. These actions may seek substantial or indeterminate compensatory as well as punitive damages or injunctive relief. We are also subject to governmental or regulatory examinations or investigations. Examinations or investigations can result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief. For any such matters, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the necessary provisions for losses that we believe are probable and estimable. Furthermore, we evaluate whether there exist losses which may be reasonably possible and, if material, make the necessary disclosures. However, management believes such matters, both those that are probable and those that are reasonably possible, are not material to the Company s condensed consolidated financial condition, operations, or cash flows at September 30, 2024.
