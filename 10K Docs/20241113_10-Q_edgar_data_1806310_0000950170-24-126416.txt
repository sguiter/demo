, which had no impact to the Company s par value or issued and authorized capital structure. Taysha is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing AAV-based gene therapies for severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system. Sales Agreement On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with SVB Securities LLC (f/k/a SVB Leerink LLC) and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the Sales Agents ), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time in its sole discretion, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million through the Sales Agents. In March 2022, the Company amended the Sales Agreement to, among other things, include Goldman Sachs Co. LLC as an additional Sales Agent. The Sales Agents may sell common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at-the-market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other existing trade market for the common stock, in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at prices related to prevailing market prices, or any other method permitted by law. The Sales Agents are entitled to receive of the gross sales price per share of common stock sold under the Sales Agreement. In April 2022, the Company sold shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement and received million in net proceeds. other shares of common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement as of September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has incurred operating losses since inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. Losses are expected to continue as the Company continues to invest in its research and development activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. On June 26, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the June 2024 Underwriting Agreement with Jefferies LLC and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters set forth therein (collectively, the Underwriters ), to issue and sell shares of the Company s common stock and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering (the June 2024 Offering ), pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and a related prospectus and prospectus supplement. The offering price to the public was per share of common stock and per pre-funded warrant, which was the price to the public of each share of common stock sold in the June 2024 Offering minus the exercise price per pre-funded warrant. The Underwriters purchased the shares and the pre-funded warrants from the Company pursuant to the June 2024 Underwriting Agreement at a price of per share and per pre-funded warrant, respectively. See Note 10 for additional information. The initial closing of the June 2024 Offering occurred on June 27, 2024. In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters an option to purchase, for a period of 30 days, up to an additional shares of common stock. On July 9, 2024, the Underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional shares of common stock. The total net proceeds from the June 2024 Offering were approximately million, including the proceeds from the Underwriter s option, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of spending on research and development and the market acceptance of the Company s products. The Company will need to obtain additional financing in order to complete clinical studies and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which it receives regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available or will be on terms acceptable to the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of million, which the Company believes will be sufficient to fund its planned operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and its operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to it. As a result, the Company could deplete its capital resources sooner than it currently expects. The Company expects to finance its future cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, preclinical and clinical testing or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects.

The Company s Trinity Term Loans and Success Fee liability are classified as Level 3 measurements under the fair value hierarchy as the fair values were determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair values were determined utilizing a probability-weighted income approach, including variables for the timing of a success event and other probability estimates. See Note 7 for additional information on the Trinity Term Loans and Success Fee. The Company s SSI Warrant liability is classified as Level 3 measurements under the fair value hierarchy as the fair values were determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market.

Depreciation expense was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company committed to a plan to sell specific pieces of equipment originally intended for use in the Company s manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina. The Company determined that this equipment met the requirements to be classified as held for sale. As of September 30, 2023, the equipment sales were expected to be completed within one year. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment loss of million which was the difference between the carrying value and fair value less cost to sell. In September 2024, while continuing efforts to sell these specific pieces of equipment, the Company evaluated its long-lived assets for impairment and determined that the carrying value of the North Carolina manufacturing facility asset group and the held for sale equipment may not be recoverable. The Company recorded a non-cash impairment loss of million. The impairment charge was estimated using a discounted cash flow model and recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

million (the Upfront Payment ). Astellas or any of its affiliates shall have the right, in its or their discretion and upon written notice to the Company, to offset the amount of the Upfront Payment (in whole or in part, until the full amount of the Upfront Payment has been offset) against (a) any payment(s) owed to Taysha or any of its affiliates (or to any third party on behalf of the Company) under or in connection with any license agreement entered into with respect to any GAN Product or Rett Product, including, any upfront payment, milestone payment or royalties owed to Taysha or any of its affiliates (or to any third party on behalf of the Company) under or in connection with any such license agreement or (b) any amount owed to Taysha or any of its affiliates in connection with a Change of Control transaction with Astellas or any of its affiliates. As further consideration for the rights granted to Astellas under the Option Agreement, the Company and Astellas also entered into the Astellas Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined below). Astellas Securities Purchase Agreement On October 21, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Astellas (the Astellas Securities Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to Astellas in a private placement (the Astellas Private Placement ), an aggregate of shares (the Astellas Private Placement Shares ), of its common stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of million. The Astellas Private Placement closed on October 24, 2022. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, in connection with the Astellas Private Placement, Astellas has the right to designate one individual to attend all meetings of the Board in a non-voting observer capacity. The Company also granted Astellas certain registration rights with respect to the Astellas Private Placement Shares. Accounting Treatment In October 2022, upon closing of the Astellas Private Placement and transferring the shares to Astellas, the Company recorded the issuance of shares at fair value. Fair value of the shares transferred to Astellas was calculated in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement by analyzing the Company s stock price for a short period of time prior to and after the transaction date as traded on the NASDAQ. The NASDAQ trading data is considered an active market and a Level 1 measurement under ASC 820. The fair value was determined to be approximately million or per share. The million difference between the million paid by Astellas and the fair market value of shares issued was allocated to the transaction price of the Option Agreement. The Company determined that the Option Agreement falls within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers as the development of TSHA-102 for the treatment of Rett Syndrome and TSHA-120 for the treatment of GAN are considered ordinary activities for the Company. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company evaluated the Option Agreement and identified three separate performance obligations: (1) option to obtain licensing right to GAN, (2) option to obtain licensing right to Rett and (3) performance of research and development activities in the Rett development plan. The transaction price is determined to be million which is comprised of the million Upfront Payment and the million allocated from the Private Placement.

for each of the GAN and Rett options. The SSP of the Rett research and development activities was estimated using an expected cost-plus margin approach. The standalone selling prices of the material rights and Rett research and development activities were then used to proportionately allocate the million transaction price to the three performance obligations. The million transaction price was recorded as deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at the inception of the Astellas Transactions. 

Option to obtain license for GAN 

Rett research and development activities 

Total 

Revenue allocated to the material rights will be recognized at a point in time when each option period expires or when a decision is made by Astellas to exercise or not exercise each option. Revenue from the Rett research and development activities will be recognized as activities are performed using an input method, according to the costs incurred as related to the total costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.

The purchase price per share of common stock was per share (the PIPE Purchase Price ), and the purchase price for the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants was the PIPE Purchase Price minus per Pre-Funded Warrant. The 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have a per share exercise price of , subject to proportional adjustments in the event of stock splits or combinations or similar events. The Pre-Funded Warrants will not expire until exercised in full. The 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants may not be exercised if the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder thereof immediately following such exercise would exceed a specified beneficial ownership limitation; provided, however, that a holder may increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation by giving days notice to the Company, but not to any percentage in excess of . The exercise of the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants was also contingent upon receipt of stockholder approval of an increase in the authorized shares of the Company s common stock (the Stockholder Approval ), which the Company obtained at a special meeting of stockholders held on November 15, 2023. The closing of the August 2023 Private Placement occurred on August 16, 2023 (the PIPE Closing ). The total gross proceeds to the Company at the PIPE Closing were million, and after deducting placement agent commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company, net proceeds were million. The Company used the with-and-without method to allocate the total gross proceeds by first allocating the portion of the proceeds equal to the fair value of the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants on the PIPE Closing date with the remaining proceeds allocated to the PIPE Shares on a residual basis. The Company concluded that at the closing of the August 2023 Private Placement in August 2023, the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants did not meet the criteria for equity classification under the guidance of ASC 815 as the Company did not have sufficient authorized and unissued shares to satisfy the warrants if exercised. The Company recorded the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants as liabilities at their fair value. This liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred million of placement agent commissions and other issuance costs in connection with the August 2023 Private Placement. The placement agent commissions and other issuance costs were allocated between the PIPE Shares and the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants on a systematic basis. The Company allocated million to the PIPE Shares which was recorded as a deduction to additional paid-in capital. The remaining million allocated to the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants were recorded within general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The issuance costs allocated to the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have been added back to net loss when deriving cash flows used in operations, and have been classified as a financing cash outflow in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company recorded a fair value adjustment of million in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the warrant liability of million was reclassified into equity as an increase to additional paid-in capital upon receipt of Stockholder Approval. SSI Warrants In April 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SSI Securities Purchase Agreement ), with two affiliates of SSI Strategy Holdings LLC SSI ), named therein (the SSI Investors pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the SSI Investors in a private placement (the SSI Private Placement ), shares of its common stock (the SSI Shares and warrants (the SSI Warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock (the Warrant Shares ). SSI provides certain consulting services to the Company. Each SSI Warrant has an exercise price of per Warrant Share, which was the closing price of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on April 4, 2023 and expire after issuance. The SSI Warrants issued in the SSI Private Placement provide that the holder of the SSI Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of its SSI Warrants until the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones related to the Company s clinical programs. The SSI Private Placement closed on April 5, 2023. Gross proceeds of the SSI Private Placement were million. The Company concluded that the SSI Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity classification under the guidance of ASC 815 due to settlement provisions that permit the holder to receive a variable number of shares in the event of a specified fundamental transaction as well as provisions that permit the holder to participate in dividends. As the SSI Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity classification, the Company recorded the warrants as liabilities at their fair value. This liability is subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company determined the fair value of the SSI Warrants at issuance was million using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.

 Overview 
 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing AAV-based gene therapies for the treatment of severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS. Our lead clinical program TSHA-102 is in development for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder with no approved disease-modifying therapies that address the genetic root cause of the disease. With a singular focus on developing transformative medicines, we aim to address severe unmet medical needs and dramatically improve the lives of patients and their caregivers. Our management team has proven experience in gene therapy development and commercialization. We leverage this experience, our manufacturing process and a clinically and commercially proven AAV9 capsid in an effort to rapidly translate treatments from bench to bedside. 
 We are evaluating TSHA-102 in the REVEAL Phase 1/2 adolescent and adult trial, which is a first-in-human, open-label, randomized, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of TSHA-102 in adolescent and adult females aged 12 years and older with Rett syndrome due to MECP2 loss-of-function mutation. The trial is taking place in Canada and the United States. We dosed the first two adult patients with Rett syndrome in 2023, and cohort 1 (low dose cohort of 5.7x10 14 total vg) is considered complete. We expect to report an update on safety and efficacy data from cohort 1 in the first half of 2025. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, approved our request to proceed to earlier dose escalation in the adolescent and adult trial, enabling early advancement to cohort 2 (high dose cohort of 1x10 15 total vg). The first patient in cohort 2 was dosed in the second quarter of 2024, and following review of the initial 42-day safety data, the IDMC approved dosing of the second patient in cohort 2 of the adolescent and adult trial. The second patient in cohort 2 was dosed in the third quarter of 2024. The IDMC approved dosing of the third adolescent and adult patient in cohort 2. The third patient in cohort 2 was recently dosed and no safety data has been reported as of the safety cutoff date. TSHA-102 was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, as of the 20-week assessment in the first patient treated in cohort 2 and as of the nine-week assessment in the second patient treated in cohort 2 of the adolescent and adult trial. We expect to report safety and efficacy data from cohort 2 in the first half of 2025. 
 We are also evaluating TSHA-102 in the REVEAL Phase 1/2 pediatric trial, which is an open-label, randomized, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of TSHA-102 in pediatric females with Rett syndrome due to MECP2 loss-of-function mutation. The trial is taking place in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. In 
 28 

August 2024, we announced that Health Canada authorized the Clinical Trial Authorization, or CTA, for TSHA-102 in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome, enabling expansion of the ongoing REVEAL Phase 1/2 pediatric trial into Canada. In late 2023 and early 2024, we dosed the first two pediatric patients, and cohort 1 (low dose cohort of 5.7x10 14 total vg) is considered complete. We expect to report an update on safety and efficacy data from cohort 1 in the first half of 2025. In February 2024, the IDMC approved our request to proceed to earlier dose escalation in the REVEAL pediatric trial, enabling earlier advancement to cohort 2. The first patient in cohort 2 (high dose cohort of 1x10 15 total vg) was dosed in the third quarter of 2024. The IDMC approved dosing of the second patient in cohort 2 of the pediatric trial. The second patient in cohort 2 has been enrolled, and dosing is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. TSHA-102 was generally well tolerated, with no SAEs or DLTs, as of the six-week assessment in the first patient treated in cohort 2 of the REVEAL pediatric trial. We expect to report safety and efficacy data from cohort 2 in the first half of 2025. 
 We have received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and orphan drug designation from the European Commission for TSHA-102 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. We also received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for TSHA-102 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. We also received CTA clearance from the United Kingdom s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or U.K. MHRA, in early 2024 for pediatric patients with Rett syndrome. In February 2024, we received Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway, or ILAP, designation for TSHA-102 from the U.K. MHRA. The ILAP aims to facilitate patient access to novel treatments by accelerating time to market through opportunities for enhanced engagements with U.K. regulatory authorities and other stakeholders. In April 2024, the FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome. RMAT designation followed the FDA s review of available safety and efficacy data from the first three patients with Rett syndrome dosed with the low dose of TSHA-102 (5.7x10 14 total vg) across the REVEAL Phase adolescent and adult trial and the REVEAL Phase 1/2 pediatric trial. RMAT designation was designed to expedite the development and review of regenerative medicine therapies. A regenerative medicine therapy is eligible for RMAT designation if it is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates the therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition. Sponsor companies receiving RMAT designation can benefit from increased interactions with the FDA involving senior managers, with the goal of expediting drug development. We completed a positive initial RMAT Type B multidisciplinary meeting with the FDA regarding the ongoing TSHA-102 development plan in the third quarter of 2024, where we reviewed available clinical, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and nonclinical data with the FDA and discussed our ongoing TSHA-102 development approach. We confirmed alignment on the manufacturing plan and the adequacy of nonclinical data to support a biologics license application submission with the FDA, and we established general alignment with the FDA on the continued development approach and proposed engagement plan with the agency in an effort to expedite the development and review of TSHA-102. 
 
 We completed a CMC-focused Type D with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2024. The FDA endorsed our intended Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, commercial manufacturing process, proposed analytical methods, and corresponding qualification and validation plans, including key mechanism of action potency release assays. We also established analytical comparability between the clinical product and the product derived from the final commercial manufacturing process, and received FDA permission to use the GMP product in future clinical studies of TSHA-102. 
 We have a limited operating history. Since our inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and entering into collaboration agreements for conducting preclinical and clinical development activities for our product candidates. Our lead product candidate is still in the clinical stage. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Through September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily through: (i) the sale of equity, raising an aggregate of 671.0 million of gross proceeds from our initial public offering, or the IPO, sales of common stock pursuant to our Sales Agreement (as defined below), our October 2022 follow-on offering, our 2023 private placement and our June 2024 Offering (as defined below); (ii) pre-IPO private placements of our convertible preferred stock; (iii) our Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) and subsequently the Trinity Term Loan Agreement (as defined below); and (iv) the Astellas Transactions. 
 On November 13, 2023, or the Trinity Closing Date, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Trinity Term Loan Agreement, by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, or the Trinity Lenders, and Trinity Capital Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Trinity Lenders, or Trinity. The Trinity Term Loan Agreement provided for, on the Trinity Closing Date, 40.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans, or, collectively, the Trinity Term Loans. We drew the Trinity Term Loans in full on the Trinity Closing Date. The proceeds of the Trinity Term Loans were used to repay our obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement, or the Term Loan Agreement, with the lenders party thereto from time to time, or the Lenders and Silicon Valley Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders, or the Agent, in full. The Term Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank was terminated concurrently with entry into the Trinity Term Loan Agreement. 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were 70.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 159.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had an 
 29 

accumulated deficit of 583.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 
 continue to advance the clinical development of our product candidates and, if we determine to do so in the future, reprioritize the advancement of our preclinical and discovery programs; 

conduct our ongoing clinical trials of TSHA-102 and any other future product candidates that we advance; 

seek regulatory approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

continue to develop our gene therapy product candidate pipeline; 

scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities; 

work with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture current GMP material for clinical trials or potential commercial sales; 

establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up internal and external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; 

adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products; 

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire additional clinical, manufacturing quality control, regulatory, manufacturing and scientific and administrative personnel; 

add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and 

incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. 

Our Pipeline 
 We are focused on discovering, developing and commercializing gene therapies for the treatment of monogenic diseases of the CNS, in both rare and large patient populations. Our primary focus is advancing our lead TSHA-102 clinical program in Rett syndrome, while our pipeline of CNS programs offers the potential for additional development opportunities in the future. The stage of development of our Rett syndrome program, including the progress in our ongoing clinical trials, is represented in the below table: 

As of the date of this report, we have deprioritized the company-sponsored evaluation of certain clinical-stage programs, including TSHA-105 for SLC13A5, TSHA-118 for CLN1 and TSHA-121 for CLN7, and are seeking external strategic options to potentially enable further development of these programs. In September 2023, we announced that we discontinued the development of our TSHA-120 program in the evaluation for the treatment of GAN. In January 2024, we initiated the transfer of the FDA Investigational New Drug, or IND, application and investigational clinical trial material for TSHA-120 in GAN to clinical trial collaborator the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, enabling the opportunity for continued clinical evaluation of TSHA-120 in GAN by third parties. In July 2024, we terminated our license agreement with Hannah s Hope Fund for Giant Axonal Neuropathy, Inc., or HHF, relating to TSHA-120 and all rights to TSHA-120 reverted to HHF.

TSHA-102 for Rett Syndrome 
 TSHA-102 is a self-complementary intrathecally delivered AAV9 gene transfer therapy in clinical evaluation for Rett syndrome, a rare progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2, or MeCP2, which is essential for regulating neuronal and synaptic function in the brain. The disorder is characterized by loss of communication and hand function, slowing and/or regression of development, motor and respiratory impairment, seizures, intellectual disabilities and shortened life expectancy. Rett syndrome progression is divided into four key stages, beginning with early onset stagnation at 6 to 18 months of age followed by rapid regression, plateau and late motor deterioration. Rett syndrome primarily occurs in females and is one of the most common genetic causes of severe intellectual disability. 
 Designed as a one-time treatment, TSHA-102 aims to address the genetic root cause of the disease by delivering a functional form of MECP2 to cells in the CNS. The vector is delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid via intrathecal administration, which facilitates optimal biodistribution and cell transduction within key regions of the CNS. Because of the risks associated with both under- and over-expression of MeCP2, we have combined high-throughput microRNA, or miRNA, profiling and genome mining to create miRNA-Responsive Auto-Regulatory Element, or miRARE, our novel miRNA target panel. The miRARE element includes binding sites for endogenous miRNA, which are responsive to MeCP2 levels to prevent overexpression. By utilizing the miRARE technology, TSHA-102 is designed to mediate levels of MeCP2 in the CNS on a cell-by-cell basis without risk of overexpression. By increasing MECP2 levels in MECP2 deficient cells and maintaining healthy levels of MECP2 output of healthy cells, TSHA-102 has demonstrated the ability to produce and maintain safe transgene expression levels in the CNS. (Sinnet, SE, et al. Engineered microRNA-based regulatory element permits safe high-dose miniMECP2 gene therapy in Rett mice. Brain. 2021 awab182.) 
 Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies that treat the genetic root cause of Rett syndrome, and there is a significant unmet medical need. According to the Rett Syndrome Research Trust, Rett syndrome affects more than 350,000 patients worldwide. The estimated addressable patient population with typical Rett syndrome caused by a pathogenic/likely pathogenic MECP2 mutation is between 15,000 and 20,000 patients in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom. 
 Phase 1/2 REVEAL Clinical Trials 
 We currently are conducting two Phase 1/2 clinical trials for TSHA-102: an adolescent/adult study in the United States and Canada and a pediatric study in the United States. In addition, approval has been granted to expand the pediatric study into the United Kingdom and Canada. The trials are described below: 
 
 IT Intrathecal; MTD Maximum Tolerated Dose; MAD Maximum Administered Dose. 
 We dosed the first adult patient with Rett syndrome in cohort 1 in May 2023. The second adult patient in cohort 1 was dosed in September 2023. We dosed the first pediatric patient with Rett syndrome in cohort 1 in the Phase 1/2 REVEAL pediatric trial in December 2023, and the second pediatric patient in cohort 1 was dosed in the first quarter of 2024. In early 2024, we announced that the U.K. MHRA authorized the CTA for TSHA-102 in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome, enabling expansion of our ongoing pediatric trial into the United Kingdom. In February 2024, we announced the expansion of the ongoing REVEAL Phase 1/2 adolescent and adult trial in Canada into the United States following submission of the adolescent and adult trial protocol to the FDA. In August 2024, we announced that Health Canada authorized the CTA for TSHA-102 in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome, enabling expansion of the ongoing REVEAL Phase 1/2 pediatric trial in the United States and United Kingdom into Canada. 

Cohort 1, which evaluates the low dose of TSHA-102 of 5.7x10 14 total vg, is considered complete for both REVEAL trials. Two adult patients have been dosed in cohort 1 in the REVEAL adolescent and adult trial, and TSHA-102 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of the 52-week assessment post-treatment for patient one and 36-week assessment post-treatment for patient two. Following review of available clinical data from the first two adult patients and first pediatric patient showing that TSHA-102 was generally well-tolerated, and in light of the potential for improved benefit at the higher dose (1x10 15 total vg), in February 2024, the IDMC, approved our request to proceed to earlier dose escalation in the adolescent and adult trial, enabling earlier advancement to cohort 2 evaluating the 1x10 15 total vg dose. The first patient in cohort 2 of the adolescent and adult trial was dosed in the second quarter of 2024. The second patient in cohort 2 was dosed in the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the IDMC approved dosing of the third patient in cohort 2. The third patient in cohort 2 was recently dosed and no safety data has been reported as of the safety cutoff date. The high dose of TSHA-102 was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, as of the 20-week assessment in the first patient treated in cohort 2 and as of the nine-week assessment in the second patient treated in cohort 2 of the adolescent and adult trial. 
 Additionally, two pediatric patients have been dosed in cohort 1 in the REVEAL pediatric trial, and TSHA-102 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of the 22-week assessment post-treatment for patient one and 11-week assessment post-treatment for patient two. As of the 11-week assessment post-treatment for the second pediatric patient, there were two SAEs reported that were not deemed treatment related. Both were related to underlying disease and one was also attributed to immunosuppression, and both have resolved. In May 2024, the IDMC approved our request to proceed to earlier dose escalation in the REVEAL pediatric trial, enabling earlier advancement to cohort 2 evaluating the 1x10 15 total vg dose, with dosing to occur following IDMC review of the 42-day safety data from the first patient treated with the high dose of TSHA-102 in the adolescent and adult trial. Following review of the initial six-week safety data from the first patient dosed in cohort 2 of the adolescent and adult trial, the IDMC approved the Company to proceed with dosing the first patient in cohort 2 of the pediatric trial. The first pediatric patient in cohort 2 (high dose cohort of 1x10 15 total vg) was dosed in the third quarter of 2024. The IDMC approved dosing of the second patient in cohort 2 of the pediatric trial. The second pediatric patient in cohort 2 has been enrolled, and dosing is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. The high dose of TSHA-102 was generally well tolerated, with no SAEs or DLTs, as of the six-week assessment in the first pediatric patient treated in cohort 2 of the REVEAL pediatric trial. We expect to report safety and efficacy data from cohort 2 and an update on safety and efficacy data from cohort 1 of both the adolescent and adult trial and the pediatric trial in the first half of 2025. 
 The maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, or maximum administered dose, or MAD, established in Part A will be administered during dose expansion in Part B. Data from Part A will be assessed by regulatory agencies and the IDMC to determine key elements of Part B of the study, including efficacy endpoints, study duration and the MTD or MAD. 
 TSHA-102 REVEAL Adolescent / Adult Clinical Trial Safety and Efficacy Summary 
 Efficacy endpoints include patient assessments performed by clinicians, including the Clinical Global Impressions Scale Improvement, or CGI-I, the Clinical Global Impressions Scale Severity, or CGI-S, Rett Syndrome Hand Function Scale, or RSHFS, and Revised Motor Behavior Assessment, or R-MBA. Additional efficacy endpoints also include patient assessments by caregivers, including Parental Global Impressions Improvement, or PGI-I and seizure diaries. The Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire, or RSBQ, is no longer being considered as a primary/secondary endpoint in Part B of our TSHA-102 clinical studies based on discussions with the FDA and focus on more objective endpoints. 
 Overview of Cohort 1 Patients and Results 
 The first adult patient, a 20-year-old female at the time of dosing, has the most advanced stage of Rett syndrome, Stage IV, with a genetic change consisting of a large deletion within the MECP2 gene that is known to cause Rett syndrome. This patient s phenotypic manifestation is severe. She lost the ability to walk, stand, and sit without support by age eight (non-ambulatory, wheelchair bound, limited movements of her lower extremities), lost fine motor and hand function by age six (unable to grasp and hold objects of any size, with essentially no function in non-dominant hand) and speak around age six (non-verbal, minimal vocalizations). She experienced frequent apnea and hyperventilation episodes by age three and has a history of seizures since the age of five. Per the Principal Investigator, or PI, the first adult patient s baseline reported seizure frequency was approximately two to four seizures per year. 
 In the first adult patient, TSHA-102 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of the 52-week assessment post-treatment. Per the protocol, prophylactic immunosuppressant therapy began seven days prior to TSHA-102 administration. The first adult patient s steroid taper was completed by week 36, and her sirolimus taper was completed by week 43. At week 52 post-treatment, the first adult patient demonstrated sustained and new improvements across multiple clinical domains compared to baseline after the completion of her immunosuppression taper. Specifically, the PI reported that the patient sustained improvements in motor function, with the gained ability to kick her legs against gravity and sit unassisted for the first time in over a decade, and sustained improvements in fine motor and hand function with gained function in her non-dominant hand. Additionally, she could open her hands, dissociate her fingers, scratch her nose and touch a screen through week 52 post-treatment. The PI reported sustained improvements in communication and socialization at week 52 post-treatment as the patient was more alert and socially interactive, with increased communication using vocalizations. Caregivers reported an enhanced ability to use an eye-gaze driven communication device at week 25, which she had not expressed interest in before treatment. The first adult patient also demonstrated 

sustained improvements in autonomic function at week 52 post-treatment, including improved breathing patterns with infrequent hyperventilation and fewer breath holding spells compared to before treatment, normalized sleep/night-time behaviors with the ability to sleep through the night for the first time in 20 years, and improved circulation with the patient s hands and feet restored to normal temperature and color (whereas before treatment, her hands and feet were usually cold and blue). The PI also reported that the first patient s seizures were overall well-controlled through week 52 following treatment at lower levels of anti-seizure medication, relative to baseline, and the patient no longer experienced unprovoked seizures. The PI s clinical observations are supported by clinical, caregiver and video evidence. 
 The second adult patient, a 21-year-old female at the time of dosing, has the most advanced stage of Rett syndrome, Stage IV, with a missense mutation in the MECP2 gene, which has been reported to cause Rett syndrome. This patient s phenotypic manifestation is milder than the first adult patient. Prior to treatment, she had partial loss of ambulation (able to walk/stand without support, but she had impaired gait and balance that developed at age 18) and impaired fine motor and hand function (significant stereotypies (repetitive, purposeless hand movements and a diagnostic hallmark of Rett syndrome) that emerged by age three, and she mostly held her hands firmly together, with weak ability to reach and grasp objects). She has been mostly nonverbal since the age of two and experienced frequent hyperventilation episodes by age three. She had a history of seizures since the age of 10. Per the PI, the second adult patient s baseline reported seizure frequency was approximately two to four seizures per week. 
 In the second adult patient, TSHA-102 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of the 36-week assessment post-treatment. The PI reported that the second adult patient demonstrated sustained and new improvements across multiple clinical domains compared to baseline following completion of her steroid taper at week 25 post-treatment. Her sirolimus taper was completed by week 31. She sustained improvements in fine motor skills, with a reduction in hand stereotypies for the first time since regression at age three. Before treatment, the patient mostly held her hands firmly together, and post-treatment, she displays less forceful hand wringing and more open and relaxed hands. The second patient also sustained improvements in communication and socialization through week 25, including increased response to spoken words and eye contact compared to baseline. The PI also reported sustained improvements in autonomic function, with improvements in breathing dysrhythmia, including hyperventilation and reduced apneic spells, and circulation at week 25 post-treatment, evident by the restoration of the patient s hands and feet to normal temperature and color compared to the cold and blue appearance before treatment. Additionally, the second adult patient demonstrated new improvements in gross motor skills at week 25 post-treatment, with improved posture and stability. Notably, she also demonstrated pronounced improvements in seizure frequency at week 25, with a significant reduction in seizures at 25 lower levels of anti-seizure medication, relative to the baseline seizure frequency of two to four seizures per week. Following treatment with TSHA-102, the second patient had a single seizure event, with eight and a half months reported seizure free as of week 36 post-treatment. 
 Adult Patient 1 Efficacy Data (Cohort 1) 
 The first adult patient showed clinically significant improvement in CGI-S from a score of six (severely ill) at baseline to a score of five (markedly ill) in this measure four weeks post-TSHA-102 administration, which was sustained through week 52 post-treatment. Similarly, the patient demonstrated sustained improvement in CGI-I post-TSHA-102 administration with a score of three (minimally improved) at week 52 and new improvement in PGI-I with a score of one (considerably better) as of the week 52 assessment post-TSHA-102 administration. The first adult patient demonstrated continued improvement in RSBQ Total Score at week 52 post-TSHA-102 administration as depicted in the graph below. 

A 35-point improvement was reported in RSBQ Total Score at week 52 compared to baseline, which was driven by improvements in hand behaviors, general mood, breathing, repetitive face movements, body rocking and expressionless face, nighttime behaviors and fear and anxiety. 
 The first adult patient demonstrated continued improvement in R-MBA Total Score at week 52 post-TSHA-102 administration as depicted in the graph below. 
 
 A 17-point improvement was reported in R-MBA Total Score at week 52 compared to baseline, which was driven by improvements in motor dysfunction, functional skills, social skills and respiratory behaviors. 
 Per the seizure diary and caregiver reports, the first adult patient demonstrated stable seizure events relative to baseline through week 52 post-treatment, based on caregiver-reported medical history, and seizures are confined to periods where phenytoin level declines to 100 mol/L to control her seizures. The first adult patient had seizures prior to TSHA-102 administration on day 8 and day 7, and post-administration she had seizures on days 45-49 and day 82 associated with lower than target phenytoin levels. Specifically, the seizures on days 45-49 corresponded with a phenytoin level of 45.9 mol/L, and the seizure on day 82 corresponded with a phenytoin level of 35.9 umol/L. 
 Loss of hand function is a hallmark characteristic of Rett syndrome and a key area of concern for caregivers. It impacts a patient s ability to communicate and impedes daily activities, which ultimately limits independence. The RSHFS is a scale designed to evaluate hand function in patients with Rett syndrome. Hand function is evaluated by an experienced independent physical therapist with expertise in evaluating hand function in patients with Rett syndrome. Sessions are videotaped in which the patient s caregiver offers the patient both large (e.g. a toy, cup, or spoon) and small (e.g. a grape or small piece of sandwich) objects so that she may demonstrate her ability to grasp, pick up, and hold the objects. The independent physical therapist then codes the demonstrated hand function in each video at the demonstrated level of hand function, ranging from no active grasping of any objects to independent grasping and function. 
 The first adult patient showed an improvement in the RSHFS at 25 weeks post-TSHA-102 administration as depicted in the tables below. As of week 25 following treatment, the first adult patient was using her non-dominant hand for some basic grasping whereas before treatment, she was not able to grasp at all. As of the week 25 assessment, her dominant hand function improved from baseline with the demonstrated ability to grasp two different objects (spoon and toy) rather than just one object (spoon). These clinical 

observations reported by the independent physical therapist are supported by video evidence. The RSHFS for week 52 was not completed as of the cutoff date. 
 
 Adult Patient 2 Efficacy Data (Cohort 1) 
 While the two adult patients dosed in cohort 1 in our REVEAL trial both have the most advanced stage of Rett syndrome, Stage IV, they possess different genetic backgrounds and mutation types, which manifest in different phenotypes and clinical severity. 
 While there was no change at week 25 post-TSHA-102 administration in the second adult patient s CGI-S baseline score of four (moderately ill), her CGI-I and PGI-I scores showed sustained improvement at week 25 (score of three, minimally improved and a little better, respectively) post-TSHA-102 administration. 
 An increase in RSBQ Total Score was reported at week 25 post-TSHA-102 administration as depicted in the graph below. 
 
 A two-point increase was reported in the RSBQ Total Score at week 25 compared to baseline. Improvements in RSBQ were reported by caregivers in breathing and general mood. However, there was an increase in hand behaviors and fear and anxiety compared to baseline, impacting the total score. 

The second adult patient demonstrated continued improvement in the R-MBA Total Score at week 25 post-TSHA-102 administration as depicted in the graph below. 
 
 A 23-point improvement was reported in the R-MBA Total Score at week 25 compared to baseline. Improvements were reported in all domains, including social skills, respiratory behaviors, seizures, functional skills, motor dysfunction, aberrant behavior, and truncal rocking and stereotypic hand movements. 
 Per the seizure diary and caregiver reports, the second adult patient demonstrated significantly reduced seizure events relative to baseline through 36 weeks post-treatment at 25 lower levels of anti-seizure medication, based on caregiver-reported medical history. Pre-treatment, the second adult patient had approximately two to four seizures per week, and there has been a significant reduction in seizures post-treatment with TSHA-102 as of the 36-week visit. Post-treatment, the second adult patient had a single seizure event on day 13. The seizure was an unknown type, with motor manifestations and lasted less than one minute duration. The patient has been seizure-free for eight and a half months as of the week 36 post-treatment time point. 
 Hand function in the dominant hand for the second adult patient is challenging to interpret due to inconsistency in the video recording. At the week 25 post-treatment assessment, the second adult patient s dominant hand received a hand function score of four, an independent grasp (pick up and hold) and was able to grasp two objects. There was no change reported in the patient s non-dominant hand score at week 25 compared to baseline. However, the rater reported that the patient displayed nice opening of her non-dominant hand and the ability to grasp three objects weakly (hold for about one second). These clinical observations reported by the independent physical therapist are supported by video evidence. 

TSHA-102 REVEAL Phase 1/2 Pediatric Trial Safety and Efficacy Summary 
 Efficacy endpoints include patient assessments performed by clinicians, including CGI-I, CGI-S, R-MBA and Adapted Mullen Scales for Early Learning, or MSEL-A. Additional efficacy endpoints also include patient assessments by caregivers, including PGI-I and seizure diaries. The RSBQ is no longer being considered as a primary/secondary endpoint in Part B of our TSHA-102 clinical studies based on discussions with the FDA and focus on more objective endpoints. 
 Overview of Cohort 1 Patients and Results 
 The first pediatric patient, a six-year-old female at the time of dosing, has Stage III Rett syndrome, with a deletion within her MECP2 gene that manifests as a moderate phenotype. The patient s severity is evident by her clinical presentation at baseline. Prior to treatment, the patient was non-ambulatory (unable to walk without assistance), with impaired gross motor function (could sit unassisted for only up to 30 seconds and stand with support by age three) and impaired fine motor and hand function (lost the ability to use eating utensils at one and half years old and lost pincer grasp by age two). The patient could hold an object for a maximum of 12 seconds at baseline based on medical records and video evidence. She has been mostly non-verbal since the age of one (could use her eye-gaze driven communication device and speak three words inconsistently at baseline). The first pediatric patient experienced breath holding spells and had a history of seizures since three years old. Per the PI, the patient s baseline reported seizure frequency was approximately one seizure every three months. 
 In the first pediatric patient, TSHA-102 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of the 22-week assessment post-treatment. The PI reported significant challenges with adverse events, or AEs, due to the immunosuppressive regimen. As of 12 weeks post-treatment, the PI reported improvements across multiple clinical domains and early evidence of developmental gains, compared to baseline, including fine and gross motor skills, with improved hand function and grasping. The first pediatric patient demonstrated the ability to hold an object in her hand for up to three minutes while moving her arm (compared to baseline where she could hold an object for up to 12 seconds, but would drop objects when she moved her arm), and improved truncal stability and balance with the gained ability to move her leg on her own to better take a step with assistance for the first time and the ability to sit unassisted for one minute (compared to 30 seconds at baseline). In addition, the first pediatric patient showed improvement in oral motor and autonomic function, with improved swallowing and oral intake relative to the use of a gastrostomy tube for feeding at week 12 post-treatment. Importantly, we believe this indicates that TSHA-102 impacts both motor and autonomic function in a coordinated manner to further improve functional capabilities for patients with Rett syndrome impacting activities of daily living. The PI also observed improvements in the patient s communication and socialization, with enhanced use of an eye-gaze driven communication device, including the use of new words, and the gained ability to string multiple words together and identify object functions for the first time. The patient also gained new skills in visual reception and receptive language, including the ability to identify an object from memory, follow two unrelated commands and identify the function of objects and action words, which she was unable to do pre-treatment. Further, the first pediatric patient showed improvements in autonomic function with improved breathing patterns at week 12. The PI observed that the first pediatric patient had stable seizure events as of 22 weeks post-treatment, relative to baseline. 
 The second pediatric patient, a seven-year-old female at the time of dosing, has Stage III Rett syndrome, with a missense mutation in the MECP2 gene that manifests as a milder phenotype as compared to the first pediatric patient, which is reflected in her clinical presentation at baseline as well as her baseline scores across multiple efficacy measures. Prior to treatment, the second patient was ambulatory (could stand and walk independently but developed a mildly apraxic gait at one and half years old, impacting her gait and balance), with impaired fine motor and hand function by age one (could reach, swipe and transfer objects between hands at baseline, but her ability to reach and grasp objects was weak). The patient has been non-verbal since she was one year old (could use her eye-gaze driven communication device at baseline), and she experienced frequent hyperventilation by the age of four and had a history of seizures since the age of three. Per the PI, the patient s baseline reported seizure frequency was approximately two to four seizures daily. 
 In the second pediatric patient, TSHA-102 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of the 11-week assessment post-treatment. As of the 11-week assessment post-treatment for the second pediatric patient, there were two SAEs reported that were not deemed treatment related. Both were related to underlying disease, and one was also attributed to immunosuppression. Both events have resolved. The PI reported significant challenges with AEs due to the patient s immunosuppressive regimen. As of eight weeks post-treatment, the PI observed improvements across multiple clinical domains compared to baseline and early evidence of developmental gains in the second pediatric patient. Specifically, following treatment, the patient showed improvements in fine and gross motor skills, with improved hand function and the ability to reach more quickly, as well as improved gait, speed and stability when walking, with new skills gained that were lost pre-treatment, including the ability to stand up from a chair and walk up a stair. The PI also observed improvements in the patient s communication and socialization, including improved social interest and eye contact. The second pediatric patient also showed improvements in autonomic function, including improved breathing patterns with less hyperventilation and breath holding episodes. The second pediatric patient also had an increase in days reported seizure-free since dosing as of week 11 post-treatment, which was one of the most severe aspects of disease impacting the patient and her caregivers quality of life prior to treatment (although, a new anti-seizure medication was added to the regimen at week four, which has been maintained through week 11). 

Pediatric Patient 1 Efficacy Data (Cohort 1) 
 There was no change at week 12 post-TSHA-102 administration in the first pediatric patient s CGI-S baseline score of five (markedly ill). The patient demonstrated an improvement in CGI-I and PGI-I at week four post-treatment with a score of three (minimally improved and a little better, respectively), which was sustained through week 12. 
 An increase in RSBQ Total Score was reported at week 12 post-TSHA-102 administration compared to baseline as depicted in the graph below. 
 
 A seven-point increase was reported in RSBQ Total Score at week 12 compared to baseline. The first pediatric patient demonstrated an improvement in hand behaviors and fear and anxiety compared to baseline. However, the patient s observed increase in mood changes, body rocking and expressionless face, nighttime behavior, and repetitive face movements also impacted the RSBQ Total Score. These increased behaviors are attributed to impacts of the immunosuppression regimen on the patient, per the PI. 
 The first pediatric patient demonstrated an improvement in R-MBA Total Score at week 12 post-TSHA-102 administration compared to baseline as depicted in the graph below. 
 
 Pediatric patient one s R-MBA week eight assessment was collected week 11. 
 A four-point improvement was reported in R-MBA Total Score at week 12 compared to baseline, which was driven by an improvement in respiratory behavior, aberrant behavior and motor dysfunction. 

Per the seizure diary and caregiver reports, the first pediatric patient demonstrated stable seizure events relative to baseline through 22 weeks post-treatment, based on caregiver-reported medical history. Pre-treatment, the patient had approximately one seizure every three months. Following treatment, the patient had three seizure episodes. The patient has been seizure-free as of week nine following treatment through week 22. 
 The MSEL-A is a standardized cognitive developmental assessment adapted for use in patients with Rett syndrome. The MSEL-A functionally evaluates skills compared to developmental milestones across four subscales, including visual reception - which is one s ability to visually interpret the surrounding environment, receptive language one s ability to comprehend spoken language, fine motor - one s ability to use their hands to manipulate an object and communicate, and expressive language - one s ability to produce language and communication. The MSEL-A is administered by a trained psychologist or psychometrician, and the scores are reviewed by a certified, central rater. 
 The assessment evaluates where patients with Rett syndrome fall on a developmental curve compared to standard developmental milestones. For each domain assessed, the patient s developmental age equivalence is calculated based on standardized developmental norms. 
 At week 12 following treatment with TSHA-102, which is the first post-treatment assessment of the MSEL-A, the first pediatric patient showed an improvement in the age equivalence of skills she was able to demonstrate across multiple domains compared to baseline, including visual reception, receptive language and fine motor, with new developmental gains demonstrated, as depicted in the below graph. 
 
 Before treatment, the patient was able to identify objects from a picture, resulting in an age equivalent baseline score of 25 months for visual reception. At week 12 post-treatment, she gained the ability to identify an object from memory based on three choices, resulting in an improvement in the age equivalent score of 26 months at week 12. Additionally, before treatment, the patient was able to follow one unrelated command and comprehend questions from a picture, resulting in an age equivalent baseline score of 22 months for receptive language. 
 Post-treatment, she gained the ability to follow two unrelated commands and identify the function of objects and action words, such as eating, sleeping, or washing, resulting in an improvement in her age equivalent score of 24 months at week 12. Further, the patient lost her ability to grasp at age two and displayed limited hand function at baseline, resulting in an age equivalent baseline score of three months for fine motor. At week 12 post-treatment, she gained the ability to use a refined thumb grasp, resulting in an 

improvement in the age equivalent score of five months as noted in the above chart. There was no change in the expressive language score at week 12. 
 The patient was not able to demonstrate these skills before treatment per the MSEL-A baseline assessment, medical history, and caregiver reports. These developmental gains suggest clinically meaningful improvements for the patient as she has generalized these newly gained skills beyond demonstrating them during the MSEL-A assessment. Specifically, per the PI and administrating psychometrician, the patient used her eye-gaze driven communication device to identify object functions while using the device at home, and she held an object for up to three minutes at week 12 compared to up to 12 seconds pre-treatment, which supports her grasping improvements captured on the MSEL-A. 
 Pediatric Patient 2 Efficacy Data (Cohort 1) 
 The two pediatric patients dosed to-date in our REVEAL trial possess different genetic backgrounds and mutation types, which manifest in different phenotypes and clinical severity. 
 There was no change at week eight post-TSHA-102-administration in the second pediatric patient s CGI-S score of four (moderately ill) at baseline. The patient demonstrated an improvement in CGI-I and PGI-I of three (minimally improved and a little better, respectively) at week four. At week eight, the patient demonstrated continued improvement in CGI-I and PGI-I, with a CGI-I score of two (much improved) and a PGI-I score of two (much better). 
 The second pediatric patient demonstrated an improvement in RSBQ Total Score eight weeks post-TSHA-102 administration compared to the week four assessment as depicted in the graph below. RSBQ was not assessed at baseline. 
 
 At week eight, the second pediatric patient demonstrated a 13-point improvement in RSBQ Total Score, compared to week four, which was driven by improvements in breathing, repetitive face movements, nighttime behaviors, and fear and anxiety. 
 The second pediatric patient demonstrated an improvement in R-MBA Total Score at week eight post-TSHA-102 administration compared to baseline as depicted in the graph below. 

At week eight, the second pediatric patient demonstrated an 11-point improvement in R-MBA Total Score. The most notable improvements were reported in respiratory behaviors, seizures and truncal rocking. 
 Per the seizure diary and caregiver reports, the second pediatric patient had an increase in days reported seizure-free since dosing through 11 weeks post-treatment, based on caregiver-reported medical history. Pre-treatment, the patient had approximately two to four seizures per day, with a medical history of seizure disorder including prior hospitalizations for seizure control since the age of three. Two weeks post-TSHA-102, the patient demonstrated a reduction in seizure frequency, with several days reported seizure-free. The patient experienced an episode of seizures during the week four post-treatment assessment, resulting in hospitalization, which was deemed unrelated to TSHA-102 and due to underlying disease, a concurrent urinary tract infection and Propofol sedation for protocol requirement MRI. Although her seizures improved prior to discharge, a new anti-seizure medication was added to the patient s regimen at week four, which she has maintained through week 11 post-treatment. The second pediatric patient had an increase in days reported seizure-free post-treatment since dosing through week 11. 

Deprioritized Programs 
 We have previously deprioritized the evaluation of our clinical product candidates TSHA-105 for SLC13A5, TSHA-118 for CLN1 and TSHA-121 for CLN7. Although we are not currently evaluating the potential of TSHA-105, TSHA-118 and TSHA-121, we may again evaluate any of these in the future as a product candidate as a component of our pipeline expansion plans, or pursue partnerships to advance these programs. 
 TSHA-118 for CLN1 Disease 
 CLN1 disease (one of the forms of Batten disease), a lysosomal storage disorder, is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease with early childhood onset that has an estimated incidence of approximately 1 in 138,000 live births worldwide. The estimated prevalence of CLN1 disease is 1,000 patients in the United States and European Union. CLN1 disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CLN1 gene that encodes the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1, a small glycoprotein involved in the degradation of certain lipid-modified proteins. Loss of function mutations in the CLN1 gene causes accumulation of these lipid-modified proteins in cells, eventually leading to aggregation, neuronal cellular dysfunction and ultimately neuronal cell death. 
 In the infantile-onset form of CLN1 disease, clinical symptoms appear between six to 24 months and include rapid deterioration of speech and motor function, refractory epilepsy, ataxia and visual failure. Infantile-onset CLN1 patients are typically poorly responsive by five years of age and remain noncommunicative until their death, which usually occurs by seven years of age. Late-infantile-onset CLN1 disease begins between two to four years of age with initial visual and cognitive decline followed by the development of ataxia and myoclonus, or quick, involuntary muscle jerks. Juvenile-onset CLN1 disease patients present between the ages of five to ten years old, with vision loss as a first symptom followed by cognitive decline, seizures and motor decline. Approximately 60 of the children diagnosed with CLN1 disease in the United States present with early-onset infantile forms, with the remaining 40 experiencing later-onset childhood forms. 
 All currently available therapeutic approaches for patients with CLN1 disease are targeted towards the treatment of symptoms, and no disease-modifying therapies have been approved. Gene therapy has shown promise in correcting forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses diseases that involve mutations in soluble enzymes, in part, due to cross-correction of neighboring non-transduced cells. 
 We believe that the introduction of a functional CLN1 gene using an AAV9 vector delivered intrathecally to the CNS offers the potential of a disease-modifying therapeutic approach for this disease. TSHA-118 is a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector that expresses human codon-optimized CLN1 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid under control of the chicken -actin hybrid promoter. We acquired exclusive worldwide rights to certain intellectual property rights and know-how relating to the research, development and manufacture of TSHA-118 (formerly ABO-202) in August 2020 pursuant to a license agreement with Abeona Therapeutics Inc., or Abeona. 
 TSHA-118 has been granted orphan drug designation, rare pediatric disease designation and fast track designation from the FDA and orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of CLN1 disease. 
 There is currently an open IND for the CLN1 program. We submitted a CTA filing for TSHA-118 which was approved by Health Canada in 2021. Clinical trial material has been manufactured and released and is now ready for use in a clinical trial setting. We provided investigational clinical trial material for TSHA-118 in CLN1 to support an individual-patient investigator-initiated IND request from RUSH University Medical Center for the treatment of a patient with CLN1 disease. 
 TSHA-105 for SLC13A5 Deficiency 
 TSHA-105 is a gene replacement therapy in development for the treatment of SLC13A5 deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy characterized by the onset of seizures within the first few days of life. SLC13A5 deficiency is caused by bi-allelic loss-of function mutations in the SLC13A5 gene, which codes for a sodium dependent citrate transporter, or NaCT, that is largely expressed in the brain and liver. To date, all tested mutations result in no or a greatly reduced amount of citrate in the cells. Diminished NaCT function leads to loss of neuronal uptake of citrate and other metabolites such as succinate that are critical to brain energy metabolism and function. Affected children have impairments in gross motor function and speech production with relative preservation of fine motor skills and receptive speech. Currently, there are no approved therapies for SLC13A5 deficiency, and treatment is largely to address symptoms. The estimated prevalence of SLC13A5 deficiency is 1,900 patients in the United States and European Union. 
 TSHA-105 is constructed from a codon-optimized human SLC13A5 gene packaged in a self-complementary AAV9 capsid. 
 42 

We have received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA and orphan drug designation from the European Commission for TSHA-105 for the treatment of epilepsy caused by SLC13A5 deficiency. Clinical trial material has been manufactured and released and is now ready for use in a clinical trial setting. 
 Other Programs 
 We have a pipeline of early-stage gene therapy programs targeting CNS diseases that we may progress in the future or advance through potential partnerships. 
 TSHA-113 for Tauopathies 
 We are developing TSHA-113 for the treatment of tauopathies. Tauopathies comprise a large subset of neurodegenerative diseases involving the aggregation of microtubule associated protein tau, or MAPT, protein into neurofibrillary or gliofibrillary tangles in the human brain. These include MAPT-associated frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP, corticobasal degeneration, or CD, and Alzheimer s disease. There are an estimated 11,000 patients in United States and Europe affected by MAPT mediated FTD and 2,000 to 2,500 are affected with MAPT-mediated PSP. and CD , and Alzheimer s disease affects an estimated 6.2 million Americans and 7.8 million Europeans. 
 Intrathecal delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, targeting Tau mRNA by Biogen/Ionis in a Phase 1 study demonstrated durable, robust, time and dose dependent lowering of tau protein and phospho-tau in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer s disease patients. Buoyed by these results, in August 2022, Biogen started a Phase 2 trial in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer s disease. This ASO target validation paved the way for other approaches targeting intercellular tau mRNA (reduce tau protein production), for treating Tauopathies. 
 Unlike an ASO treatment, which would require repeat lifelong administration, we are developing a one-time treatment for Tauopathies. TSHA-113 is an AAV9 capsid that packages a tau-specific miRNA and is delivered in the cerebrospinal fluid for the treatment of tauopathies. This miRNA targets all six isoforms of tau mRNA. 
 We tested the efficacy of TSHA-113 in PS19 mice, a validated mouse model for tauopathies. These mice express human MAPT, and they exhibit significant tau pathology, neurodegeneration, loss of body weight and progressive hind-limb paralysis around nine to 12 months of age. We tested efficacy of our treatment by delivering TSHA-113 to PS19 mice at three months, six months and nine months of age via intracisterna magna injection. We found that the tau mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced by TSHA-113 treatment. Consistently, the tau seeding assay showed reduced levels of pathological tau in brains from PS19 mice treated with TSHA-113. In addition, TSHA-113 treatment was able to rescue the survival rate, loss in body weight, and the hind limb clasping phenotype in the PS19 mice when treated at three months, six months and nine months of age. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a one-time, vectorized delivery of a tau-specific miRNA is a promising approach for treatment for tauopathies. Ongoing and future work is focused on optimal dose determination for IND-enabling studies. 
 TSHA-106 for Angelman syndrome 
 We are developing TSHA-106 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a maternal deficiency of the UBE3A gene. Angelman syndrome is characterized by profound developmental delay, ataxia and gait disturbance, sleep disorder, seizures, heightened anxiety, aggression and severe speech impairments. Angelman syndrome affects approximately one per 12,000 to 20,000 patients worldwide. 
 Angelman syndrome is an imprinting disorder in which the maternal gene is deficient and the paternal copy of UBE3A is intact but silenced by a long non-coding RNA, UBE3A antisense transcript, or UBE3A-ATS. Delivery of an ASO targeting UBE3A-ATS showed promising results in ameliorating Angelman syndrome symptoms in a transgenic mouse model. 
 We have in-licensed a novel gene replacement therapy from University of North Carolina. This novel construct is designed to express two isoforms of UBE3A mRNA from the same codon optimized transgene cassette and could potentially be a one-time treatment for the disease. The unique design feature allows short and long hUBE3A isoforms expression at a near-endogenous 3:1 (short/long) ratio, a feature that could help to support optimal therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, this construct uses human Synapsin 1 promoter, to limit UBE3A expression primarily in neurons, the primary therapeutic target for treating Angelman syndrome. 
 In a published study, this dual isoform expressing cassette was packaged into PHP.B capsids and administered by intracerebroventricular injections in neonatal mice models. This treatment significantly improved motor learning and innate behaviors in Angelman syndrome mice (PMID: 34676830). It rendered Angelman syndrome mice resilient to epileptogenesis and associated hippocampal neuropathologies induced by seizure kindling. These results demonstrated the feasibility, tolerability, and therapeutic potential for dual-isoform hUBE3A gene transfer in the treatment of AS in mice. 

To advance these findings into translatable interventions, our collaborators packaged the dual isoform expressing cassette into AAV9 capsids and undertook animal proof of concept studies. Overall, these results are highly consistent with the published data describing neonatal ICV delivery of a similar dose of the PHP.B/hUBE3Aopt vector (PMID: 34676830) and support continued development. Ongoing and future work is focused on optimal dose and route of administration determination for IND enabling studies. 
 There are an estimated 55,000 patients with Angelman syndrome in the United States and Europe. 
 TSHA-114 for Fragile X Syndrome 
 We are developing TSHA-114 for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome, the most common single gene cause of autism and cognitive impairment, affecting about one in 6,000 individuals worldwide. Fragile X syndrome is diagnosed around three years of age and characterized by anxiety, aggression, hyperactivity, attention deficits and sleep and communication disruption. 
 Fragile X syndrome is caused by a pathological expansion of a CGG triplet repeat in the 5 untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Expansion of the triplet above the normal 5 55 repeats to 200 or more causes hypermethylation of the gene promoter, and shutdown of transcription and translation of the encoded protein, fragile X mental retardation protein, or FMRP. The expanded repeat also induces formation of RNA: DNA heteroduplexes that induces epigenetic gene silencing. Although most patients with Fragile X syndrome do not express FMRP, some individuals with the full mutation produce low amounts of the protein (less than 10 of normal levels). FMRP expression in unaffected persons varies greatly from person to person. Current pharmacotherapeutic treatments for Fragile X syndrome are solely directed towards symptom relief. 
 We conducted proof of concept studies in animal models of Fragile X (Fmr1 KO) with TSHA-114. No significant adverse effects were observed in behavioral, serological or pathohistological markers up to 12 months after intrathecal administration of TSHA-114 in wild-type mice. TSHA-114 treated FMRKO showed widespread FMRP expression was observed throughout brain post administration. TSHA-114 treated FMRKO mice showed robust suppression of audiogenic seizures and normalization of fear conditioning behavior. In addition, assessment of circadian locomotor activity revealed restoration of hyperactivity and sleep. Assessment of transgene expression and behavioral responses in individual mice demonstrated correlations between the level of FMRP expression and potential drug efficacy. 
 The results from the study support continued development. Ongoing and future work is focused on optimal dose and route of administration determination for IND enabling studies. 
 There are an estimated 75,000 patients with Fragile X syndrome in the United States and Europe. 
 License Agreements 
 Research, Collaboration and License Agreement with The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center 
 In November 2019, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement, or the UT Southwestern Agreement, with The Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, or UT Southwestern, as amended in April 2020. 
 In connection with the UT Southwestern Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under certain patent rights of UT Southwestern and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under certain know-how of UT Southwestern, in each case to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import licensed products for use in certain specified indications. Additionally, we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under certain patents and know-how of UT Southwestern for use in all human uses, with a right of first refusal to obtain an exclusive license under certain of such patent rights and an option to negotiate an exclusive license under other of such patent rights. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize at least one licensed product. 
 On April 2, 2020, we amended the UT Southwestern Agreement to include the addition of another licensed product and certain indications, and a right of first refusal to us over certain patient dosing patents. No additional consideration was transferred in connection with this amendment. In March 2022, we and UT Southwestern mutually agreed to revise the payment schedules and current performance expectations of the current sponsored research agreements under the UT Southwestern Agreement and defer payments by fifteen months. In December 2023, we and UT Southwestern mutually agreed to terminate specific sponsored research agreements. There are no outstanding payments due for these terminated programs as of September 30, 2024. 
 In connection with the UT Southwestern Agreement, we issued to UT Southwestern 2,179,000 shares of our common stock. We do not have any future milestone or royalty obligations to UT Southwestern under the UT Southwestern Agreement, other than costs related to the maintenance of patents. 

The UT Southwestern Agreement expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent in such country for such licensed product. After the initial research term, we may terminate the agreement, on an indication-by-indication and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, at any time upon specified written notice to UT Southwestern. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of the agreement or insolvency of the other party. In December 2023, we transferred rights to specific indications back to UT Southwestern. 
 License Agreement with Abeona (CLN1 Disease) 
 In August 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the Abeona CLN1 Agreement, with Abeona Therapeutics Inc., or Abeona. In connection with the Abeona CLN1 Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses under certain patents, know-how and materials originally developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Abeona to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, and commercialize licensed products for gene therapy for the prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of CLN1 Disease (one of the forms of Batten disease) in humans. 
 Subject to certain obligations of Abeona, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one product and commercialize at least one product in the United States. 
 In connection with the license grant, we paid Abeona a one-time upfront license fee of 3.0 million during fiscal year 2020. We are obligated to pay Abeona up to 26.0 million in regulatory-related milestones and up to 30.0 million in sales-related milestones per licensed product and high single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration or revocation or complete rejection of the last licensed patent covering such licensed product in the country where the licensed product is sold, the loss of market exclusivity in such country where the product is sold, or, if no licensed product exists in such country and no market exclusivity exists in such country, ten years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In addition, concurrent with the Abeona CLN1 Agreement, we entered into a purchase and reimbursement agreement with Abeona, pursuant to which we purchased specified inventory from Abeona and reimbursed Abeona for certain research and development costs previously incurred for total consideration of 4.0 million paid in fiscal year 2020. 
 In December 2021, our CTA filing for TSHA-118 for the treatment of CLN1 disease was approved by Health Canada and therefore triggered a 3.0 million regulatory milestone payment in connection with the Abeona CLN1 Agreement. No additional milestone payments were made or triggered during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Abeona CLN1 Agreement expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the expiration of the last royalty term of a licensed product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of the agreement or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the agreement for convenience upon specified prior written notice to Abeona. 
 License Agreement with Abeona (Rett Syndrome) 
 In October 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the Abeona Rett Agreement, with Abeona pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses under certain patents, know-how and materials originally developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Edinburgh and Abeona to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, and commercialize licensed products for gene therapy and the use of related transgenes for Rett syndrome. 
 Subject to certain obligations of Abeona, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one licensed product and commercialize at least one licensed product in the United States. 
 In connection with the Abeona Rett Agreement, we paid Abeona a one-time upfront license fee of 3.0 million during fiscal year 2020. We are obligated to pay Abeona up to 26.5 million in regulatory-related milestones and up to 30.0 million in sales-related milestones per licensed product and high single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration or revocation or complete rejection of the last licensed patent covering such licensed product in the country where the licensed product is sold, the loss of market exclusivity in such country where the product is sold, or, if no licensed product exists in such country and no market exclusivity exists in such country, ten years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. 
 In March 2022, our CTA filing for TSHA-102 for the treatment of Rett Syndrome was approved by Health Canada and therefore triggered a regulatory milestone payment of 1.0 million in connection with the Rett Agreement. In May 2023, we dosed the first patient with TSHA-102 in the Phase 1/2 REVEAL trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of TSHA-102 in adult patients with Rett syndrome and therefore triggered a milestone payment of 3.5 million in connection with the Rett Agreement, which was paid in August 2023. No additional milestone payments were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The Abeona Rett Agreement expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the expiration of the last royalty term of a licensed product in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of the agreement or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the agreement for convenience upon specified prior written notice to Abeona. 
 Option Agreement with Astellas 
 On October 21, 2022, or the Effective Date, we entered into an Option Agreement, or the Option Agreement, with Astellas Gene Therapies, Inc. (f/k/a Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (d/b/a Astellas Gene Therapy)), or Astellas. 
 TSHA-120 Giant Axonal Neuropathy 
 Under the Option Agreement, we granted to Astellas an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty and milestone-bearing right and license (A) to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import, export and otherwise exploit, or, collectively, Exploit or the Exploitation, the product known, as of the Effective Date, as TSHA-120, or the 120 GAN Product, and any backup products with respect thereto for use in the treatment of GAN or any other gene therapy product for use in the treatment of GAN that is controlled by us or any of our affiliates or with respect to which we or any of our affiliates controls intellectual property rights covering the Exploitation thereof, or a GAN Product, and (B) under any intellectual property rights controlled by us or any of our affiliates with respect to such Exploitation, or the GAN Option. Subject to certain extensions, the GAN Option was exercisable from the Effective Date through a specified period of time following Astellas receipt of (i) the formal minutes from the Type B end-of-Phase 2 meeting between us and the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA in response to our meeting request sent to the FDA on September 19, 2022 for the 120 GAN Product, (ii) all written feedback from the FDA with respect to the Type B end-of-Phase 2 Meeting, and (iii) all briefing documents sent by us to the FDA with respect to the Type B end-of-Phase 2 Meeting. Following the receipt of Type C meeting feedback from the FDA regarding a registrational path for TSHA-120 in September 2023, Astellas elected not to exercise the GAN Option, and we recognized revenue related to this expiration during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 TSHA-102 Rett Syndrome 
 Under the Option Agreement, we also granted to Astellas an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty and milestone-bearing right and license (A) to Exploit any Rett Product (as defined below), and (B) under any intellectual property rights controlled by us or any of our affiliates with respect to such Exploitation, or the Rett Option. Subject to certain extensions, the Rett Option is exercisable from the Effective Date through a specified period of time following Astellas receipt of (1) certain clinical data from the female pediatric trial and (2) certain specified data with respect to TSHA-102, or the Rett Option Period and together with the GAN Option, each, an Option, related to (i) the product known, as of the Effective Date, as TSHA-102 and any backup products with respect thereto for use in the treatment of Rett syndrome, and (ii) any other gene therapy product for use in the treatment of Rett syndrome that is controlled by us or any of our affiliates or with respect to which we or any of our affiliates controls intellectual property rights covering the Exploitation thereof, or a Rett Product. 
 The parties have agreed that, if Astellas exercises an Option, the parties will, for a specified period, negotiate a license agreement in good faith on the terms and conditions outlined in the Option Agreement, including payments by Astellas of a to-be-determined upfront payment, certain to-be-determined milestone payments, and certain to-be-determined royalties on net sales of GAN Products and/or Rett Products, as applicable. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was derived from the Astellas Transactions. We recognize revenue as research and development activities related to our Rett program are performed. Revenue related to the material rights associated with the Rett Option and the GAN Option must be recognized at a point in time when the options are exercised or the option period expires. In September 2023, Astellas elected not to exercise the GAN Option, therefore we recognized revenue related to the GAN Option during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 To date, we have not recognized any revenue from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products, if approved, in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all. 

Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of clinical and preclinical development of our product candidates and discovery efforts, including conducting preclinical studies, manufacturing development efforts, preparing for and conducting clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses through asset acquisitions are charged to research and development expense if the licensed technology has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. Research and development expenses include or could include: 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, stock-based compensation, severance costs and other related costs for those employees involved in research and development efforts; 

license maintenance fees and milestone fees incurred in connection with various license agreements; 

external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with consultants, contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites and consultants to conduct our preclinical studies; 

costs related to manufacturing material for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including fees paid to CMOs; 

laboratory supplies and research materials; 

costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and 

facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of facilities, insurance and equipment. 

Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We reduced our research and development and general and administrative spend from 2022 to 2023 but have increased and expect to continue to increase our research and development expenses with respect to the Rett clinical trials for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of TSHA-102 and manufacturing processes and conduct discovery and research activities for our preclinical programs. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. Our clinical development costs are expected to increase significantly as we commence clinical trials. Our future expenses may vary significantly each period based on factors such as: 
 expenses incurred to conduct preclinical studies required to advance our product candidates into clinical development; 

per patient trial costs, including based on the number of doses that patients received; 

the number of patients who enroll in each trial; 

the number of trials required for approval; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 

potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; 

the phase of development of the product candidate; 

third-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; 

the ability to manufacture our product candidates; 

regulators or institutional review boards requiring that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and 

the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation, severance costs, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and audit and tax-related services and insurance costs. 
 We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future as a result of payments for accounting, audit, legal, consulting services, costs associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements, director and officer liability insurance, investor and public relations activities and other expenses associated with operating as a public company to support planned future Rett program development. 
 Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
 Impairment of long-lived assets are the result of an asset group's carrying value exceeding the fair value. In November 2022, we decided not to continue building out our manufacturing facility in North Carolina. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to the construction in progress and right-of-use lease assets at the manufacturing facility. In September 2024, we recorded another impairment charge related to the construction in progress at the manufacturing facility. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) consists primarily of dividends earned from our money market fund and interest income on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense on borrowings under the Trinity Term Loan, and non-cash changes in the fair value of our outstanding warrant liability and the Trinity Term Loan.

Revenue 
 Revenue related to the Astellas Transactions was 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is the result of Rett research and development activities performed during the period. The revenue recorded during the three months 

ended September 30, 2023 is the result of Rett research and development activities performed during the period and the expiration of the material right associated with the GAN Option. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 3.1 million increase was driven by an 0.8 million increase in GMP batch activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is representative of the intended commercial manufacturing process for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome. Additionally, compensation for R D employees increased as a result of increased headcount, and this was partially offset by lower consultant and contractor expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.7 million was primarily due to the issuance costs related to the liability-classified 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants as a result of the August 2023 Private Placement (as defined below) that were expensed in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was partially offset by higher compensation expenses and increases in consulting, professional, and other general and administrative expenses. 
 Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
 
 We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 4.8 million related to our manufacturing facility and assets previously classified as held for sale which are currently being marketed for sale or sublease for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 0.6 million related to assets held for sale for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability was a non-cash gain totaling 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the SSI Warrants. Change in fair value of warrant liability was a non-cash loss totaling 100.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in the fair value of the underlying common stock underlying the SSI Warrants and the 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants. 
 Change in fair value of term loan 
 We elected the fair value option for the Trinity Term Loan and changes to fair value, other than changes that were directly attributed to instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded as a component of other income (expense). The change in fair value was 1.7 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income was primarily attributed to dividends earned from our money market fund following the investment of proceeds raised in our August 2023 Private Placement and our June 2024 Offering. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of approximately 1.3 million was primarily attributed to interest expense incurred under the Term Loan Agreement for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenue 
 Revenue related to the Astellas Transactions was 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is the result of Rett research and development activities performed during the period. The revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is the result of Rett research and development activities performed during the period and the expiration of the material right associated with the GAN Option. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 50.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 6.6 million increase was primarily driven by an increase in GMP batch activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is representative of the intended commercial manufacturing process for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome. This increase was partially offset by a milestone fee payable to Abeona during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 after the dosing of the first adult patient in the TSHA-102 Phase 1/2 REVEAL clinical trial and lower other research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.0 million was primarily due to the 2.6 million in issuance costs allocated to the liability-classified 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the August 2023 Private Placement. This decrease was partially offset by increases in consulting and professional fees. 
 Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
 We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 4.8 million related to our manufacturing facility and assets previously classified as held for sale which are currently being marketed for sale or sublease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 0.6 million related to assets held for sale for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability was a non-cash expense totaling 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the SSI Warrants. Change in fair value of warrant liability was 100.5 million for the nine months ended 

September 30, 2023 due to the increase in the fair value of the common stock underlying the SSI Warrants and the Pre-Funded Warrants. 
 Change in fair value of term loan 
 We elected the fair value option for the Trinity Term Loan and changes to fair value, other than changes that are directly attributed to instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded as a component of other income (expense). The change in fair value was 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income was primarily attributed to dividends earned from our money market fund following the investment of proceeds raised in our August 2023 Private Placement and our June 2024 Offering. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of approximately 4.2 million was primarily attributed to interest expense incurred under the Term Loan Agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 157.7 million. We have funded our operations primarily through equity financings, raising an aggregate of 671.0 million in gross proceeds from equity financings, including from pre-IPO private placements of convertible preferred stock, our IPO, and subsequent sales of common stock in public and private securities offerings, our term loans and the Astellas Transactions. 
 On the Trinity Closing Date, we entered into the Trinity Term Loan Agreement, by and among us, the Trinity Lenders, and Trinity. The Trinity Term Loan Agreement provided for, on the Trinity Closing Date, 40.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans, or, collectively, the Trinity Term Loans. We drew the Trinity Term Loans in full on the Trinity Closing Date. The interest rate applicable to the Trinity Term Loans is the greater of (a) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus 4.50 or (b) 12.75 per annum. The Trinity Term Loans are interest only from the Trinity Closing Date through 36 months from the Trinity Closing Date, which may be extended to 48 months from the Trinity Closing Date upon the satisfaction of certain milestones set forth in the Trinity Term Loan Agreement, after which we are required to pay equal monthly installments of principal through November 13, 2028, or the Maturity Date. The Trinity Term Loans may be prepaid in full (i) from the Trinity Closing Date through November 13, 2024, with payment of a 3.00 prepayment premium, (ii) from November 13, 2024 through November 13, 2025, with payment of a 2.00 prepayment premium, and (iii) from November 13, 2025 through, but excluding, the Maturity Date, with payment of a 1.00 prepayment premium. On the Trinity Closing Date, we paid Trinity a commitment fee of 1.00 of the original principal amount of the Trinity Term Loans. Upon repayment in full of the Trinity Term Loans, we will pay Trinity an end of term payment equal to 5.00 of the original principal amount of the Trinity Term Loans. 
 The obligations under the Trinity Term Loan Agreement are secured by a perfected security interest in all of our assets except for certain customarily excluded property pursuant to the terms of the Trinity Term Loan Agreement. There are no financial covenants and no warrants associated with the Trinity Term Loan Agreement. The Trinity Term Loan Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions without the consent of Trinity and the Trinity Lenders which include, among others, incurring or assuming certain debt; merging, consolidating or acquiring all or substantially all of the capital stock or property of another entity; changing the nature of our business; changing our organizational structure or type; licensing, transferring or disposing of certain assets; granting certain types of liens on our assets; making certain investments; and paying cash dividends. The Trinity Term Loan Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, and also includes customary events of default, including payment default, breach of covenants, change of control, and material adverse effects. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5.00 per annum may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and the Trinity Lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and exercise all of its rights and remedies as set forth in the Trinity Term Loan Agreement and under applicable law. The proceeds of the Trinity Term Loans were used to repay our obligations under the Term Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank in full. The Term Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank was terminated concurrently with entry into the Trinity Term Loan Agreement. 
 On October 5, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in relation to the registration of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units or any combination thereof up to a total aggregate offering price of 

350.0 million. We also simultaneously entered into a Sales Agreement, or the Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, or the Sales Agents, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time at our discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 150.0 million through the Sales Agents. In March 2022, we amended the Sales Agreement to, among other things, include Goldman Sachs Co. LLC as an additional Sales Agent. In April 2022, we sold 2,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement and received net proceeds of 11.6 million. No other shares of common stock have been issued and sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 On October 21, 2022, we entered into the Option Agreement with Astellas granting Astellas an exclusive option to obtain exclusive, worldwide, royalty and milestone-bearing rights and licenses related to TSHA-120 and TSHA-102. As partial consideration for the rights granted to Astellas under the Option Agreement, Astellas paid us a one-time payment in the amount of 20.0 million, or the Upfront Payment, in November 2022. 
 Also on October 21, 2022, we entered into a securities Purchase Agreement with Astellas, or the Astellas Securities Purchase Agreement, and together with the Option Agreement, the Astellas Transactions, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to Astellas in a private placement, or the Astellas Private Placement, an aggregate of 7,266,342 shares of our common stock, or the Astellas Private Placement Shares, for aggregate proceeds of approximately 30.0 million. The Astellas Private Placement closed on October 24, 2022. Pursuant to the Astellas Securities Purchase Agreement, in connection with the Astellas Private Placement, Astellas has the right to designate one individual to attend all meetings of the Board in a non-voting observer capacity. We also granted Astellas certain registration rights with respect to the Astellas Private Placement Shares. 
 In October 2022, we closed an underwritten offering of 14,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares of common stock were sold at a price of 1.88 per share, resulting in total net proceeds of 26.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses. In November 2022, the underwriter exercised its option to purchase an additional 765,226 shares of our common stock and we received net proceeds of 1.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In April 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the SSI Securities Purchase Agreement, with two affiliates of SSI Strategy Holdings LLC, or SSI, named therein, or the SSI Investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the SSI Investors in a private placement, or the SSI Private Placement, 705,218 shares of our common stock, or the SSI Shares, and warrants, or the SSI Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 525,000 shares of our common stock, or the Warrant Shares. SSI provides certain consulting services to us. Each SSI Warrant has an exercise price of 0.7090 per Warrant Share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on April 4, 2023. The SSI Warrants issued in the SSI Private Placement provide that the holder of the SSI Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of its SSI Warrants until the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones related to our clinical programs. The SSI Private Placement closed on April 5, 2023. Gross proceeds of the SSI Private Placement were 0.5 million. 
 On August 14, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the August 2023 Securities Purchase Agreement, with certain institutional and other accredited investors, or the Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to the Purchasers in a private placement transaction, or the August 2023 Private Placement, that closed on August 16, 2023: (i) 122,412,376 shares of our common stock and (ii) with respect to certain Purchasers, pre-funded warrants, or the Pre-Funded Warrants, to purchase 44,250,978 shares of common stock in lieu of shares of common stock. The closing of the August 2023 Private Placement, or the PIPE Closing, occurred on August 16, 2023. The total gross proceeds to us at the PIPE Closing were 150.0 million, and after deducting placement agent commissions and offering expenses payable by us, net proceeds were 140.3 million. 
 On June 26, 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement, or the June 2024 Underwriting Agreement, with Jefferies LLC and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters set forth therein, or, collectively, the Underwriters, to issue and sell 14,361,113 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 18,972,221 shares of our common stock, or the June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants, pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and a related prospectus and prospectus supplement, or the June 2024 Offering. The offering price to the public was 2.25 per share of common stock and 2.249 per June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant, which is the price to the public of each share of common stock sold in the June 2024 Offering, minus the 0.001 exercise price per June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant. The Underwriters purchased the shares and the June 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants from us pursuant to the June 2024 Underwriting Agreement at a price of 2.115 per share and 2.114 per pre-funded warrant, respectively. The initial closing of the June 2024 Offering occurred on June 27, 2024 and we received net proceeds of 70.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In addition, we granted the Underwriters an option to purchase, for a period of 30 days, up to an additional 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. On July 9, 2024, the Underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 3,235,000 shares of common stock and we received additional net proceeds of 6.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The total net proceeds received from the June 2024 Offering were 76.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by us. 

Funding Requirements 
 To date, we have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of approved drug products, and we do not expect to generate substantial revenue for at least the next few years. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our ability to generate future revenue will be compromised. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our product candidates, and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates. We reduced spending in 2023, and such reductions have continued in 2024, as a result of our decision to discontinue development of our GAN clinical program. We have increased and expect to continue to increase our research and development expenses, particularly with respect to the Rett clinical trials, for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and manufacturing processes and conduct discovery and research activities for our preclinical programs. If we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our material cash requirements consisted of 30.1 million in total lease payments under our noncancelable leases for equipment, laboratory space and office space. These leases are described in further detail in Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements located in Part I Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our most significant purchase commitments consist of approximately 11.5 million in cancellable purchase obligations to our CROs and other clinical trial vendors. 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements into the fourth quarter of 2026. We will require additional capital to fund the research and development of our product candidates, to fund our manufacturing activities, to fund precommercial activities of our programs and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The assessment of our ability to meet our future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of biological products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the scope, progress, costs and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for TSHA-102 and any current and future product candidates that we advance; 

our ability to access sufficient additional capital on a timely basis and on favorable terms; 

the extent to which we develop, in-license or acquire other product candidates and technologies in our gene therapy product candidate pipeline; 

the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs as we advance them through preclinical and clinical development; 

the number and development requirements of product candidates that we may pursue; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development capabilities and establish a commercial infrastructure; 

the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; 

the costs incurred in defending ourselves in any legal proceedings that we may be subject to; 

the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and 

the costs of operating as a public company. 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. 

Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of product candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available in the near term, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the terms of these equity securities or this debt may restrict our ability to operate. The Trinity Term Loan Agreement contains negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions. Any future additional debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting and restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering into profit-sharing or other arrangements or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 Cash Flows

Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in operating activities of 62.9 million primarily consisted of a net loss of 70.5 million, primarily attributable to our spending on research and development expenses. The net loss of 70.5 million was partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items, primarily stock-based compensation expense of 9.9 million, the impairment charge of 4.8 million related to the North Carolina manufacturing facility and other non-cash items of 2.8 million, net. Additional cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 9.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred revenue of 6.3 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash used in operating activities of 56.9 million primarily consisted of a net loss of 159.3 million, primarily attributable to the loss recorded on the change in fair value of our warrant liability. The net loss of 159.3 million was offset by 115.6 million of adjustments for non-cash items, primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant liability of 100.5 million and stock-based compensation expense of 5.9 million. Additional cash used in operating activities of 13.2 million was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities used 0.4 million of cash primarily attributable to the purchase of lab equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, investing activities used 7.3 million of cash primarily attributable to capital expenditures related to the close out of our manufacturing facility project and payment of a 3.5 million milestone license fee related to the TSHA-102 Rett syndrome program. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided 77.0 million of cash, which is primarily attributable to the closing of the June 2024 Offering. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, financing activities provided approximately 140.6 million of cash, which is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the August 2023 Private Placement, partially offset by the payment of shelf registration costs and other financing transactions. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 

unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. A description of our significant accounting policies is included in our Annual Report. Please read the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conjunction with our audited financial statements and accompanying notes in our Annual Report. 
 Our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates are more fully described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in our Annual Report and in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements located in Part I Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We elected the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. 
 In addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 
 an exception from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 

reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; 

exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

an exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on financial statements. 

We may take advantage of these provisions until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will cease to qualify as an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of: (i) December 31, 2025, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than 1.235 billion in total annual gross revenues, (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30th, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over the prior three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. We have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this Item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was (a) reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and regulations, and (b) communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 In January 2024 and April 2024, the Company was named a nominal defendant in two putative stockholder derivative actions filed by stockholders of the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The lawsuits have since been consolidated and a lead plaintiff has been appointed. In October 2024, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting claims relating to the Company s August 2023 Private Placement against (i) certain of the Company s current and former directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment; and (ii) against certain participants in the Company s August 2023 Private Placement for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek an unspecified award of damages in the Company s favor, plus pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and an award to the plaintiffs for the costs and disbursement of the action, including fees for their attorneys and experts. The Company has not recorded a liability related to these lawsuits because, at this time, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate possible losses or gains or determine whether an unfavorable outcome is either probable or remote. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in additional legal or regulatory proceedings. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 
 Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 19, 2024. Other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in that report . 
 Risks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates 
 Interim top-line and preliminary results from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 
 
 From time to time, we may publish interim top-line or preliminary results from our clinical trials. Interim results from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line results also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. For example, in June 2024, we announced initial clinical data from the first two pediatric patients and interim clinical data from the first two adult patients treated in the Phase 1/2 REVEAL trials of TSHA-102. However, those observations may not endure or be repeated in subsequently dosed patients or any age or disease severity, including patients receiving higher doses of TSHA-102 in either the adolescent/adult or pediatric trial. Initial clinical observations also may not translate into success on primary endpoints of the REVEAL trial. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. 
 Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance Matters 
 We are subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time that may seek material damages or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business. The costs we incur in defending ourselves or associated with settling any of these proceedings, as well as a material final judgment or decree against us, could materially adversely affect our financial condition. 
 We are subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time that may seek material damages or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in January 2024 and April 2024, we were named a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative lawsuits against certain of our current and former directors in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. These lawsuits seek unspecified monetary damages, disgorgement of profits, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, and other relief. See Item 3-Legal Proceedings and Part II, Item 8, Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in our Annual Report and Part I, Item 2, Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. Due to the inherent uncertainties in legal proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. This or any future litigation, regardless of the merits of any such proceeding, could harm our reputation and result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Although we have directors and officers liability insurance, it provides for a substantial retention of liability and is subject to limitations and may not cover a significant portion, or any, of the expenses or liabilities we may incur or be subject to in connection with these lawsuits or other litigation to which we are party. The costs we incur in defending ourselves or associated with settling such proceedings, as well as a 

material final judgment or decree against us, that are not covered by our directors and officers liability insurance could materially adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, additional lawsuits may be filed, the conclusion of which in a manner adverse to us and for which we incur substantial costs or damages not covered by our directors and officers liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.
