 Goodwill impairment ) Write off from sale of assets ) Balance at September 30, 2024 
 Management is required to perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis and upon the identification of a triggering event. Triggering events potentially warranting an interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected revenue, operating results or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company s stock price or market capitalization. While management cannot predict if or when future goodwill impairments may occur, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results, net assets and the Company s cost of, or access t o, capital. The Company did not identify any triggering events indicating a possible impairment of goodwill at September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company experienced a decline in its market capitalization as a result of a sustained decrease in the Company s stock price and also revised its financial projections. The Company considered these items to represent a triggering event and performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023. Based on the results of the test performed as of that date, it was concluded that the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting unit was less than its carrying value, as such, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The non-cash goodwill impairment charges included in the table above, includes million and million recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, related to the disposition of certain immaterial custom rehab technology assets, which closed in the third quarter of 2024. The Company recognized an immaterial loss as a result of this transaction.

 Interest Rate Swaps 
 The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk by converting a portion of its variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate and recognizes these derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The valuation of these derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. To comply with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. 
 Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the Company s derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and the respective counterparties. The Company has determined that the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to its derivative contracts, which determination was based on the fair value of each individual contract, was not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, all of the Company s derivatives held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 7, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , for additional information regarding the Company s derivative instruments.

 ) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Contingent consideration - Level 3 liabilities 
 Warrant Liability 
 The warrant liability represents the estimated fair value of the Company s outstanding private warrants. The fair value of the private warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. See Note 10 , Stockholders' Equity , for additional discussion of the warrant liability and the material assumptions leveraged for the pricing model . 
 Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other than the non-cash goodwill impairment charge discussed in Note 5, Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets , there were no fair value measurements on a non-recurring basis for the Company s non-financial assets.

 million and have a maturity date in January 2026. The Company has designated its swaps as effective cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

There was such reclassification during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 million and million, respectively, was reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognized as a reduction to interest expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

 On September 13, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its then existing credit agreement (as amended, the 2024 Credit Agreement ).

 million term loan (the "2024 Term Loan"), and million in revolving credit commitments (the "2024 Revolver", and together with the 2024 Term Loan, the "2024 Credit Facility") with a million letter of credit sublimit. The 2024 Credit Facility matures in September 2029. However, if the Senior Notes (as defined below) have not been refinanced (to extend the maturity date to a date that is later than December 13, 2029) or repaid in full, on or prior to December 31, 2027, then the 2024 Credit Facility will mature on May 1, 2028; and, if the Senior Notes (as defined below) have not been refinanced (to extend the maturity date to a date that is later than December 13, 2029) or repaid in full, on or prior to December 31, 2028, then the 2024 Credit Facility will mature on May 1, 2029. At the option of the Company, amounts borrowed under the 2024 Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates based upon either the Base Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement), payable quarterly, or Term SOFR (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement), payable monthly or every three months depending on the interest period selected. Interest periods for Term SOFR loans are available for one, three, or six months at the option of the Company. Base Rate loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a) the Base Rate determined on each day (subject to a zero percent floor), plus an applicable margin ranging from to per annum based on the Company's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement). Term SOFR loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a) Term SOFR for the applicable interest period (subject to a zero percent floor), plus (b) an applicable margin ranging from to per annum based on the Company's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio. The 2024 Revolver carries a commitment fee during the term of the 2024 Credit Agreement ranging from to per annum of the actual daily undrawn portion of the 2024 Revolver depending upon the Company's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio. In connection with the 2024 Credit Agreement, the Company paid financing costs of million. Further, in connection with executing the 2024 Credit Agreement, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of million consisting of lender fees and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Company s then existing credit agreement, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with AdaptHealth Corp. s AdaptHealth or the Company consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this report. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), except as noted. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors , in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. Certain amounts that appear in this section may not sum due to rounding. 
 AdaptHealth Corp. Overview 
 AdaptHealth is a national leader in providing patient-centered, healthcare-at-home solutions including home medical equipment HME ), medical supplies, and related services. The Company focuses primarily on providing (i) sleep therapy equipment, supplies and related services (including CPAP and bi PAP services) to individuals suffering from obstructive sleep apnea OSA ), (ii) medical devices and supplies to patients for the treatment of diabetes (including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps), (iii) home medical equipment to patients discharged from acute care and other facilities, (iv) oxygen and related chronic therapy services in the home, and (v) other HME devices and supplies on behalf of chronically ill patients with wound care, urological, incontinence, ostomy and nutritional supply needs. The Company services beneficiaries of Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance payors. As of September 30, 2024, AdaptHealth serviced approximately 4.2 million patients annually in all 50 states through its network of approximately 670 locations in 47 states. T h e Company s principal executive offices are located at 220 West Germantown Pike, Suite 250, Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania 19462. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 The cost to manufacture and distribute the equipment and products that AdaptHealth provides to patients is influenced by the cost of materials, labor, and transportation, including fuel costs. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, general inflationary cost increases, supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies. Increases in inflation could impact the overall demand for AdaptHealth s products and services, availability of materials, its costs for labor, equipment and products, shipping, warehousing and other operational overhead and the margins it is able to realize on its products, all of which could have an adverse impact on AdaptHealth s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, it is not certain whether AdaptHealth would be able to pass increased costs onto customers to offset inflationary pressures. AdaptHealth has experienced inflationary pressure and higher costs as a result of increased cost of materials, labor and transportation. The increase in the cost of equipment and products is due in part to higher cost of shipping and general inflationary cost increases. Although there have been increases in inflation, AdaptHealth cannot predict whether these trends will continue. AdaptHealth s mitigation efforts relating to these inflationary pressures include utilizing AdaptHealth s purchasing power in negotiations with vendors and the increased use of technology to drive operating efficiencies and control costs, such as AdaptHealth s digital platform for prescriptions, orders and delivery. 
 
 Key Components of Operating Results 
 Net Revenue . Net revenue is recognized for services and related products that AdaptHealth provides to patients for home healthcare equipment, medical supplies to the home and related services. AdaptHealth' s primary product lines are (i) sleep therapy equipment, supplies and related services (including CPAP and bi PAP services) to individuals suffering from OSA, (ii) medical devices and supplies to patients for the treatment of diabetes (including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps), (iii) home medical equipment to patients discharged from acute care and other facilities, (iv) oxygen and related chronic therapy services in the home, and (v) other HME devices and supplies on behalf of chronically ill patients with wound care, urological, incontinence, ostomy and nutritional supply needs. Revenues are recognized either at a point in time for the sale of supplies and disposables, over the service period for equipment rental (including, but not limited to, CPAP machines, hospital beds, wheelchairs and other equipment), net of implicit price concessions for amounts estimated to be received from patients or under reimbursement arrangements with Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors, including private insurers, or in the month in which eligible members are entitled to receive healthcare services in connection with at-risk capitation arrangements. Certain trends or uncertainties that may have a material impact on revenue growth and operating results include the Company's ability to obtain new patient starts and to generate referrals from patient referral sources and the ability to meet the increased demand considering inflationary pressures.

 Cost of Net Revenue. Cost of net revenue primarily includes the cost of non-capitalized medical equipment and supplies, distribution expenses, labor costs, facilities and vehicle rental costs, revenue cycle management costs and depreciation for capitalized patient equipment. Distribution expenses represent the cost incurred to coordinate and deliver products and services to the patients. Included in distribution expenses are leasing, maintenance, licensing and fuel costs for the vehicle fleet; salaries, benefits and other costs related to drivers and dispatch personnel; and amounts paid to couriers. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of corporate support costs including information technology, human resources, finance, contracting, legal, compliance, equity-based compensation, and other administrative costs.

Amortization expense includes amortization of identifiable intangible assets. 
 
 Factors Affecting AdaptHealth s Operating Results 
 AdaptHealth s operating results and financial performance are influenced by certain unique events during the periods discussed herein, including the following: 
 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 AdaptHealth has a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet that resulted from the business acquisitions AdaptHealth has made. Goodwill is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the occurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially warranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected revenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in AdaptHealth's stock price or market capitalization. Such changes in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating performance, and/or future prospects. AdaptHealth performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year. The impairment assessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. AdaptHealth first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If determined necessary, AdaptHealth applies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors, such as estimates of a reporting unit's fair value, including the revenue growth rates, discount rate, and control premium used to estimate the reporting unit s fair value, and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. 
 Seasonality 
 AdaptHealth s business experiences some seasonality. Its patients are generally responsible for a greater percentage of the cost of their treatment or therapy during the early months of the year due to co-insurance, co-payments and deductibles, and therefore may defer treatment and services of certain therapies until meeting their annual deductibles. In addition, changes to employer insurance coverage often go into effect at the beginning of each calendar year which may impact eligibility requirements and delay or defer treatment. Also, net revenue generated by the Company s diabetes product line is typically higher in the fourth quarter compared to the earlier part of the year due to the timing of when patients meet their annual deductibles and their associated reordering patterns. These factors may lead to lower net revenue and cash flow in the early part of the year versus the latter half of the year. Additionally, the increased incidence of respiratory infections during the winter season may result in initiation of additional respiratory services such as oxygen therapy for certain patient populations. AdaptHealth s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on these and other factors.

 Net Revenue. The comparability of AdaptHealth's net revenue between periods was impacted by certain factors as described below. The table below presents the items that impacted the change in AdaptHealth's net revenue between periods. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Variance 2024 vs. 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue change driver: (Unaudited) Increase from non-acquired growth 1,474 0.2 Increase from acquisitions 353 Total change in net revenue 1,827 0.2 
 Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 805.9 million and 804.0 million, respectively, an increase of 1.8 million, or 0.2 . The increase in net revenue was primarily driven by non-acquired growth of 1.5 million, as well as acquisitions, which increased revenue by 0.4 million. Net revenue from AdaptHealth's sleep product category increased by 11.1 million, or 3.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased patient census driven by strong patient demand for sleep products, including CPAP

 resupply products. In addition, net revenue from AdaptHealth's respiratory product category increased by 12.9 million, or 8.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased patient census driven by strong patient demand for respiratory products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from AdaptHealth's diabetes product category, which decreased by 18.9 million, or 11.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a shift in diabetes patients by certain large commercial insurance and other payors from DME suppliers to dual-benefit and pharmacy-only suppliers, and a decrease in CGM patient census. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales revenue (recognized at a point in time) comprised 63 of total net revenue, compared to 66 of total net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements comprised 33 of total net revenue, compared to 34 of total net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue from capitated revenue arrangements comprised 4 of total net revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net revenue from capitated revenue arrangements was immaterial, and is included in net sales revenue and net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements by core product line.

 Cost of net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 681.9 million and 693.5 million, respectively, a decrease of 11.6 million or 1.7 . The cost of products and supplies decreased by 12.3 million, primarily as a result of lower net sales revenue from AdaptHealth's diabetes product category, partially offset by general inflationary cost increases. Salaries, labor and benefits increased by 0.6 million, primarily due to annual merit increases, offset by a decrease in incentive-based compensation and the impact of cost savings actions implemented in the second half of 2023 resulting in headcount reductions. Patient equipment depreciation decreased by 3.3 million, primarily due to lower net revenue from fixed monthly equipment reimbursements, partially offset by higher medical equipment prices. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to higher distribution expenses, vehicle rental costs, equipment repair costs, and revenue cycle management costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 49.2 million and 45.2 million respectively, an increase of 4.0 million or 8.9 . This increase is primarily due to higher professional and consulting fees, software costs, severance charges, and increased legal reserves, partially offset by lower equity-based compensation expense. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 6.1 in the 2024 period, compared to 5.6 in the 2023 period. General and administrative expenses in the 2024 period included 0.4 million of equity-based compensation expense and other non-recurring expenses of 8.4 million, consisting of 3.2 million of severance charges (primarily related to the separation of the Company's former President), 2.8 million of expenses associated with systems implementation activities, 1.9 million of other net expenses, primarily related to professional and consulting expenses, and 0.5 million of expenses associated with litigation. General and administrative expenses in the 2023 period included 3.5 million of equity-based compensation expense and other non-

 recurring expenses of 7.3 million, consisting of 2.9 million of expenses associated with litigation, 2.3 million of expenses associated with a cost savings program, 1.3 million of expenses associated with systems implementation activities, and 0.8 million of other expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization, excluding patient equipment depreciation. Depreciation and amortization, excluding patient equipment depreciation, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 11.3 million and 14.5 million, respectively, a decrease of 3.3 million, primarily related to lower intangible amortization expense. 
 Goodwill Impairment. The Company did not recognize an impairment to goodwill during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company performed a goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, and based on the results of the test, it was concluded that the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting unit was less than its carrying value, as such, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 511.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets , for additional details. 
 Interest Expense, net. Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 31.4 million and 32.3 million, respectively, a decrease of 0.9 million. Interest expense related to AdaptHealth's credit agreement decreased 1.5 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily as a result of lower interest rates as well as lower average outstanding borrowings in 2024 compared to 2023. Interest expense on AdaptHealth's finance leases increased by 0.7 million in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability . AdaptHealth has outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, as discussed in Note 10, Stockholders Equity , to the accompanying September 30, 2024 interim consolidated financial statements. These warrants are liability-classified, and the change in fair value of the warrant liability represents a non-cash gain in the 2024 and 2023 periods for the change in the estimated fair value of such liability during the respective periods. These warrants expire on November 8, 2024. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consists of lender fees and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with AdaptHealth refinancing its credit facility in 2024. See Note 9, Debt , for additional information. 
 Other Loss, net . The Company did not record other income/loss activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other loss, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 3.5 million of lease termination costs associated with a cost management program and a 0.3 million charge for the increase in the fair value of a contingent consideration liability related to an acquisition, offset by 0.5 million relating to the write-off of certain operating lease liabilities for closed locations. 
 Income Tax Expense/Benefit. Income tax expense and income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.1 million and 34.6 million, respectively. Income tax expense on ordinary income increased due to higher pre-tax income, net of warrant liability fair value adjustments.

 census driven by strong patient demand for respiratory products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from AdaptHealth's diabetes product category, which decreased by 32.1 million, or 6.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a shift in diabetes patients by certain large commercial insurance and other payors from DME suppliers to dual-benefit and pharmacy-only suppliers, and lower net revenue from insulin pumps and supplies as a result of a shift toward more pumps being sold to patients through the pharmacy channel, as well as the effect from manufacturers bringing additional distribution business in-house and a decrease in CGM patient census. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales revenue comprised 64 of total net revenue, compared to 66 of total net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 AdaptHealth uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, to analyze its financial results and believes that they are useful to investors, as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures. In addition, AdaptHealth s ability to incur additional indebtedness and make investments under its existing credit agreement is governed, in part, by its ability to satisfy tests based on a variation of Adjusted EBITDA.

Table of Contents 

 AdaptHealth defines EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to AdaptHealth Corp., plus net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, including patient equipment depreciation. 
 AdaptHealth defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (as defined above), plus equity-based compensation expense, change in fair value of the warrant liability, goodwill impairment, loss on extinguishment of debt, litigation settlement expense, and certain other non-recurring items of expense or income. 
 AdaptHealth defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of net revenue. 
 AdaptHealth believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful to investors in evaluating AdaptHealth s financial performance. AdaptHealth uses Adjusted EBITDA as the profitability measure in its incentive compensation plans that have a profitability component and to evaluate acquisition opportunities, where it is most often used for purposes of contingent consideration arrangements. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of AdaptHealth s liquidity.

 Free Cash Flow 
 AdaptHealth uses free cash flow, which is a financial measure that is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, in its operational and financial decision-making and believes free cash flow is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other interested parties to evaluate AdaptHealth's competitors and to measure the ability of companies to service their debt. AdaptHealth's presentation of free cash flow should not be construed as a measure of liquidity or discretionary cash available to AdaptHealth to fund its cash needs, including investing in the growth of its business and meeting its obligations. 
 Free cash flow should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, this key business metric has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be considered as an alternative to any performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of AdaptHealth s liquidity. 
 AdaptHealth defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of equipment and other fixed assets. For further discussion on free cash flow, including a reconciliation from cash flows provided by operating activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Free Cash Flow below. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 AdaptHealth s principal sources of liquidity are its operating cash flows, borrowings under its credit agreements and other debt arrangements, and proceeds from equity issuances. AdaptHealth has used these funds to meet its capital requirements, which primarily consist of capital expenditures including patient equipment, product and supply costs, salaries, labor, benefits and other employee-related costs, third-party customer service, billing and collections and logistics costs, acquisitions and debt service, and to fund share repurchases. AdaptHealth s future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including its patient volume and revenue growth rates. 
 AdaptHealth s capital expenditures are made in advance of patients beginning service. Certain operating costs are incurred at the beginning of the equipment service period and during initial patient set up. 
 AdaptHealth believes that its expected operating cash flows, together with its existing cash and amounts available under its existing credit agreement, will continue to be sufficient to fund its operations and growth strategies for at least the next twelve months.

 AdaptHealth may seek additional equity or debt financing in connection with the growth of its business, primarily for acquisitions. In addition, economic conditions may cause disruption in the capital markets, which could make financing more difficult and/or expensive. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, AdaptHealth may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is unavailable when desired, AdaptHealth s business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 As of September 30, 2024, AdaptHealth had approximately 100.2 million of cash. 
 In September 2024, AdaptHealth entered into an amendment to its then existing credit agreement (as amended, the "2024 Credit Agreement"). As of September 30, 2024, AdaptHealth had 600.0 million outstanding under the 2024 Credit Agreement. The 2024 Credit Agreement includes a 650 million term loan (the 2024 Term Loan and 300 million in revolving credit commitments with a 55.0 million letter of credit sublimit (the 2024 Revolver , and together with the 2024 Term Loan, the "2024 Credit Facility"). The 2024 Credit Facility matures in September 2029. However, if the 6.125 Senior Notes (as defined below) have not been refinanced (to extend the maturity date to a date that is later than December 13, 2029) or repaid in full, on or prior to December 31, 2027, then the 2024 Credit Facility will mature on May 1, 2028; and, if the 4.625 Senior Notes (as defined below) have not been refinanced (to extend the maturity date to a date that is later than December 13, 2029) or repaid in full, on or prior to December 31, 2028, then the 2024 Credit Facility will mature on May 1, 2029. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding borrowing under the 2024 Term Loan requires quarterly principal repayments of 4.1 million through September 30, 2026, increasing to 8.1 million from December 31, 2026 through June 30, 2029, and the remaining unpaid principal balance is due in September 2029.

Interest periods for Term SOFR loans are available for one, three, or six months at the option of AdaptHealth. Base Rate loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a) the Base Rate determined on each day (subject to a zero percent floor), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50 to 2.25 per annum based on AdaptHealth's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement). Term SOFR loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (a) Term SOFR for the applicable interest period (subject to a zero percent floor), plus (b) an applicable margin ranging from 1.50 to 3.25 per annum based on AdaptHealth's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio. The 2024 Revolver carries a commitment fee during the term of the 2024 Credit Agreement ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 per annum of the actual daily undrawn portion of the 2024 Revolver depending upon AdaptHealth's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio. 
 Under the 2024 Credit Agreement, AdaptHealth is subject to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose operating and financial restrictions on AdaptHealth. Financial covenants include a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, both as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement. The 2024 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to make payments when due thereunder, failure to observe or perform certain covenants, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency-related events, and non-compliance with healthcare laws. AdaptHealth was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the 2024 Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 Any borrowing under the 2024 Credit Agreement may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, and any amounts repaid under the 2024 Revolver may be reborrowed. Mandatory prepayments are required under the 2024 Revolver when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed the total commitments for revolving credit loans. Mandatory prepayments are also required in connection with certain dispositions of assets and receipt of certain insurance proceeds or condemnation awards to the extent proceeds thereof are not reinvested, and unpermitted debt transactions.

 Free Cash Flow 
 The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities 144,405 98,833 391,424 325,400 Purchases of equipment and other fixed assets (59,556) (77,086) (228,719) (248,816) Free cash flow 84,849 21,747 162,705 76,584 
 Free cash flow w as 84.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in free cash flow was due to higher net cash provided by operating activities, primarily due to a net increase in the source of cash from operating assets and liabilities. Free cash flow during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by cash collections of accounts receivable from certain pending claims related to the Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident (see further discussion below). The increase in free cash flow was also, to a lesser extent, due to a decrease in, and timing of, purchases of patient medical equipment for operating requirements. 
 Free cash flow was 162.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 76.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in free cash flow was due to higher net cash provided by operating activities, primarily from funds received in connection with AdaptHealth's participation in the Optum Temporary Funding Assistance Program (see further discussion below). The increase in free cash flow was also, to a lesser extent, due to a decrease in, and timing of, purchases of patient medical equipment for operating requirements. 
 As previously disclosed, in February 2024, AdaptHealth learned that a cyber security threat actor had gained access to some of the information technology systems of Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, with which one of AdaptHealth's third-party software providers interfaces in connection with AdaptHealth s claims processing activity. UnitedHealth Group isolated the impacted systems upon learning of this threat and Change Healthcare suspended its claims processing activity with AdaptHealth s software provider. AdaptHealth has worked with its software provider to identify and implement alternative processes to help maintain its claims processing activity. This incident impacted the timing of collection of certain accounts receivable. Pending claims from this incident peaked shortly following the data breach, however, all pending claims have been processed and the impacted accounts receivable balances have been substantially collected by September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, AdaptHealth participated in the Optum Temporary Funding Assistance Program which was designed to provide short-term cash flow relief to providers impacted by the disruption in Change Healthcare s services. As of September 30, 2024, AdaptHealth received 40.7 million under this program which was repaid in October 2024. AdaptHealth has not incurred any fees, interest or other associated costs for participating in the program. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements requires its management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company s management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements which, in 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 turn, could change the results from those reported. In addition, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
 Critical estimates are those that the Company s management considers the most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations because they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company s critical estimates in relation to its consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition and valuation of goodwill. There have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies and critical estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and critical estimates described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business that cover a wide range of matters. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, Accounting for Contingencies , the Company records accruals for such loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If there is no probable estimate within a range of reasonably possible outcomes, the Company s policy is to record at the low end of the range of such reasonably possible outcomes. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews its accruals at least quarterly and adjusts accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. At this time, the Company has no material accruals related to lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, except as disclosed below. While there can be no assurance, based on the Company s evaluation of information currently available, the Company s management believes any liability that may ultimately result from resolution of such loss contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial conditions or results of operations. However, the Company s assessment may be affected by limited information. Accordingly, the Company s assessment may change in the future based upon availability of new information and further developments in the proceedings of such matters. The results of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and material adverse outcomes are possible. Professional legal fees are expensed as they are incurred. 
 
 On July 29, 2021, Robert Charles Faille Jr., a purported shareholder of the Company, filed a purported class action complaint against the Company and certain of its current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for alleged violations of the federal securities laws arising from allegedly false and misleading statements and/or failures to disclose material information regarding changes made to the methodology used to calculate the Company s organic growth trajectory. On October 14, 2021, the court appointed Delaware County Employees Retirement System and the Bucks County Employees Retirement System as Lead Plaintiffs. On November 22, 2021, Lead Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors on behalf of shareholders that purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s stock and options between November 8, 2019 and July 16, 2021 (as to the complaint, the Consolidated Complaint as to the action, the Consolidated Class Action ). The Consolidated Complaint generally alleged that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making allegedly false and misleading statements and/or failing to disclose material information regarding changes made to the methodology used to calculate the Company s organic growth trajectory and the Company s former Co-CEO s alleged tax fraud arising from certain past private activity. The Consolidated Complaint sought unspecified damages. On January 20, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint, which the court denied on June 9, 2022. On June 7, 2023, the court entered an order staying the Consolidated Class Action pending the outcome of a private mediation between the parties. 
 
 On February 26, 2024, the defendants entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement with the Lead Plaintiffs (the Securities Settlement ). On March 5, 2024, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On July 10, 2024, the court entered a judgment approving the class action settlement. The judgment certified the putative class for settlement purpose, found that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate in all respects, and subject to certain exclusions and limitations, released claims on behalf of the settlement class that were asserted or could have been asserted in the Consolidated Class Action against the defendants. The Company s portion of the settlement consists of (i) 32.2 million of cash from the Company s insurance carriers; (ii) 17.8 million of cash from the Company; (iii) 1 million shares of the Company s Common Stock (the Settlement Shares ), which had a fair value of 7.3 million recognized at December 31, 2023; and (iv) the implementation of certain corporate governance reforms. All of the aforementioned cash consideration has been paid consistent with the Securities Settlement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, prior to the court approval of the class action settlement on July 10, 2024, the Company recognized a pre-tax expense of 2.4 million for the change in fair value of the Settlement Shares, which is included in other loss, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In July 2024, the Company issued the Settlement Shares from available Treasury Stock. In connection with the issuance, the Company eliminated the outstanding 9.7 million liability through a reduction to Treasury Stock and Additional paid-in capital of 17.7 million and 8.0 million, respectively. 
 
 On March 7, 2024, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with its directors and officers liability insurers to resolve a proceeding that the Company filed in Delaware Superior Court concerning coverage in connection with the Consolidated Class Action and the Derivative Action discussed immediately below. The insurance settlement exhausted 35.0 million in D O coverage limits available to the Company for the policy period from November 8, 2020 to November 8, 2021. 
 
 On December 6, 2021, a putative shareholder of the Company, Carol Hessler (the Derivative Plaintiff ), filed a shareholder derivative complaint against certain current and former directors and officers of the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (as to the complaint, the Derivative Complaint as to the action, the Derivative Action ). The Derivative Complaint generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Company by, among other things, allegedly causing or allowing misrepresentations and/or omissions regarding changes made to the methodology used to calculate the Company s organic growth and the Company s former Co-CEO s alleged criminal activity and engaging in insider trading. The Derivative Complaint also alleges claims for waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. Finally, the Derivative Complaint alleges that certain of the individual defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act by allegedly negligently issuing, causing to be issued, and participating in the issuance of materially misleading statements to stockholders in the Company s Proxy Statements on Schedule DEF 14A in connection with a Special Meeting of Stockholders, held on March 3, 2021, and the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 27, 2021. The Derivative Complaint seeks, among other things, an award of money damages. 
 
 On March 4, 2022, the parties to the Derivative Action stipulated to stay the Derivative Action pending final resolution of the Consolidated Class Action. On March 7, 2022, the court so-ordered the parties stipulation. 
 
 On April 23, 2024, defendants entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement with the Derivative Plaintiff. In exchange for full releases, the proposed settlement consists of (i) 0.9 million in attorneys fees and expenses, which will be funded with cash from the Company; and (ii) the implementation of corporate governance reforms separate from those negotiated in Securities Settlement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a pre-tax expense of 0.9 million associated with the settlement, which is included in other loss, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of 0.9 million relating to the settlement; such liability is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 On June 25, 2024, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, and set the final approval hearing for November 13, 2024. Upon the effectiveness of the proposed settlement, the Company and its directors and officers as well as the other defendants named in the Derivative Complaint will be released from the claims that were asserted or could have been asserted in the Derivative Action, with certain limitations, by class members participating in the settlement. The Company has always maintained, and continues to believe, that it did not engage in any wrongdoing or otherwise commit any violation of federal or state securities laws or other laws. The settlement includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing and is subject to court approval. There can be no assurance that the settlement will be finalized and approved and, even if approved, whether the conditions to settlement will be satisfied, and the actual outcome of this matter may differ materially from the terms of the settlement described herein. 
 
 On May 2, 2022, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York issued a civil investigative demand to a subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3733 ("FCA") surrounding whether the subsidiary submitted false claims in violation of the FCA related to its billing of, and reimbursements from, federal health care programs for ventilators provided to patients from January 1, 2015 to the present. The Company is fully cooperating with the investigation. Given the stage of the investigation, it is not possible to determine whether it will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk relates to fluctuations in interest rates from borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there was 600.0 million outstanding under the 2024 Term Loan , 22.4 million outstanding under letters of credit, and b ased on the financial debt covenants under the 2024 Credit Agreement, the maximum amount the Company could borrow under the 2024 Revolver and remain in compliance with the financial debt covenants under the agreement was 277.6 million. Amounts borrowed under the 2024 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates determined in relation to the Base Rate (as defined) or Term SOFR (as defined), at our option. Due to the interest rates being variable, fluctuations in interest rates may impact our earnings. Based on our current level of debt, we estimate that a 100 basis point change in interest rates would have a 4.6 million a nnual impact on our net income (loss) before taxes.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024 . Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, during the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as further described below in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. The following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting were identified by the Company as of December 31, 2023: 
 
 The Company uses a third-party service provider under a software as a service contract to initiate and process the majority of its revenue transactions. The service provider uses a subservice organization to consolidate and reformat transactional revenue data before it is recorded in the Company s general ledger. The Company obtains from the service provider a System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1 Type 2 report as part of the evidence used in its evaluation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Due to insufficient communication between the Company and the service provider regarding its expectations for controls over the activities of the subservice organization, the SOC 1 Type 2 report for the service provider did not provide evidence of design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of controls over the completeness and accuracy of the Company s transactional revenue data processed by the subservice organization. The Company also did not design and implement such controls on its own. Substantially all manual and automated controls within the revenue process rely on the integrity of the information processed by the third-party service provider and its subservice organization and, therefore, are also considered to be ineffective. 
 
 The Company did not design and implement a three-way match control (comparing the purchase order, delivery receipt, and invoice) over its procurement of medical equipment inventory through a third-party distribution channel. Specifically, because these procurement transactions are initiated through technology that is not integrated with the technology utilized for vendor invoice payments, the Company was not able to reconcile the quantities of the equipment invoiced by its vendors to the quantities actually received which could affect the completeness, existence, and accuracy of the Company s cost of sales and the related accounts payable. 
 
 The Company did not design and implement process-level controls over the determination of excess or obsolete medical equipment and other inventory balances. Specifically, the Company did not have a mechanism in place to track the movement and status of specific medical equipment and other inventory which could affect the valuation of its inventory. 
 
 Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, believes the interim consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financing Reporting 
 
 With respect to the material weaknesses that existed as of December 31, 2023, management continues to take steps to remediate such material weaknesses, including 1) working with the third-party service provider to ensure its SOC 1 Type 2 report includes evidence of implementation and testing of controls for all relevant sub-service providers impacting the revenue transactional data used by the Company, 2) completing the implementation of technology to bring the third-party distribution channel transaction information into one system to facilitate a three-way match of the purchase order, delivery

 receipt and invoice, 3) expanding the implementation of a perpetual inventory system to a larger number of Company locations, and 4) using the information from the perpetual inventory system to support the determination of excess or obsolete medical equipment and other inventory. While management has completed a risk assessment to identify controls, the material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the enhanced controls have been fully implemented and determined to be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except with respect to the changes in connection with the implementation of the initiatives to remediate the material weaknesses noted above, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 We had no sales of unregistered equity securities during the period covered by this report that were not previously reported in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current Report on Form 8-K. In connection with the securities settlement of the consolidated securities class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in the matter styled Delaware County Employees Retirement System, et al. v. AdaptHealth Corp. f/k/a DFB Healthcare Acquisitions Corp., et al., the Company issued one million shares of the Company s common stock (the Settlement Shares in July 2024. The Settlement Shares were issued without registration pursuant to a Section 3(a)(10) exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (see Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies ). 
 There were no purchases of our Common Stock made during the three months ended September 30, 2024 by us or any of our affiliated purchasers as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act.
