In addition, the Prior A R Credit Agreement included a letter of credit sub-limit of up to million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to million. The Prior A R Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on September 22, 2020 and March 29, 2023, to permit the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the purchase of the convertible note hedge transactions (as described in Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), expand the Company s flexibility to make restricted payments (including common stock repurchases), and replace the total net leverage covenant, as well as to remove and replace the interest rate benchmark based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR and related LIBOR-based mechanics with an interest rate benchmark based on the secured overnight financing rate SOFR as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and related SOFR-based mechanics. 
 Omnicell, Inc. entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second A R Credit Agreement on October 10, 2023, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Capital Markets LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC as joint lead arrangers and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Second A R Credit Agreement supersedes the Prior A R Credit Agreement and provides for (a) a revolving credit facility of million (the Current Revolving Credit Facility and (b) an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to an amount equal to the sum of (i) the greater of million and of the adjusted consolidated EBITDA for the last four quarters and (ii) additional amounts subject to pro forma compliance with certain consolidated secured net leverage ratio (the Current Incremental Facility ). In addition, the Second A R Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to million. The Second A R Credit Agreement has an expiration date of October 10, 2028, subject to acceleration under certain conditions, upon which date all remaining outstanding borrowings will be due and payable. 
 Loans under the Current Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at Omnicell, Inc. s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Second A R Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from to per annum based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second A R Credit Agreement), or (b) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus , and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR for an interest period of one month plus , plus an applicable margin ranging from to per annum based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio. Undrawn commitments under the Current Revolving Credit Facility are subject to a commitment fee ranging from to per annum based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio on the average daily unused portion of the Current Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Current Revolving Credit Facility or Current Incremental Facility Omnicell, Inc. is permitted to

 :1) and maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (not to be less than :1). In addition, the Second A R Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default including, but not limited to, failure to pay interest, principal, and fees, or other amounts when due, material misrepresentations or misstatements in any representation or warranty, covenant defaults, certain cross defaults to other material indebtedness, certain judgment defaults, and events of bankruptcy. 
 Omnicell, Inc. s obligations under the Second A R Credit Agreement and, at the election of Omnicell, Inc. and the contracting counterparty, any secured swap obligations and banking services obligations owing to a lender (or an affiliate of a lender) are guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of its and such subsidiary guarantors assets. In connection with entering into the Second A R Credit Agreement, and as a condition precedent to borrowing loans thereunder, Omnicell, Inc. and certain of Omnicell, Inc. s other direct and indirect subsidiaries have entered into certain ancillary agreements, including, but not limited to, a reaffirmation agreement, which amends certain terms of the existing collateral agreement and reaffirms their obligations under the existing guaranty agreement. 
 The refinancing of the Prior Credit Agreement on October 10, 2023 was evaluated in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments. In determining whether the refinancing was to be accounted for as a debt extinguishment or a debt modification, the Company considered whether lenders within the syndicate remained the same or changed and whether the changes in debt terms were substantial. This assessment was performed on an individual lender basis within the syndicate. As a result, the refinancing was accounted for as a modification with the exception of certain lenders that exited the syndicate. The exit of certain lenders resulted in an immaterial write-off of existing unamortized debt issuance costs. The remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to debt modification, along with the new deferred costs, will be amortized over the remaining term of the Second A R Credit Agreement. The Company incurred and capitalized an additional million of debt issuance costs which are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method through 2028. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million of funds available under the Current Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding balance under the Current Revolving Credit Facility. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Note 10. 
 Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 
 On September 25, 2020, the Company completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the Notes ), including the exercise in full of the initial purchasers option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount of the Notes. The Company received proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of million, net of million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. The Notes bear interest at a rate of per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2021. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated September 25, 2020 (the Indenture ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are general senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on September 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased, or converted. 
 The Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (i) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on December 31, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price for the Notes on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate for the Notes on each such trading day; (iii) if the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; and (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as specified in the Indenture. On or after May 15, 2025 until the close of business on

In addition, the Company continues to have the ability to set the specified cash amount per 1,000 principal amount of Notes above . The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 10.2751 shares of the Company s common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of the Company s common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that could occur prior to the maturity date of the Notes or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption in respect of the Notes, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the Notes for a holder who elects to convert its Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or convert its Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the Indenture), as the case may be. 
 If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, holders may require, subject to certain exceptions, the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of September 30, 2024, none of the criteria for a fundamental change or a conversion rate adjustment had been met. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock has been at least of the conversion price for the Notes then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company redeems less than all of the outstanding Notes, at least million aggregate principal amount of Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the date of the relevant notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for in the Notes. 
 The debt issuance costs associated with the Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using an effective interest rate of . As of September 30, 2024, the remaining life of the Notes and the related issuance cost accretion is approximately year. 
 The maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion, including the effect of a fundamental change and subject to other conversion rate adjustments, would be million shares. As of September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the Notes did not exceed the principal amount.

 Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions 
 In connection with the issuance of the Notes in September 2020, the Company entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers of the Notes and certain other financial institutions (the option counterparties with respect to the Company s common stock. 
 The convertible note hedge consists of an option for the Company to purchase up to approximately million shares of the Company s common stock, which is equal to the number of shares of the Company s common stock underlying the Notes, at an initial strike price of approximately per share. The convertible note hedge will expire upon the maturity of the Notes, if not earlier exercised or terminated. The cost of the convertible note hedge was approximately million and was accounted for as an equity instrument, which was recorded in additional paid-in capital in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of million at issuance related to the convertible note hedge transaction. The convertible note hedge is expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. 
 Separately from the convertible note hedge, in September 2020, the Company entered into warrant transactions to sell to the option counterparties warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately million shares of its common stock in the aggregate at an initial strike price of per share. The warrants require net share or net cash settlement upon the Company s election. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately million for the issuance of the warrants, which was recorded in additional paid-in capital at issuance in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The warrants could separately have a dilutive effect to the Company s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of its common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants.

 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, differed from the statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the benefit of the research and development credits and a foreign-derived intangible income FDII benefit deduction, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the non-deductible compensation and equity charges. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development OECD introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS Pillar Two rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15 on multi-national corporations. The rules are effective for the Company s financial year beginning January 1, 2024. These rules did not have an impact on the Company s provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and million, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of accrued interest and penalties was million and million, respectively. 
 The Company files income tax returns in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examinations by taxing authorities, including major jurisdictions such as the United States, Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. With few exceptions, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was no longer subject to U.S., state, and foreign tax examinations for years before 2020, 2019, and 2019, respectively. 
 Although the Company believes it has adequately provided for unrecognized tax benefits, the provisions on these positions may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate changes in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

 OVERVIEW 
 Our Business 
 Omnicell, a leader in transforming the pharmacy care delivery model, is committed to solving the critical challenges inherent in medication management and elevating the role of clinicians within healthcare as an essential component of care delivery. Omnicell is focused on helping its customers to define and deliver a cost effective medication management strategy that is designed to equip and empower pharmacists and nurses to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks, and to drive improved clinical, operational, and financial outcomes across all care settings. We are doing this with an industry-leading medication management infrastructure which includes robotics, smart devices, intelligent software, and expert services. This comprehensive set of solutions provides the critical foundation for customers to realize the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy, a vision defined by pharmacy leaders for improving operational efficiencies and ultimately targeting zero-error medication management. 
 Omnicell solutions are helping healthcare facilities worldwide to reduce costs, improve labor efficiency, establish new revenue streams, enhance supply chain control, support compliance, and move closer to the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy. We sell our product and consumable solutions together with related service offerings. Revenues generated in the United States represented 91 of our total revenues for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 91 and 88 of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Over the past several years, our business has expan ded from a single-point solution to a platform of products and services that will help to further advance the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy. This expansion has resulted in larger deal sizes across multiple products, services, and implementations for customers and, we believe, more comprehensive,

 valuable, and enduring relationships. As our business evolves, we continue to evaluate the metrics and methods we use to measure the success of our business. 
 We utilize bookings as an indicator of the success of our business. We define bookings generally as: (i) the value of non-cancelable contracts f or our connected devices, software products, and Advanced Services (although, for those Advanced Services contracts without a minimum commitment, bookings only include the amount of revenue that has been recognized once the services have been provided); and (ii) for our consumables, the value of orders placed through our Omnicell Storefront online platform or through written or telephonic orders. We typically exclude technical services and other less significant items ancillary to our products and services, such as freight revenue, from bookings. In addition, dependent upon counterparty or credit risk, which is evaluated at the time of contract signing, for a given multi-year subscription contract we may reduce the portion of the contractual commitment booked at a given time. As noted, the portfolio of products, solutions and services we offer has evolved. As a result, the ordering process for certain of our solutions has also evolved. For example, orders for certain solutions may not include a purchase order. Connected devices and software license bookings are recorded as revenue upon customer acceptance of the installation or receipt of goods. Revenues from Advanced Services bookings are recorded over the contractual term. 
 We generally provide installation planning and consulting as part of most connected device product sales, which are typically included in the initial price of the solution. To help ensure the maximum availability of our systems, our customers typically purchase technical services contracts (maintenance and support) in increments of one to five years. In addition to connected device product sales, we provide a range of services to our customers. We also provide Advanced Services such as Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service (service portion), IV Compounding Service (service portion), EnlivenHealth, Specialty Pharmacy Services, 340B solutions, Inventory Optimization Service, and other software solutions, which typically are provided over two to seven years.

 Our full-time employee headcount was approximately 3,660 and 3,650 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Operating Segments 
 We manage our operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of Omnicell at the consolidated level using information about our revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating decisions are based upon an analysis of Omnicell as one operating segment, which is the same as our reporting segment. 
 Business Strategy 
 The U.S. spent a tota l of 634 bil lion on prescription drugs in 2022, an increase of 9 compared to 2021, and pr escription drugs impact the vast majority of patients in virtually all settings of care. We believe there are significant challenges facing the practice of pharmacy today including, but not limited to, budget constraints, increased healthcare worker turnover rates, labor shortages, drug shortages, drug diversion, manual and error-prone processes, complex compliance requirements, and limited inventory visibility. Each of these challenges may lead to poor medication management outcomes including, but not limited to, medication errors, adverse drug events, lack of patient adherence, and medication waste. We also recognize that these challenges may impact the timing of contracting for, or implementing, our products, solutions, or services. However, we believe that over time these significant challenges to the practice of pharmacy will drive demand for increased 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 automation, visibility, insights, and improved medication management outcomes that our solutions are designed to enable. Because of this, we believe that our solutions are well-positioned to address the evolving needs of healthcare institutions and therefore present opportunities for long-term growth. 
 In an effort to address these challenges and deliver solutions to help drive positive medication management outcomes, we continue to make significant investments in our research and development efforts to further advance the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy. Furthermore, we believe a combination of robotics, smart devices, intelligent software, and expert services is needed in every care setting where medications are managed. We are focused on delivering solutions to help our customers realize the industry vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy and drive positive medication management outcomes with outstanding customer experience through a mature channel in four market categories: 
 Point of Care. As a market leader, we expect to continue expansion into this product market as customers increase the use of our dispensing systems in more areas within their hospitals and increasingly in ambulatory care settings. While the macroeconomic environment is showing some signs of improvement, we recognize that some health system customers may still be facing budgetary or labor constraints, which may impact our customers considerations in the near term when they are determining whether to implement new solutions and workflows. As we are largely through the replacement cycle of our previous generation of automated dispensing systems, we are seeing demand moderate. With the launch of next-generation enhancements and solutions for points of care, we believe we are providing a path for customers to maximize the value of their existing technology investments through upgrades and acquisitions of new program offerings for their current installed base. We also believe there is an opportunity for us to expand this offering and define a new standard for dispensing systems in ambulatory settings. We believe our current solutions within the Point of Care market and new innovation and services will continue to help customers drive improved clinical and financial outcomes. 
 Central Pharmacy and IV Compounding. This market represents the beginning of the medication management process in acute care settings, and we believe it is a significant automation opportunity for high volumes of manual, repetitive, and error-prone processes that are often common in pharmacies today. Manual medication dispensing processes are usually labor intensive, error-prone, and may lead to excess medication waste and expirations for our healthcare partners. Automating the central pharmacy dispensing process should enable customers to reallocate pharmacy labor, enhance dispensing accuracy and patient safety, and reduce medication waste and expirations. Likewise, the manual compounding of sterile IV preparations can be error-prone and create significant patient safety risks, and outsourcing sterile IV compounding could lead to increased medication costs and lack of access to needed medications as a result of being unable to source medications when they are required. As a result, we believe IV automation provides a significant opportunity to enhance patient safety and reduce costs. We anticipate that these technology-enabled services will become more critical as health systems continue to face labor shortages, increased financial pressure, and supply chain disruptions. As health systems expand and grow, we find that traditional methods of medication management may lead to multi-vendor environments that may complicate workflows, often creating unnecessary redundancy and increasing chances for potential errors. We believe health systems need a single source for technology and resources that is designed to execute and optimize centralized medication management strategies to better meet current and future health system needs. 
 Specialty Pharmacy and 340B Program. We believe that health systems will continue to invest in programs that are intended to improve patient outcomes and drive cost savings by utilizing specialty pharmacies and the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program (the 340B Program ). The 340B Program allows qualifying hospitals and health systems to stretch federal resources and expand patient access to healthcare by requiring manufacturers participating in Medicaid to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to eligible healthcare organizations and covered entities. Specialty drugs are used for treatment of complex conditions and often require intensive patient management and specialized workflows for dispensing and care coordination. Specialty medications are projected to account for nearly 60 of U.S. total spending on medications, with total spending projected to be approximately 420 billion in 2025. Specialty pharmacies serve as the connection between patients, prescribing physicians, and payers and work to streamline access and adherence to these specialty drugs. We believe a solution that is designed to help health systems start or optimize their specialty pharmacy programs and the related pharmaceutical aspects of patient care will help ensure continuity of care and should contribute to the revenue and profitability of those organizations. We believe that a fully optimized specialty pharmacy operation represents one of the largest economic opportunities for hospitals and health systems. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Retail, Institutional, and Payer. We believe the Retail, Institutional, and Payer market represents a significant opportunity as healthcare evolves. Retail drug prescriptions represent 85 of all prescription drugs dispensed in the U.S., growing at a rate of 2.7 annually through 2024. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift of outpatient care from hospitals and physician offices to other, more convenient settings, such as retail pharmacies and the home (including through telehealth technologies). New technologies and increased scope of practice for pharmacists appear to be spurring innovation and expansion of the provision of clinical services by retail pharmacies, which, combined with the move to value-based care, we believe will drive the adoption of our patient engagement solutions, that are intended to help providers (including pharmacists) and payers engage patients in new ways that are expected to improve outcomes, reduce the total cost of care, and lead to more profitable operations. Because of the complexity of relationships between payers and providers, as well as the large number of retail pharmacies, including a significant number of independent pharmacies, we believe a network of established relationships between payers, providers and pharmacies will continue to be important. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
 We believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: 
 Revenue recognition; 
 Lessor leases; 
 Allowance for credit losses; 
 Inventory; 
 Internal-use and external-use software development costs; 
 Lessee leases; 
 Business combinations; 
 Valuation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; 
 Share-based compensation; and 
 Accounting for income taxes. 
 There were no material changes in the matters for which we make critical accounting estimates in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Total Revenues 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change in 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Product revenues 158,361 188,755 (30,394) (16) Percentage of total revenues 56 63 Service revenues

 Product revenues represented 56 and 63 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product revenues decreased by 30.4 million, primarily due to lower volumes from our automated dispensing systems business primarily as a result of the impact of a continued challenging environment for some of our health system customers and the timing of our XT Series systems lifecycle, as we are largely through the replacement cycle. 
 Service revenues represented 44 and 37 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Service revenues include revenues from technical services and Advanced Services offerings. Service revenues increased by 14.2 million, primarily due to an increase of 2.3 million in technical services revenues as a result of growth in our installed customer base and the impact of pricing actions, as well as an increase of 11.9 million in Advanced Services revenues due to continued customer demand. 
 Our international sales represented 9 of total revenues for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and are expected to be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change in 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Product revenues 448,236 562,906 (114,670) (20) Percentage of total revenues 56 63 Service revenues

 Product revenues represented 56 and 63 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product revenues decreased by 114.7 million, due to lower volumes from our automated dispensing systems business primarily as a result of the impact of a continued challenging environment for some of our health system customers and the timing of our XT Series systems lifecycle, as we are largely through the replacement cycle. 
 Service revenues represented 44 and 37 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Service revenues include revenues from technical services and Advanced Services offerings. Service revenues increased by 31.8 million, primarily due to an increase of 9.6 million in technical services revenues as a result of growth in our installed customer base and the impact of pricing actions, as well as an increase of 22.2 million in Advanced Services revenues due to continued customer demand. 
 Our international sales represented 9 and 12 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are expected to be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Our ability to continue to grow revenues is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain orders from customers, which may be dependent upon customers capital equipment budgets and/or capital equipment approval cycles, our ability to produce quality products and consumables to fulfill customer demand, the volume of installations we are able to complete, our ability to meet customer needs by providing a quality installation experience, our ability to develop new or enhance existing

 solutions, and our flexibility in workforce allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis. The timing of our product revenues for equipment is primarily dependent on when our customers schedules and/or staffing levels allow for installations. 
 Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenues is primarily comprised of three general categories: (i) standard product costs which account for the majority of the product cost of revenues that are provided to customers, and are inclusive of purchased material, labor to build the product, and overhead costs associated with production; (ii) costs of providing services and installation costs, including costs of personnel and other expenses; and (iii) other costs, including variances in standard costs and overhead, scrap costs, rework, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and amortization of software development costs and intangibles.

 Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 6.5 million, primarily driven by a 11.9 million decrease in cost of product revenues, partially offset by a 5.3 million increase in cost of service revenues. 
 The decrease in cost of product revenues was primarily driven by the decrease in product revenues of 30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of product revenues has not decreased proportionally with the decrease in product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of higher margin products as well as the impact of certain fixed costs, such as labor and overhead. In addition, the decrease in cost of product revenues was partially offset by an increase of 0.9 million of restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of service revenues was primarily driven by the increase in service revenues of 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The overall decrease in gross margin primarily relates to lower product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, whereas the decrease in cost of product revenues has not decreased proportionally with the decrease in product revenues, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of higher margin products as well as the impact of certain fixed costs, such as labor and overhead. The decrease in cost of product revenues is partially offset by restructuring costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 122.3 million, as compared to 132.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by 20.7 million, primarily driven by a 37.5 million decrease in cost of product revenues, partially offset by a 16.8 million increase in cost of service revenues. 
 The decrease in cost of product revenues was primarily driven by the decrease in product revenues of 114.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of product revenues has not decreased proportionally with the decrease in product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of higher margin products as well as the impact of certain fixed costs, such as labor and overhead. In addition, the decrease in cost of product revenues was partially offset by 5.4 million of inventory write-down charges related to the RDS product line wind down incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase of 2.9 million of restructuring costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of service revenues was primarily driven by the increase in service revenues of 31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The overall decrease in gross margin primarily relates to lower product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, whereas the decrease in cost of product revenues has not decreased proportionally with the decrease in product revenues, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of higher margin products as well as the impact of certain fixed costs, such as labor and overhead. The decrease in cost of product revenues is partially offset by inventory write-down charges related to the RDS product line wind down and restructuring costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 329.2 million, as compared to 391.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased by 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in employee-related expenses as a result of lower headcount. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 6.6 million in employee-related expenses as a result of lower headcount and a decrease of 1.1 million in freight out for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as 1.3 million of executives transition costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income (expense), net changed by 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 1.5 million increase in other income and a 0.1 million increase in other expense. The increase in other income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to higher interest income received due to higher cash and cash equivalents balances.

 Research and Development . Research and development expenses decreased by 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease of 11.8 million in employee-related expenses as a result of lower headcount, partially offset by an increase of 2.1 million due to the timing of capitalized software projects, an increase of 1.6 million in cloud hosting services expenses, and an increase of 1.3 million in consulting expenses. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative . Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 55.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 28.9 million in employee-related expenses as a result of lower headcount, a decrease of 8.4 million in impairment and abandonment charges of operating lease right-of-use and other assets in connection with restructuring activities of certain leased facilities, a decrease of 4.7 million in restructuring costs, a decrease of 3.3 million in commissions expenses, a decrease of 2.6 million in freight out, and a decrease of 2.2 million in executives transition costs. 
 Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income (expense), net changed by 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a 5.1 million increase in other income and a 1.0 million increase in other expense. The increase in other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to higher interest income received due to higher interest rates and higher cash and cash equivalents balances.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change in 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes 5,304 4,405 899 20 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 5.3 million and 4.4 million, respectively, by applying our estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income and adjusted for 4.9 million and 5.6 million, respectively, of discrete income tax expense primarily from equity compensation. The change in the provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the provision for income taxes for the same period in 2023 was insignificant, consisting of various offsetting components of annual effective tax rate and discrete income tax expense.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 570.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 468.0 million at December 31, 2023. All of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in bank accounts and money market funds held in sweep and asset management accounts with financial institutions of high credit quality. 
 Our cash position and working capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents 570,628 467,972 Working capital (1) 
 49,745 559,779 _________________________________________________ 
 (1) The decrease in working capital as of September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the classification of our convertible senior notes as a current rather than long-term liability. Refer to Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1:1 and 2.5:1 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Sources of Cash 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On November 15, 2019, Omnicell, Inc. entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Prior A R Credit Agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citizens Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as joint lead arrangers, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Prior A R Credit Agreement provided for (a) a five-year revolving credit facility of 500.0 million (the Prior Revolving Credit Facility and (b) an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to 250.0 million (the Prior Incremental Facility ). In addition, the Prior A R Credit Agreement included a letter of credit sub-limit of up to 15.0 million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to 25.0 million. The Prior A R Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on September 22, 2020 and March 29, 2023 to permit the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the purchase of the convertible note hedge transactions (as described in Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), expand our flexibility to make restricted payments (including common stock repurchases), and replace the total net leverage covenant, as well as to remove and replace the interest rate benchmark based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR and related LIBOR-based mechanics with an interest rate benchmark based on the secured overnight financing rate SOFR as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and related SOFR-based mechanics. 
 On October 10, 2023, Omnicell, Inc. entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second A R Credit Agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Capital Markets LLC and TD Securities (USA) LLC as joint lead arrangers and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Second A R Credit Agreement supersedes the Prior A R Credit Agreement and provides for (a) a five-year revolving credit facility of 350.0 million (the Current Revolving Credit Facility and (b) an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to an amount equal to the sum of (i) the greater of 250.0 million and 100 of the adjusted consolidated EBITDA for the last four quarters and (ii) additional amounts subject to pro forma compliance with certain consolidated secured net leverage ratio (the Current Incremental Facility ). In addition, the Second A R Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of up to 15.0 million and a swing line loan sub-limit of up to 25.0 million. The Second A R Credit Agreement has an expiration date of October 10, 2028, subject to acceleration under certain conditions, upon which date all remaining outstanding borrowings will be due and payable. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 350.0 million of funds available under the Current Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance under the Current Revolving Credit Facility and we were in full compliance with all covenants. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreement , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. We expect to use future loans under the Current Revolving Credit Facility, if any, for working capital, potential acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. 
 Uses of Cash 
 Our future uses of cash are expected to be primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, and other contractual obligations. We also expect a continued use of cash for potential acquisitions and acquisition-related activities, as well as repurchases of our common stock. In addition, we may also use a portion of our cash as we consider various options related to our outstanding debt. 
 The 2016 Repurchase Program has a total of 2.7 million remaining for future repurchases as of September 30, 2024, which may result in additional use of cash. There were no stock repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Stock Repurchase Programs under Note 15, Employee Benefits and Share-Based Compensation , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Based on our current business plan and backlog, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations, cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP ), along with the availability of funds under the Current Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, outstanding debt, and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. For periods beyond the next twelve months, we also anticipate that our net operating cash flows plus existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will suffice to fund the growth of our business. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

 Operating Activities 
 We expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing of other liability payments. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 131.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of operating inflows of 93.8 million and favorable working capital movements of 37.6 million. Operating inflows consisted of a net loss of 3.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 97.1 million, which consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of 62.3 million, share-based compensation expense of 30.3 million, inventory write-down charges of 5.4 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of 5.3 million, and a change in deferred income taxes of 9.4 million. The favorable working capital was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenues of 27.7 million driven by an increase in billings, a decrease in inventories of 10.0 million resulting from inventory management initiatives, a decrease of 8.4 million in other current assets due to a decrease in income tax receivables, and an increase of 7.0 million in accrued liabilities due to an increase in rebate liabilities. These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease of 8.0 million in operating lease liabilities, an increase of 7.5 million in investment in sales-type leases resulting from growth in our Advanced Services offerings, and a decrease in accrued compensation of 6.7 million. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 142.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of operating inflows of 107.8 million and favorable working capital movements of 34.9 million. Operating inflows consisted of a net loss of 6.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 113.8 million, which consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of 65.6 million, share-based compensation expense of 43.1 million, impairment and abandonment of operating lease right-of-use assets related to facilities of 7.8 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of 6.2 million, and a change in deferred income taxes of 14.2 million. The favorable working capital was primarily due to a decrease in inventories of 31.7 million primarily due to management of inventory levels to align with the current forecasted demand, a decrease in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of 27.1 million primarily due to the timing of billings, shipments, and collections, as well as the impacts of lower revenues, an increase in deferred revenues of 23.6 million primarily due to an increase in billings for certain service and subscription offerings, and a decrease in prepaid commissions of 5.5 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation of 29.4 million primarily due to a decrease in the accrual for restructuring initiatives, lower commissions, as well as timing of payroll and ESPP purchases, a decrease in accounts payable of 13.4 million primarily due to an overall decrease in spending, as well as the timing of payments, an increase in investment in sales-type leases of 8.8 million primarily due to the acceptance of certain Advanced Services products under sales-type lease arrangements, and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 8.1 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 39.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of capital expenditures of 27.4 million for property and equipment and 11.8 million for external-use software development costs. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 42.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of capital expenditures of 32.4 million for property and equipment, and 10.2 million for external-use software development costs. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a net change in the customer funds balances of 10.7 million, partially offset by 13.1 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and ESPP purchases. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 23.0 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and ESPP purchases, partially offset by 6.1 million in employees taxes paid related to restricted stock unit vesting and a net change in the customer funds balances of 6.6 million. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the contractual obligations disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, set forth in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (1) Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leased office buildings, data centers, office equipment, and vehicles. Refer to Note 12, Lessee Leases , of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 (2) We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. These amounts are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because we believe that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. 
 (3) We issued convertible senior notes in September 2020 that are due in September 2025. The obligations presented above include both principal and interest for these notes. Although these notes mature in 2025, they may be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayment of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayment as indicated in the table above. Refer to Note 10, Convertible Senior Notes, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 (4) Refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We operate in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which are the British Pound and the Euro. In order to manage foreign currency risk, at times we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in spot exchange rates of mainly non-functional currency denominated assets or liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts. 
 Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk through our borrowing activities. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance under the current Second A R Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreement, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 The net carrying amount under our convertible senior notes was 572.0 million as of September 30, 2024. Although our convertible senior notes are based on a fixed rate, changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of such notes. As of September 30, 2024, the fair market value of our convertible senior notes was 548.8 million.

 We have used, and in the future we may use, interest rate swap agreements to protect against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing our exposure to variability in cash flows relating to interest payments on a portion of our outstanding debt. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements.
