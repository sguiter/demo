Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Contract Assets - Current Contract Assets - Non-current Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) - Current Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) - Non-current 
 Contract assets primarily result from revenue being recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the client, except where invoicing is contingent upon the completion of other performance obligations or payment terms differ from the provisioning of services. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from clients in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the client. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. 
 The Company analyzes contract language to identify if a significant financing component does exist and would adjust the transaction price for any material effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either party to the contract with a significant benefit of financing the transaction. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized revenue of and , respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods.

The Company expects to recognize approximately over the next months, in 13-24 months, and the balance thereafter. 
 Contract Costs 
 The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with clients that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and client conversion or implementation-related costs. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated. 
 Capitalized costs totaled and , at September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, amortization of deferred contract costs totaled and , respectively. There were no impairment losses in relation to capitalized costs for the periods presented.

The plan allows for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares or units, and performance shares or units. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan is . 
 Stock option awards 
 Under the 2015 EIP, terms and vesting periods of the options are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors when granted. The option period must expire not more than from the option grant date. The options granted under this plan are exercisable beginning after the grant date at an exercise price equal to 100 of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date. The options terminate upon surrender of the option, after termination of employment, upon the expiration of following notification of a deceased optionee, or after grant. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were options granted, forfeited, or exercised. At September 30, 2024, options were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of with an aggregate intrinsic value of .

 OVERVIEW 
 Jack Henry Associates, Inc. is a well-rounded financial technology company headquartered in Monett, Missouri, that employs approximately 7,170 full-time and part-time associates nationwide, and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily to community and regional financial institutions. Our solutions serve approximately 7,500 clients and consist of integrated data processing systems solutions to U.S. banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions with assets up to 50 billion, core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, and non-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter, and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry, to mitigate and control risks, optimize revenue and growth opportunities, and contain costs.

 new cross-sales opportunities. We provide compatible computer hardware for our on-premise installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced solutions in our private and public cloud. We perform data conversions, software implementations, initial and ongoing client training, and ongoing client support services. 
 We believe our primary competitive advantage is client service. Our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels that generate high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We consistently measure client satisfaction using a variety of surveys, such as an annual survey on the client's anniversary date and randomly-generated surveys initiated each day by routine support requests. Dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our client experience, including product implementation, education, and consulting services. 
 Our two primary revenue streams are services and support and processing. Services and support includes: private and public cloud revenues that predominantly have contract terms of six years at inception; product delivery and services revenues, which include revenues from the sales of licenses, implementation services, deconversions, consulting, and hardware; and on-premise support revenues, composed of maintenance fees that primarily contain annual contract terms. Processing includes: "remittance revenues from payment processing, remote capture, and ACH transactions; card revenues, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and transaction and digital revenues, which include transaction and mobile processing revenues. We continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins. 
 We have four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The respective segments include all related revenues along with the related cost of revenue. 
 A detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows. All amounts in the following discussion are in thousands, except per share amounts. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue increased 5.2 , or 29,614, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2024. Total revenue less deconversion revenue of 3,697 for the current fiscal quarter and less deconversion revenues of 4,136 for the prior fiscal year first quarter results in an increase of 5.3 , quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by growth in data processing and hosting, card, and Jack Henry digital revenues, including Banno. 
 Operating expenses increased 2.5 , or 11,038, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Total operating expenses less deconversion operating expenses of 202 for the current fiscal quarter and less deconversion operating expenses of 381 and non-recurring expenses of 16,443 for the prior fiscal year first quarter results in an increase of 6.6 . This increase was primarily driven by higher personnel and direct costs, increased internal licenses and fees, and higher amortization. 
 Operating income increased 14.0 , or 18,576, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Removing from total operating income the effects of deconversion operating income of 3,495 for the current fiscal quarter and deconversion operating income of 3,755 and non-recurring expenses of 16,443 for the prior fiscal year first quarter results in an increase of 1.6 , quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth partially offset by increased operating expenses detailed above. 
 The provision for income taxes increased 19.1 , or 6,038, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by the increase in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for the current fiscal first quarter was 24.0 compared to 23.7 for the same quarter a year ago. 
 Net income increased 17.2 , or 17,512, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Removing from total net income the effects of deconversion net income of 2,656 for the current fiscal year first quarter and deconversion net income of 2,854 and the VEDIP program net loss of 12,497 for the prior fiscal year first quarter, results in a 4.7 increase quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily due to net organic growth in our lines of revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 partially offset by higher operating expenses and the increased provision for income taxes compared to the same quarter last fiscal year.

 As we move into the second quarter of fiscal 2025, significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our sales pipeline is also encouraging. Our clients continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address, and in these times they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability, efficiency, and security. We believe our strong balance sheet, access to extensive lines of credit, the strength of our existing product line, and an unwavering commitment to superior client service position us well to address current and future opportunities. 
 A detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, follows. 
 Discussions compare the current fiscal year's three months ended September 30, 2024, to the prior fiscal year's three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 REVENUE 
 Services and Support Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Services and Support 356,679 342,205 4.2 Percentage of total revenue 59 60 
 Services and support revenue increased 4.2 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same quarter a year ago. Reducing services and support revenue for deconversion revenue from each quarter, which was 3,697 for the current fiscal year quarter and 4,136 for the prior fiscal year quarter, results in growth of 4.4 quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by double-digit growth in data processing and hosting revenues as new and existing clients migrate to our private cloud and processing volumes expand. 
 Processing Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Processing 244,303 229,163 6.6 Percentage of total revenue 41 40 
 Processing revenue increased 6.6 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by growth in card revenue primarily from monthly service and risk management fees, improvement in Jack Henry digital revenue (including Banno) from a higher number of active users and expanding volumes from existing products and the recent introduction of new add-on products, and higher payment processing revenues from expanding volumes and new client revenue. Deconversion revenue did not significantly affect processing revenue quarter over quarter. 
 
 OPERATING EXPENSES 
 Cost of Revenue Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Cost of Revenue 343,432 323,002 6.3 Percentage of total revenue 57 57 
 Cost of revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 6.3 over the prior fiscal year first quarter. Reducing cost of revenue for deconversion costs from each quarter, which were 115 for the current fiscal year quarter and 270 for the prior fiscal year quarter, results in a 6.4 increase quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher direct costs generally consistent with increases in the related lines of revenue, higher personnel costs, including an increase in employee headcount in the trailing twelve months, and increased internal licenses and fees from increased deployments and pricing. Cost of revenue remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue compared to the prior fiscal year quarter.

Reducing selling, general, and administrative expense for deconversion costs from each quarter, which were 87 for the current fiscal year quarter and 111 for the prior fiscal year quarter and for VEDIP program expenses of 16,443 in the prior fiscal year quarter, results in a 6.9 increase quarter over quarter.

 Interest income increased due to changes in average outstanding balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense decreased when compared to the prior fiscal year quarter primarily due to a decrease in the amount outstanding.

 REPORTABLE SEGMENT DISCUSSION 
 The Company is a well-rounded financial technology company and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily to community and regional financial institutions. 
 The Company s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized customer/member information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, ACH origination and remote deposit capture processing, and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software, hosted processing platforms, and services, including digital/mobile banking, treasury services, online account opening, fraud/anti-money laundering ("AML") and lending/deposit solutions that can be integrated with the Company's Core solutions, and many can be used independently. The Corporate and Other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments, as well as operating expenses not directly attributable to the other three segments. 
 
 The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors, including performance against trend, budget, and forecast. Only revenue and costs of revenue are considered in the evaluation for each segment. 
 Immaterial adjustments have been made between segments to reclassify cost of revenue that was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These reclasses were made to be consistent with the current allocation of cost of revenue by segment. Cost of revenue reclassed for the three months ended September 30, 2023, from Complementary to Corporate and Other, was 1,318. 
 Core Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenue 195,624 186,439 4.9 Cost of Revenue 81,420 75,927 7.2 
 Revenue in the Core segment increased 4.9 and cost of revenue increased 7.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Reducing Core revenue for deconversion revenue in both quarters, which totaled 1,287 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 1,665 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, results in a 5.2 increase quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by growth in data processing and hosting revenues as new and existing clients migrate to our private cloud and processing volumes expand. Reducing Core cost of revenue for deconversion costs in both quarters, which totaled 37 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 103 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, results in a 7.3 increase quarter over quarter. The Core cost of revenue increase was primarily due to higher direct costs generally consistent with increases in related lines of revenue. Core cost of revenue increased 1 as a percentage of Core revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2024.

 Revenue in the Payments segment increased 6.3 and cost of revenue increased 3.9 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the equivalent quarter of the prior fiscal year. Reducing Payments revenue for deconversion revenue in both quarters, which totaled 1,914 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 1,006 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, results in a 5.9 increase quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher card revenue from organic growth from higher volumes, higher payment processing revenues from higher volumes and new client revenue, and increased remote capture and ACH revenue. The Payments cost of revenue increase was primarily due to higher direct costs generally consistent with increases in lines of revenue. Deconversion and non-recurring costs did not significantly affect Payments cost of revenue quarter over quarter. Payments cost of revenue as a percentage of Payments revenue decreased 1 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2024. 
 Complementary Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenue 171,702 161,366 6.4 Cost of Revenue 65,967 60,957 8.2 
 Revenue in the Complementary segment increased 6.4 and cost of revenue increased 8.2 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the equivalent quarter of the prior fiscal year. Reducing Complementary revenue for deconversion revenue in both quarters, which totaled 473 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 1,451 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, results in a 7.1 increase quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily driven by growth in hosting revenues as new and existing clients continued to migrate to our private cloud and processing volumes expanded and increased Jack Henry digital revenue as the number of active users increased and volumes expanded from existing and new add-on products. Reducing Complementary cost of revenue for deconversion costs in both quarters, which totaled 60 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 119 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, results in an 8.3 increase quarter over quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software from capital software development projects and increased licenses and fees from increased deployments and prices in the current quarter. Complementary cost of revenue as a percentage of Complementary revenue increased 1 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2024. 
 Corporate and Other Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenue 21,733 24,205 (10.2) Cost of Revenue 83,025 77,292 7.4 
 Revenue classified in the Corporate and Other segment includes revenues from other products and services and hardware not specifically attributed to the other three segments. Revenue in the Corporate and Other segment decreased 10.2 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the equivalent quarter of the prior fiscal year. Reducing Corporate and Other revenue for deconversion revenue in both quarters, which totaled 23 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 14 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, results in a 10.3 decrease quarter over quarter. The Corporate and Other revenue decrease was primarily due to lower hardware revenue quarter over quarter. 
 Cost of revenue for the Corporate and Other segment includes operating expenses not directly attributable to the other three segments. The cost of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 7.4 when compared to the prior fiscal year quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs, including an increase in headcount in the trailing twelve months, higher internal licenses and fees from increased deployments and prices, and increased cloud consumption costs, quarter over quarter. Deconversion and non-recurring costs did not significantly affect Corporate and Other cost of revenue quarter over quarter.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Dollar amounts in this item are in thousands. 
 Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to clients and interest risk on outstanding debt. We do not currently use any derivative financial instruments. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of controlled procedures involving senior management. 
 Based on the controls in place and the credit worthiness of the client base, we believe the credit risk associated with the extension of credit to our clients will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 We had 140,000 outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of September 30, 2024, and a 1 increase in our borrowing rate would increase our annual interest expense by 1,400.
