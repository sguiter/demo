 million and , respectively. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been designated as a hedge as well as the type of hedge. The Company has not designated its derivatives as hedges under U.S. GAAP. The Company did not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Periodically, the Company enters into forward sales contracts for the delivery of LNG to its customers. Certain of these sales contracts contain provisions that may meet the criteria of a derivative in the event delivery is not made. These contracts are accounted for under the normal purchase normal sales exclusion under U.S. GAAP and are not measured at fair value each reporting period. See Note 3 for a further discussion of our derivatives.

 Total revenues 

Variable and other Revenue Components 
 
 Certain of our contracts may include rental or service components at stated rates within the contract that vary depending on customer demand and are satisfied as the work is authorized by the customer and performed by the Company. Additionally, LNG product sales agreements may include both fixed and variable fees per gallon of LNG but are representative of the stand-alone selling price for LNG at the time the contract was negotiated. We have concluded that the variable LNG fees meet the exception for allocating variable consideration to specific parts of the contract. As such, the variable consideration for these contracts is allocated to each distinct gallon of LNG and recognized when that distinct gallon of LNG is delivered to the customer. 
 
 Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue-producing transactions between the Company and its customers, such as sales, use and value-added taxes, are excluded from revenue. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a two -year marine bunkering contract with a new customer which represents approximately and of the Company's revenue for the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. 

million MMBtu (million British thermal units) and million MMBtu of natural gas at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The Company purchased the Call Options to manage the risk of increasing natural gas prices above what it can charge its customers. The Company may also enter into other derivative transactions when beneficial. The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Call Options are predominantly determined from broker quotes and are considered a level 2 fair value measurement. The following table presents the location and fair value of the Call Options at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 

Right-of-use assets and other noncurrent assets (1),(2) 

1 Amounts are presented on a gross basis. 
 
 2 The classification between current and noncurrent assets is based upon when the Call Options mature. 

The Company has not designated the Call Options as a hedge under U.S. GAAP and all resulting gains and losses from changes in the fair value of its derivative instruments are included within change in unrealized loss or gain on natural gas derivatives within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The table below presents the changes in the fair value as well as the net realized gains and losses for all of its derivatives from the Call Options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

1 Accumulated statutory reserves in equity method investments of million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is included in our investment in BOMAY. In accordance with the People s Republic of China, PRC regulations on enterprises with foreign ownership, an enterprise established in the PRC with foreign ownership is required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely (i) General Reserve Fund, (ii) Enterprise Expansion Fund and (iii) Staff Welfare and Bonus Fund, which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. A non-wholly-owned foreign invested enterprise is permitted to provide for the above allocation at the discretion of its board of directors. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. 

2 The Company s initial investment in BOMAY differed from the Company s share of BOMAY s equity as a result of applying fair value accounting pursuant to ASC 805. The basis difference is being accreted over an original period of nine years (the expected life of the joint venture). The Company's accretion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 both totaled approximately thousand each, respectively, and is included in income from equity investment in foreign joint venture in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remaining basis difference, net of accumulated accretion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is summarized in the following table (in thousands): 

Less accumulated accretion 
 Net remaining basis difference at end of period 

In accordance with our long-lived asset policy, when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, management tests long-lived assets for impairment. If the estimated future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying amount, an impairment write-down (representing the carrying amount of the long-lived asset which exceeds the present value of estimated expected future cash flows) would be recorded as a period expense. In making this evaluation, a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors are considered including national and local economic, political and market conditions, industry trends and prospects, liquidity and capital resources and other pertinent factors. Based on this evaluation for this reporting period, the Company does not believe an impairment of our investment in BOMAY is necessary for the period ending September 30, 2024 .

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q this Report and the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 7, 2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows, including trends that might appear, are not necessarily indicative of future operations or cash flows. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Stabilis Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries is an energy transition company that provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation and fueling solutions, primarily using liquefied natural gas LNG ), to multiple end markets. We provide LNG solutions to customers in diverse end markets, including aerospace, agriculture, energy, industrial, marine bunkering, mining, pipeline, remote power and utility markets. LNG can be used to deliver natural gas to locations where pipeline service is unavailable, has been interrupted, or needs to be supplemented. LNG can also be used to replace a variety of alternative fuels, including distillate fuel oil and propane, among others, to provide environmental and economic benefits. Increasingly, LNG is being utilized as a transportation fuel in the marine industry and as a propellant in the private rocket launch sector. We believe that these fuel markets are large and provide significant opportunities for LNG usage. 
 
 The Company generates revenue by selling and delivering LNG to our customers, renting cryogenic equipment and providing engineering and field support services. We sell our products and services separately or as a bundle depending on the customer s needs. Pricing depends on market pricing for natural gas and competing fuel sources (such as diesel, fuel oil, and propane among others), as well as the customer s purchased volume, contract duration and credit profile. 
 
 LNG Production and Sales Stabilis builds and operates cryogenic natural gas processing facilities, called liquefiers, which convert natural gas into LNG through a purification and multiple stage cooling process. We currently own and operate a liquefier that can produce up to 100,000 LNG gallons per day in George West, Texas and a liquefier that can produce up to 30,000 LNG gallons per day in Port Allen, Louisiana. We also purchase LNG from third-party production sources which allows us to support customers in markets where we do not own liquefiers. We make the determination of LNG and transportation supply sources based on the cost of LNG, the transportation cost to deliver to regional customer locations, and the reliability of the supply source. Revenues earned from the production and sales of LNG are included within LNG Product revenue. 
 
 Transportation and Logistics Services Stabilis offers our customers a virtual natural gas pipeline by providing turnkey LNG transportation and logistics services in North America. We deliver LNG to our customers work sites from both our own production facilities and our network of third-party production sources located throughout North America. We own a fleet of cryogenic trailers to transport and deliver LNG. We also outsource similar equipment and transportation services from qualified third-party providers as required to support our customer base. Revenues earned from the transportation and logistical services of LNG to our customers are included within LNG Product revenue. 
 
 Cryogenic Equipment Rental Stabilis operates a fleet of mobile LNG storage and vaporization assets, including: transportation trailers, electric and gas-fired vaporizers, ambient vaporizers, storage tanks, and mobile vehicle fuelers. We also own several stationary storage and regasification assets. We believe this is one of the largest fleets of small-scale LNG equipment in North America. Our fleet consists primarily of trailer-mounted mobile assets, making delivery to and between customer locations more efficient. We deploy these assets on job sites to provide our customers with the equipment required to transport, store, and consume LNG in their operations. Revenues earned from cryogenic equipment rental are included within Rental revenue. 
 
 Engineering and Field Support Services Stabilis has experience in the safe, cost effective, and reliable use of LNG in multiple customer applications. We have also developed many processes and procedures that we believe improve our customers use of LNG in their operations. Our engineers help our customers design and integrate LNG into their operations and our field service technicians help our customers mobilize, commission and reliably operate on the job site. Revenues earned from engineering and field support services are included within Service revenue. 

U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") Approval to Export LNG 
 
 In the third quarter of 2022, Stabilis received authorization from the DOE to export domestically produced LNG to all free trade ("FTA") and non-free trade ("non-FTA") countries, for up to 51.75 billion cubic feet per year (or approximately 1.0 MTPA) of natural gas equivalent. The authorization is for shipments of LNG and is for a term of 28 years. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has met the initial time requirement to initiate exports to non-FTA countries. For exports to FTA countries, the Company has five years from the date it received the authorization with which to initiate exportation of LNG. 
 
 The DOE authorization received during the third quarter of 2022 supplements the Company's other existing export license from the DOE, which authorizes the Company to import and export LNG from and to Canada and Mexico, via truck. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we delivered LNG to Mexico and Belgium.

Table of Contents 

Change in unrealized gain/loss on natural gas derivatives. The Company recognized a gain of 0.3 million in the change in unrealized (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives for both the Current Year and the Prior Year. The gains in both periods were due to offsetting amortization of realized losses as call option volumes expired. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 0.4 million in the Current Year compared to the Prior Year primarily due to increased compensation costs partially offset by decreased professional services costs. 
 
 Depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 0.7 million during the Current Year as compared to the Prior Year due to assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives. 
 
 Gain on disposal of assets. The Company recorded a gain on disposal of assets of 0.3 million in the Current Year related to the sale of certain assets in which proceeds of 0.3 million were received. In the Prior Year, a gain on the disposal of assets was recorded related to insurance proceeds received for assets damaged in a fire. 
 
 Net equity income from foreign joint venture operations. Equity income from the Company's foreign joint venture decreased by 0.3 million in Current Year compared to the Prior Year due to decreased net profits by the joint venture. 
 
 Interest (expense) income. Interest income, net was 0.1 million for the Current Year compared to interest expense of 0.2 million in the Prior Year. The decrease in interest expense, net compared to the Prior Year is due to capitalized interest on capital projects and interest income earned on the Company's cash balances during the Current Year. 
 
 Interest expense, net - related parties. There was no related party interest expense in the Current Year, as the related party debt financing was paid in full at the end of fiscal year 2023, as compared to related party interest expense of 0.1 million in the Prior Year. 
 
 Other income (expense). Other income was 15 thousand during the Current Year compared to expense of 0.1 million in the Prior Year related to transactional foreign exchange gains (losses). 
 
 Income tax expense . The Company incurred a state and foreign income tax expense of 0.4 million during the Current Year compared to 0.2 million during the Prior Year due to improved operating results. No U.S. federal income taxes were recorded for the Current Year or Prior Year as any net U.S. deferred tax assets generated from operating losses or used from operating income were offset by a change in the Company's valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by our operations, cash on hand, proceeds received from borrowings under debt agreements and distributions received from our BOMAY joint venture. During the Current Year, our principal sources of liquidity were cash provided from our operations, our existing cash balances and distributions received from our BOMAY joint venture. The Company used cash flows generated from operations to invest in fixed assets to support growth, as well as to pay interest and principal outstanding under its debt agreements. 
 
 The Company has a three-year Revolving Credit Facility with Cadence Bank which provides for a maximum aggregate amount of 10.0 million, subject to a borrowing base of 80 of eligible accounts receivable. The Company may request an increase in the maximum aggregate amount under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to 5.0 million, subject to the approval of Cadence Bank. All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by the Borrowers accounts receivable and deposit accounts. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility incur interest at the Prime Rate published by the Wall Street Journal. Any unused portion is subject to a quarterly unused commitment fee of 0.5 per annum. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts have been drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 9, 2026. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various restrictions and covenants. The Company also has 1.0 million in remaining availability under its Secured Term Note with Ameristate Bank. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all its covenants related to its debt. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 12.4 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand and 9.8 million in outstanding debt (net of debt issuance costs), and lease obligations (of which 2.4 million is due in the next twelve months). The Company has total availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Ameristate Secured Term Loan Facility of 3.2 million at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made no draws on either the Revolving Credit Facility or the Ameristate Secured Term Loan Facility. The Company has also filed a shelf registration statement (described below) which provides the Company the flexibility to raise capital to fund working capital requirements, repay debt and/or fund future transactions. 
 
 The Company is subject to substantial business risks and uncertainties inherent in the LNG industry and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to sustain itself or to support future growth. Management believes the business will generate sufficient cash flows from its operations along with availability under the Company's debt agreements to fund the business for the next twelve months. As we continue to grow, management continues to evaluate additional financing alternatives, however, there is no guarantee that additional debt or equity financing or other opportunities to raise capital will be available or available at terms that would be beneficial to shareholders.

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities of 6.1 million as compared to the Prior Year was primarily attributable to higher net income, changes in working capital and higher distributions received from the Company's equity investment in BOMAY. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities totaled 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in the Current Year of 5.8 million was primarily due to cash paid to purchase additional liquefaction assets to support growth in the Prior Year and proceeds received from the sale of assets in the Current Year. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in the Current Year compared to the Prior Year is due to lower debt payments as a result of having fully repaid related party debt as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Future Cash Requirements 
 
 We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including costs associated with fuel sales, debt repayments, purchases of equipment and other capital expenditures, maintenance of LNG production facilities, mergers and acquisitions (if any), pursuing market expansion, supporting sales and marketing activities and other general corporate purposes. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and repay our debt, we may elect to pursue additional financing activities such as refinancing existing debt, obtaining new debt, or debt or equity offerings to provide flexibility with our cash management. Certain of these alternatives may require the consent of current lenders or stockholders, and there is no assurance that we will be able to execute any of these alternatives on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, the Company may pursue expansion activities to increase liquefaction capabilities. In the event the Company pursues expansion, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure additional liquidity. 
 
 Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.6 million and primarily related to the purchase of additional liquefaction assets, refurbishments and upgrades to existing assets and rolling stock. Future capital expenditures over the next twelve months will be dependent upon business needs as well as the availability of additional capital at favorable terms which is difficult to predict. At September 30, 2024, the Company had purchase orders and payables open related to capital expenditures of approximately 6.0 million. 
 
 Shelf Registration Statement 
 
 On April 11, 2022, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (the Shelf Registration which was declared effective on April 26, 2022 and will permit the Company to issue up to 100.0 million in either common stock, preferred stock, warrants or a combination of the above, and gives the Company the flexibility to raise capital to fund working capital requirements, repay debt and/or fund future transactions. On December 16, 2022, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the Shelf Registration that allows the Company to sell and issue shares of common stock directly to the public at the market as permitted in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. As a smaller reporting company, we are subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, which limits the amounts that we may sell under the Shelf Registration to no more than one-third of our public float in any twelve month period as measured in accordance with such instruction. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise capital pursuant to the Shelf Registration on acceptable terms or at all.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had no transactions that met the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial position, operating results, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. There have been no significant changes in the Company's Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from those disclosed within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024.
