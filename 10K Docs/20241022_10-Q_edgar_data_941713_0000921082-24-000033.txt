EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 We refer to Highwoods Properties, Inc. as the Company, Highwoods Realty Limited Partnership as the Operating Partnership, the Company s common stock as Common Stock or Common Shares, the Company s preferred stock as Preferred Stock or Preferred Shares, the Operating Partnership s common partnership interests as Common Units and the Operating Partnership s preferred partnership interests as Preferred Units. References to we and our mean the Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 
 The Company conducts its activities through the Operating Partnership and is its sole general partner. The partnership agreement provides that the Operating Partnership will assume and pay when due, or reimburse the Company for payment of, all costs and expenses relating to the ownership and operations of, or for the benefit of, the Operating Partnership. The partnership agreement further provides that all expenses of the Company are deemed to be incurred for the benefit of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 Except as otherwise noted, all property-level operational information presented herein includes in-service wholly owned properties and in-service properties owned by consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures (at our share). Development projects are not considered in-service properties until such projects are completed and stabilized. Stabilization occurs at the beginning of the first quarter after the earlier of: (1) the projected stabilization date; or (2) the date on which a project's occupancy generally exceeds 93 . 
 
 Certain information contained herein is presented as of October 15, 2024, the latest practicable date for financial information prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of the Company and the Operating Partnership. We believe combining the quarterly reports into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 
 combined reports better reflect how management and investors view the business as a single operating unit; 
 
 combined reports enhance investors understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 
 
 combined reports are more efficient for the Company and the Operating Partnership and result in savings in time, effort and expense; and 
 
 combined reports are more efficient for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure and providing a single document for their review. 
 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 
 Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 
 Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements - Earnings Per Share and Per Unit; 
 
 Item 4 - Controls and Procedures; and 
 
 Item 6 - Certifications of CEO and CFO Pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 joint ventures with Granite Properties Granite to develop Granite Park Six and 23Springs. We own a interest in each of these two joint ventures. 
 
 We determined that we have a variable interest in both the Granite Park Six and 23Springs joint ventures primarily because the entities were designed to pass along interest rate risk, equity price risk and operation risk to us and Granite as equity holders. The joint ventures were further determined to be variable interest entities as they require additional subordinated financial support in the form of loans because the initial equity investments provided by us and Granite were not sufficient to finance the planned investments and operations. We concluded that we do not have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of either entity and therefore do not qualify as the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the entities are not consolidated. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Granite Park Six joint venture paid down the outstanding million balance with respect to a million construction loan obtained in 2022. The loan, which matures in January 2026, has an interest rate of plus basis points. In connection with this loan paydown, we and Granite each contributed million to the joint venture. This reconsideration event did not change our initial conclusion that the Granite Park Six joint venture is a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary. As such, the entity remains unconsolidated. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our risk of loss with respect to these arrangements was limited to the carrying value of each investment balance. Our investment balances were million and million as of September 30, 2024 for the Granite Park Six and 23Springs joint ventures, respectively. The assets of the Granite Park Six and 23Springs joint ventures can be used only to settle obligations of the respective joint venture, and their creditors have no recourse to our wholly owned assets. 
 
 - M+O JV, LLC McKinney Olive joint venture 
 
 During 2022, we expanded our Dallas market presence by acquiring McKinney Olive through the formation of another joint venture with Granite in which we own a interest. 
 
 We determined that we have a variable interest in the McKinney Olive joint venture primarily because the entity was designed to pass along interest rate risk, equity price risk and operation risk to us and Granite as equity holders. The McKinney Olive joint venture was further determined to be a variable interest entity as it requires additional subordinated financial support in the form of a loan because the initial equity investments by us and Granite, including the additional preferred equity provided by us that was subsequently redeemed in full during 2023, were not sufficient to finance its planned investments and operations. We concluded that we do not have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the entity and therefore do not qualify as the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the entity is not consolidated. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the McKinney Olive joint venture paid off at maturity the remaining million balance on a secured mortgage loan with a stated interest rate of and an effective interest rate of . In connection with this loan payoff, we and Granite each contributed million to the joint venture. This reconsideration event did not change our initial conclusion that the McKinney Olive joint venture is a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary. As such, the entity remains unconsolidated.

 During 2021, we formed the 2827 Peachtree joint venture in Atlanta with Brand Properties, LLC Brand ). We own a interest in this joint venture. 
 
 We determined that we have a variable interest in the 2827 Peachtree joint venture primarily because the entity was designed to pass along interest rate risk, equity price risk and operation risk to us as both a debt and equity holder and to Brand as an equity holder. The 2827 Peachtree joint venture was further determined to be a variable interest entity as it requires additional subordinated financial support in the form of a loan because the initial equity investments provided by us and Brand were not sufficient to finance its planned investments and operations. We concluded that we do not have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the entity and therefore do not qualify as the primary beneficiary.

 - HRLP MTW, LLC Midtown West joint venture 
 
 In 2019, we formed the Midtown West joint venture in Tampa with Bromley. We own an interest in this joint venture. 
 
 We determined that we have a variable interest in the Midtown West joint venture primarily because the entity was designed to pass along interest rate risk, equity price risk and operation risk to us and Bromley as equity holders. The Midtown West joint venture was further determined to be a variable interest entity as it requires additional subordinated financial support in the form of a loan because the initial equity investments provided by us and Bromley were not sufficient to finance its planned investments and operations. We, as the majority owner and managing member and through our control rights as set forth in the joint venture s governance documents, were determined to be the primary beneficiary as we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity (primarily lease rates, property operations and capital expenditures) and significant economic exposure through our equity investment. As such, the Midtown West joint venture is consolidated and all intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated.

 As of September 30, 2024, our secured mortgage loans were collateralized by real estate assets with an undepreciated book value of million. 
 
 Our million unsecured revolving credit facility was modified during the first quarter of 2024 and is now scheduled to mature in January 2028 (but can be extended for additional periods at our option assuming no defaults have occurred). The interest rate on our revolving credit facility is plus a related spread adjustment of basis points and a borrowing spread of basis points, based on current credit ratings. The annual facility fee is basis points. The interest rate and facility fee are based on the higher of the publicly announced ratings from Moody s Investors Service or Standard Poor s Ratings Services. We incurred million of debt issuance costs during the first quarter of 2024, which will be amortized along with certain existing unamortized debt issuance costs over the remaining term of our new revolving credit facility, and recorded million of loss on debt extinguishment. During the second quarter of 2024, we modified the revolving credit facility to provide that the interest rate may be adjusted upward or downward by basis points depending upon whether or not we achieve certain pre-determined sustainability goals with respect to the ongoing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. There was million and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and October 15, 2024, respectively. As of both September 30, 2024 and October 15, 2024, we had million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability on our revolving credit facility. As a result, the unused capacity of our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and October 15, 2024 was million and million, respectively. 
 
 We are currently in compliance with financial covenants with respect to our consolidated debt. 
 
 We have considered our short-term liquidity needs within from October 22, 2024 (the date of issuance of the quarterly financial statements) and the adequacy of our estimated cash flows from operating activities and other available financing sources to meet these needs. Importantly, we have no scheduled debt maturities during such one-year period. We have concluded it is probable we will meet these short-term liquidity requirements through a combination of the following: 
 
 available cash and cash equivalents; 
 
 cash flows from operating activities; 
 
 issuance of debt securities by the Operating Partnership; 
 
 issuance of secured debt; 
 
 bank term loans; 
 
 borrowings under our revolving credit facility; 
 
 issuance of equity securities by the Company or the Operating Partnership; and 
 
 the disposition of non-core assets.

 Executive Summary 
 
 We are in the work-placemaking business. We believe that by creating environments and experiences where the best and brightest can achieve together what they cannot apart, we can deliver greater value to our customers, their teammates and, in turn, our stakeholders. Our simple strategy is to own and operate high-quality workplaces in the BBDs within our footprint, maintain a strong balance sheet to be opportunistic throughout economic cycles, employ a talented and dedicated team and communicate transparently with all stakeholders. We focus on owning and managing buildings in the most dynamic and vibrant BBDs. BBDs are highly-energized and amenitized workplace locations that enhance our customers ability to attract and retain talent. They are both urban and suburban. Providing the most talent-supportive workplace options in these environments is core to our work-placemaking strategy. 
 
 Our investment strategy is to generate attractive and sustainable returns over the long term for our stockholders by developing, acquiring and owning a portfolio of high-quality, differentiated office buildings in the BBDs of our core markets. A core component of this strategy is to continuously strengthen the financial and operational performance, resiliency and long-term growth prospects of our existing in-service portfolio and recycle those properties that no longer meet our criteria. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Our operating results depend heavily on successfully leasing and operating the office space in our portfolio. Economic growth and office employment levels in our core markets are important factors, among others, in predicting our future operating results. The key components affecting our rental and other revenues are average occupancy, rental rates, cost recovery income, new developments placed in service, acquisitions and dispositions. Average occupancy generally increases during times of improving economic growth, as our ability to lease space outpaces vacancies that occur upon the expirations of existing leases. Average occupancy generally declines during times of slower or negative economic growth, when new vacancies tend to outpace our ability to lease space. Asset acquisitions, dispositions and new developments placed in service directly impact our rental revenues and could impact our average occupancy, depending upon the occupancy rate of the properties that are acquired, sold or placed in service. Another indicator of the predictability of future revenues is the expected lease expirations of our portfolio. As a result, in addition to seeking to increase our average occupancy by leasing current vacant space, we also concentrate our leasing efforts on renewing existing leases prior to expiration. For more information regarding our lease expirations, see Item 2. Properties - Lease Expirations and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to our Operations. The continued social acceptance, desirability and perceived economic benefits of work-from-home arrangements could materially and negatively impact the future demand for office space over the long-term in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Occupancy in our office portfolio decreased from 88.9 as of December 31, 2023 to 88.0 as of September 30, 2024. We expect average occupancy in our office portfolio to range from 86.0 to 87.0 for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Whether or not our rental revenue tracks average occupancy proportionally depends upon whether GAAP rents under signed new and renewal leases are higher or lower than the GAAP rents under expiring leases. Annualized rental revenues from second generation leases expiring during any particular year are typically less than 15 of our total annual rental revenues. The following table sets forth information regarding second generation office leases signed during the third quarter of 2024 (we define second generation office leases as leases with new customers and renewals of existing customers in both consolidated and unconsolidated office space that has been previously occupied and leases with respect to vacant space in acquired buildings):

 We strive to maintain a diverse, stable and creditworthy customer base. We have an internal guideline whereby customers that account for more than 3 of our revenues are periodically reviewed with the Company s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2024, only Bank of America (3.7 and Asurion (3.5 accounted for more than 3 of our annualized GAAP revenues. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Our expenses primarily consist of rental property expenses, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. From time to time, expenses also include impairments of real estate assets. Rental property expenses are expenses associated with our ownership and operation of rental properties and include expenses that vary somewhat proportionately to occupancy and usage levels, such as janitorial services and utilities, and expenses that do not vary based on occupancy, such as property taxes and insurance. Depreciation and amortization is a non-cash expense associated with the ownership of real property and generally remains relatively consistent each year, unless we buy, develop or sell assets, since our properties and related building and tenant improvement assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over fixed lives. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of management and employee salaries and benefits, corporate overhead and short and long-term incentive compensation. 
 
 Net Operating Income 
 
 Whether or not we record increasing net operating income NOI in our same property portfolio typically depends upon our ability to garner higher rental revenues, whether from higher average occupancy, higher GAAP rents per rentable square foot or higher cost recovery income, that exceed any corresponding growth in operating expenses. Consolidated same property NOI was 0.4 million, or 0.3 , higher in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 due to a decrease of 0.6 million in same property expenses offset by a decrease of 0.2 million in same property revenue. 
 
 In addition to the effect of consolidated same property NOI, whether or not NOI increases typically depends upon whether the NOI from our acquired properties and recently completed development projects exceeds the NOI from property dispositions. NOI was 1.3 million, or 0.9 , lower in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to lost NOI from property dispositions, partially offset by NOI from recently completed development projects and higher consolidated same property NOI. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 In calculating net cash related to operating activities, depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash expenses, are added back to net income. We have historically generated a positive amount of cash from operating activities. From period to period, cash flow from operations primarily depends upon changes in our net income, as discussed more fully below under Results of Operations, changes in receivables and payables and net additions or decreases in our overall portfolio. 
 
 Net cash related to investing activities generally relates to capitalized costs incurred for leasing and major building improvements and our acquisition, development, disposition and joint venture activity. During periods of significant net acquisition and/or development activity, our cash used in such investing activities will generally exceed cash provided by investing activities, which typically consists of cash received upon the sale of properties and distributions from our joint ventures. 
 
 Net cash related to financing activities generally relates to distributions, incurrence and repayment of debt, and issuances, repurchases or redemptions of Common Stock, Common Units and Preferred Stock. We use a significant amount of our cash to fund distributions. Whether or not we have increases in the outstanding balances of debt during a period depends generally upon the net effect of our acquisition, disposition, development and joint venture activity. We generally use our revolving credit facility for daily working capital purposes, which means that during any given period, in order to minimize interest expense, we may record significant repayments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 For a discussion regarding dividends and distributions, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Dividends and Distributions. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We continue to maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet and believe we have ample liquidity to fund our operations and growth prospects. As of October 15, 2024, we had approximately 18 million of existing cash and 98.0 million drawn on our 750.0 million revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to mature in January 2028 (but which can be extended 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 for two additional six-month periods at our option). As of September 30, 2024, our leverage ratio, as measured by the ratio of our mortgages and notes payable and outstanding preferred stock to the undepreciated book value of our assets, was 42.3 , and there were 108.2 million diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding. 
 
 Rental and other revenues are our principal source of funds to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Other sources of funds for short-term liquidity needs include available working capital and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses, interest and principal amortization on our debt, distributions and capital expenditures, including building improvement costs, tenant improvement costs and lease commissions. Building improvements are capital costs to maintain or enhance existing buildings not typically related to a specific customer. Tenant improvements are the costs required to customize space for our customers specific needs. We anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities and planned financing activities, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, will be adequate to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. We use our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes, the short-term funding of our development and acquisition activity and, in certain instances, the repayment of other debt. The continued ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility allows us to quickly capitalize on strategic opportunities at short-term interest rates. 
 
 We generally believe existing cash and rental and other revenues will continue to be sufficient to fund our short-term liquidity needs such as funding operating and general and administrative expenses, paying interest expense, maintaining our existing quarterly dividend and funding existing portfolio capital expenditures, including building improvement costs, tenant improvement costs and lease commissions. 
 
 Our long-term liquidity uses generally consist of the retirement or refinancing of debt upon maturity, funding of building improvements, new building developments (including our proportionate share of joint venture developments) and land infrastructure projects and funding acquisitions of buildings and development land. Additionally, we may, from time to time, retire outstanding equity and/or debt securities through redemptions, open market repurchases, privately negotiated acquisitions or otherwise. 
 
 We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs through a combination of: 
 
 cash flows from operating activities; 
 
 issuance of debt securities by the Operating Partnership; 
 
 issuance of secured debt; 
 
 bank term loans; 
 
 borrowings under our revolving credit facility; 
 
 issuance of equity securities by the Company or the Operating Partnership; and 
 
 the disposition of non-core assets. 
 
 We have no debt scheduled to mature prior to 2026. We generally believe we will be able to satisfy future obligations with existing cash, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, new bank term loans, issuance of other unsecured debt, mortgage debt and/or proceeds from the sale of additional non-core assets. 
 
 Investment Activity 
 
 As noted above, a key tenet of our strategic plan is to continuously upgrade the quality of our office portfolio through acquisitions, dispositions and development. We generally seek to acquire and develop office buildings that improve the average quality of our overall portfolio and deliver consistent and sustainable value for our stockholders over the long-term. Whether or not an asset acquisition or new development results in higher per share net income or funds from operations FFO in any given period depends upon a number of factors, including whether the NOI for any such period exceeds the actual cost of capital used to finance the acquisition or development. Additionally, given the length of construction cycles, development projects are not placed in service until several years after commencement in some cases. Sales of non-core assets could result in lower per share net income or FFO in any given period in the event the return on the resulting use of proceeds does not exceed the capitalization rate on the sold properties.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Rental and Other Revenues 
 
 Rental and other revenues were 2.8 million, or 1.3 , lower in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to lost revenue from property dispositions and lower consolidated same property revenues, which decreased rental and other revenues by 3.5 million and 0.2 million, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by recently completed development projects, which increased rental and other revenues by 0.8 million. Same property rental and other revenues were lower primarily due to a decrease in occupancy, lower cost recoveries and higher credit losses, partially offset by higher average GAAP rents per rentable square foot and higher parking income. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Rental property and other expenses were 1.5 million, or 2.2 , lower in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to property dispositions and lower consolidated same property expenses, which decreased operating expenses by 1.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in operating expenses from recently completed development projects. Same property operating expenses were lower primarily due to lower taxes, partially offset by higher contract services, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 4.4 million, or 5.8 , higher in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to accelerated depreciation and amortization of tenant improvements and deferred leasing costs associated with the cancellation of a lease with a backfill customer for 110,000 square feet in the former Tivity building in Nashville that was originally scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2024. This increase was partially offset by property dispositions. 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 1.0 million, or 11.6 , higher in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher incentive compensation and gains on deferred compensation plan investments (which is fully offset by a corresponding increase in other income). 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense was 3.2 million, or 9.4 , higher in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher average interest rates, higher average debt balances and lower capitalized interest. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income was 1.1 million higher in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher interest income from seller financing and loans provided to the 2827 Peachtree and Midtown East joint ventures and gains on deferred compensation plan investments (which is fully offset by a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses). 
 
 Gains on Disposition of Property 
 
 Gains on disposition of property were 0.4 million higher in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was 0.7 million higher in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to lower interest expense from our McKinney and Olive joint venture due to the payoff of a mortgage loan in the third quarter of 2024 and higher income from our 2827 Peachtree joint venture, which was completed in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Earnings Per Common Share - Diluted 
 
 Diluted earnings per common share was 0.07 lower in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2023 due to a decrease in net income for the reasons discussed above.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Rental and Other Revenues 
 
 Rental and other revenues were 6.8 million, or 1.1 , lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to lost revenue from property dispositions, which decreased rental and other revenues by 10.7 million. This decrease was partially offset by higher consolidated same property revenues and recently completed development projects, which increased rental and other revenues by 2.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively. Same property rental and other revenues were higher primarily due to higher average GAAP rents per rentable square foot, higher cost recoveries and higher parking income, partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Rental property and other expenses were 1.5 million, or 0.7 , higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to 5.3 million of higher consolidated same property operating expenses, partially offset by a 3.5 million decrease in operating expenses from property dispositions. Same property operating expenses were higher primarily due to higher contract services, utilities, property insurance and repairs and maintenance, partially offset by lower taxes. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was 6.1 million, or 2.8 , higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to accelerated depreciation and amortization of tenant improvements and deferred leasing costs associated with the cancellation of a lease with a backfill customer for 110,000 square feet in the former Tivity building in Nashville that was originally scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2024, higher consolidated same property lease related depreciation and amortization and recently completed development projects, partially offset by property dispositions. 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 1.1 million, or 3.5 , higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher incentive compensation and gains on deferred compensation plan investments (which is fully offset by a corresponding increase in other income). 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense was 8.5 million, or 8.4 , higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 Other income was 7.5 million higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a refund of 5.8 million in the aggregate of Tennessee franchise taxes paid for the 2020 through 2023 tax years. During the second quarter of 2024, the State of Tennessee modified the methodology for calculating franchise taxes. The modification lowers our annual franchise tax obligation and was allowed to be applied retrospectively back to 2020. We also earned higher interest income from seller financing and loans provided to the 2827 Peachtree and Midtown East joint ventures and recognized gains on deferred compensation plan investments (which is fully offset by a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses). 
 
 Gains on Disposition of Property 
 
 Gains on disposition of property were 22.8 million higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 
 Gain on Deconsolidation of Affiliate 
 
 We recognized a gain on deconsolidation of 11.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to adjusting our retained interest in the Markel joint venture to fair value. We recorded no such gain on deconsolidation in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was 1.0 million higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher income from our 2827 Peachtree joint venture, which was completed in the third

 quarter of 2023, and lower interest expense from our McKinney and Olive joint venture due to the payoff of a mortgage loan in the third quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by expenses on Granite Park Six, which was completed in the third quarter of 2023 but is not yet stabilized. 
 
 Earnings Per Common Share - Diluted 
 
 Diluted earnings per common share was 0.05 lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 due to a decrease in net income for the reasons discussed above.

 Statements of Cash Flows 
 
 We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The following table sets forth the changes in the Company s cash flows (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 299,858 284,171 15,687 Net cash used in investing activities (204,963) (130,967) (73,996) Net cash used in financing activities (92,531) (152,213) 59,682 Total cash flows 2,364 991 1,373 
 
 The change in net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to net cash from the operations of consolidated same properties and recently completed development projects and changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by property dispositions and higher interest expense. 
 
 The change in net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to the redemption of our short-term preferred equity investment in the McKinney and Olive joint venture in 2023, contributions to the McKinney and Olive joint venture in 2024 to pay off a mortgage loan, contributions to the Granite Park Six joint venture in 2024 to pay down a construction loan and higher investments in tenant improvements and deferred leasing costs in 2024. These changes were partially offset by higher net proceeds from disposition activity and lower investments in building improvements and development in process. 
 
 The change in net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net debt borrowings. 
 
 Capitalization 
 
 The following table sets forth the Company s capitalization (in thousands, except per share amounts): 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Mortgages and notes payable, net, at recorded book value 3,295,521 3,213,206 Preferred Stock, at liquidation value 28,811 28,811 Common Stock outstanding 106,020 105,710 Common Units outstanding (not owned by the Company) 2,151 2,157 Per share stock price at period end 33.51 22.96 Market value of Common Stock and Common Units 3,624,810 2,476,626 Total capitalization 6,949,142 5,718,643 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our mortgages and notes payable and outstanding preferred stock represented 47.8 of our total capitalization and 42.3 of the undepreciated book value of our assets. See also Executive Summary - Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 
 Our mortgages and notes payable as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 714.4 million of secured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 4.43 and 2,596.4 million of unsecured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 4.55 . The secured indebtedness was collateralized by real estate assets with an undepreciated book value of 1,243.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, 455.0 million of our debt bears interest at floating rates.

 Investment Activity 
 
 In the normal course of business, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions. As a result, from time to time, we may have one or more potential acquisitions under consideration that are in varying stages of evaluation, negotiation or due diligence, including potential acquisitions that are subject to non-binding letters of intent or enforceable contracts. Consummation of any transaction is subject to a number of contingencies, including the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. No assurances can be provided that we will acquire any properties in the future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Capital Recycling Activity - Recent and future acquisitions and development properties may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations and may require renovation and development costs exceeding our estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we completed our exit from the Greensboro market by selling our last remaining land parcel for a sales price of 4.5 million and recorded a gain on disposition of property of 0.4 million. 
 
 We have a 50 interest in the McKinney Olive joint venture. During the third quarter of 2024, the McKinney Olive joint venture paid off at maturity the remaining 134.3 million balance on a secured mortgage loan with a stated interest rate of 4.5 and an effective interest rate of 5.3 . In connection with this loan payoff, we and Granite each contributed 62.1 million to the joint venture. 
 
 We have a 50 interest in the Granite Park Six joint venture. During the third quarter of 2024, the Granite Park Six joint venture paid down the outstanding 70.9 million balance with respect to a 115 million construction loan obtained in 2022. The loan, which matures in January 2026, has an interest rate of SOFR plus 394 basis points. In connection with this loan paydown, we and Granite each contributed 35.5 million to the joint venture. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were developing 0.8 million rentable square feet of office properties. The following table summarizes these announced and in-process office developments:

 Financing Activity 
 
 During 2023, we entered into separate equity distribution agreements with each of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., BTIG, LLC, Jefferies LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Regions Securities LLC, TD Securities (USA) LLC and Truist Securities, Inc. Under the terms of the equity distribution agreements, the Company may offer and sell up to 300.0 million in aggregate gross sales price of shares of Common Stock from time to time through such firms, acting as agents of the Company or as principals. Sales of the shares, if any, may be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices or as otherwise agreed with any of such firms (which may include block trades). During the third quarter of 2024, there were no shares of common stock issued under these agreements. 
 
 Our 750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility was modified during the first quarter of 2024 and is now scheduled to mature in January 2028 (but can be extended for two additional six-month periods at our option assuming no defaults have occurred). The interest rate on our revolving credit facility is SOFR plus a related spread adjustment of 10 basis points and a borrowing spread of 85 basis points, based on current credit ratings. The annual facility fee is 20 basis points. The interest rate and facility fee are based on the higher of the publicly announced ratings from Moody s Investors Service or Standard Poor s Ratings Services. We incurred 7.7 million of debt issuance costs during the first quarter of 2024, which will be amortized along with certain existing unamortized debt issuance costs over the remaining term of our new revolving credit facility, and 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 recorded 0.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment. During the second quarter of 2024, we modified the revolving credit facility to provide that the interest rate may be adjusted upward or downward by 2.5 basis points depending upon whether or not we achieve certain pre-determined sustainability goals with respect to the ongoing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. There was 105.0 million and 98.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and October 15, 2024, respectively. As of both September 30, 2024 and October 15, 2024, we had 0.1 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability on our revolving credit facility. As a result, the unused capacity of our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and October 15, 2024 was 644.9 million and 651.9 million, respectively. 
 
 We are currently in compliance with financial covenants and other requirements with respect to our consolidated debt. Although we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants and ratios for at least the next year, depending upon our future operating performance, property and financing transactions and general economic conditions, we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to be in compliance. 
 
 Our revolving credit facility and bank term loans require us to comply with customary operating covenants and various financial requirements. Upon an event of default on our revolving credit facility, the lenders having at least 51.0 of the total commitments under our revolving credit facility can accelerate all borrowings then outstanding, and we could be prohibited from borrowing any further amounts under our revolving credit facility, which would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our unsecured debt agreements contain cross-default provisions giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under more than 35.0 million with respect to other loans in some circumstances. 
 
 The indenture that governs the Operating Partnership s outstanding notes requires us to comply with customary operating covenants and various financial ratios. The trustee or the holders of at least 25.0 in principal amount of any series of notes can accelerate the principal amount of such series upon written notice of a default that remains uncured after 60 days. 
 
 We may not be able to repay, refinance or extend any or all of our debt at maturity or upon any acceleration. If any refinancing is done at higher interest rates, the increased interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to pay distributions. Any such refinancing could also impose tighter financial ratios and other covenants that restrict our ability to take actions that could otherwise be in our best interest, such as funding new development activity, making opportunistic acquisitions, repurchasing our securities or paying distributions. 
 
 Dividends and Distributions 
 
 To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must pay dividends to stockholders that are at least 90.0 of its annual REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. The partnership agreement requires the Operating Partnership to distribute at least enough cash for the Company to be able to pay such dividends. The Company s REIT taxable income, as determined by the federal tax laws, does not equal its net income under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). In addition, although capital gains are not required to be distributed to maintain REIT status, capital gains, if any, are subject to federal and state income tax unless such gains are distributed to stockholders. 
 
 Cash dividends and distributions reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available for other business purposes, including funding debt maturities, reducing debt or future growth initiatives. The amount of future distributions that will be made is at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors. For a discussion of the factors that will affect such cash flows and, accordingly, influence the decisions of the Company s Board of Directors regarding dividends and distributions, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Dividends and Distributions in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 On October 21, 2024, the Company declared a cash dividend of 0.50 per share of Common Stock, which is payable on December 10, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2024. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company declared and paid a cash dividend of 0.50 per share of Common Stock. 
 
 Current and Future Cash Needs 
 
 We anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and other available financing sources, including the issuance of debt securities by the Operating Partnership, the issuance of secured debt, bank term loans, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities by the Company or the Operating Partnership and the disposition of non-core assets, will be adequate to meet our short-term liquidity requirements . We generally believe existing cash and rental and other revenues will continue to be sufficient to fund operating and general and 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 administrative expenses, interest expense, our existing quarterly dividend and existing portfolio capital expenditures, including building improvement costs, tenant improvement costs and lease commissions. 
 
 We had 23.7 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. The unused capacity of our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and October 15, 2024 was 644.9 million and 651.9 million, respectively. 
 
 We have a currently effective automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC pursuant to which, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings on an as-needed basis, the Company may sell an indefinite amount of common stock, preferred stock and depositary shares and the Operating Partnership may sell an indefinite amount of debt securities, subject to our ability to effect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing market conditions. 
 
 From time to time, the Company enters into equity distribution agreements with a variety of firms pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of common stock through such firms, acting as agents of the Company or as principals. Sales of the shares, if any, may be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices or as otherwise agreed with any of such firms (which may include block trades). 
 
 During the remainder of 2024, we expect to sell up to 150 million of properties no longer considered to be core assets due to location, age, quality and/or overall strategic fit. We can make no assurance, however, that we will sell any additional non-core assets or, if we do, what the timing or terms of any such sale will be.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 There were no changes made by management to the critical accounting policies in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a description of our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Non-GAAP Information 
 
 The Company believes that FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share are metrics that are beneficial to management and investors and are important indicators of the performance of any equity REIT. Because these FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation, amortization and impairments of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. Management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes the use of FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of the Company s performance relative to its competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities. 
 
 FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share are non-GAAP financial measures and therefore do not represent net income or net income per share as defined by GAAP. Net income and net income per share as defined by GAAP are the most relevant measures in determining the Company s operating performance because these FFO measures include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, including adding back expenses such as depreciation, amortization and impairments. Furthermore, FFO available for common stockholders per share does not depict the amount that accrues directly to the stockholders benefit. Accordingly, FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share should never be considered as alternatives to net income, net income available for common stockholders, or net income available for common stockholders per share as indicators of the Company s operating performance. 
 
 The Company s presentation of FFO is consistent with FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is calculated as follows: 
 
 Net income/(loss) computed in accordance with GAAP; 
 
 Less net income, or plus net loss, attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated affiliates; 
 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 Plus depreciation and amortization of depreciable operating properties; 
 
 Less gains, or plus losses, from sales of depreciable operating properties, plus impairments on depreciable operating properties and excluding items that are classified as extraordinary items under GAAP; 
 
 Plus or minus our share of adjustments, including depreciation and amortization of depreciable operating properties, for unconsolidated joint venture investments (to reflect funds from operations on the same basis); and 
 
 Plus or minus adjustments for depreciation and amortization and gains/(losses) on sales of depreciable operating properties, plus impairments on depreciable operating properties, and noncontrolling interests in consolidated affiliates related to discontinued operations. 
 
 In calculating FFO, the Company includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership, which the Company believes is consistent with standard industry practice for REITs that operate through an UPREIT structure. The Company believes that it is important to present FFO on an as-converted basis since all of the Common Units not owned by the Company are redeemable on a one-for-one basis for shares of its Common Stock. 
 
 The following table sets forth the Company s FFO, FFO available for common stockholders and FFO available for common stockholders per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):

 108,161 107,832 108,089 107,762 
 __________ 
 (1) Includes assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive Common Stock equivalents. 
 
 In addition, the Company believes NOI and same property NOI are useful supplemental measures of the Company s property operating performance because such metrics provide a performance measure of the revenues and expenses directly involved in owning real estate assets and a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or FFO. The Company defines NOI as rental and other revenues less rental property and other expenses. The Company defines cash NOI as NOI less lease termination fees, straight-line rent, amortization of lease incentives and amortization of acquired above and below market leases. Other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate NOI, same property NOI and cash NOI. 
 
 In previous periods, our same property portfolio consisted only of wholly owned in-service properties. Beginning in 2024, we updated our same property portfolio to include our share of in-service joint venture properties. As of September 30, 2024, our same property portfolio consisted of 153 wholly owned and joint venture in-service properties encompassing 27.3 million rentable square feet that were owned during the entirety of the periods presented (from January 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024). As of December 31, 2023, our same property portfolio consisted of 154 wholly owned in-service properties encompassing 26.6 million rentable square feet that were owned during the entirety of the periods presented (from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023). The change in our same property portfolio was due to the addition of six joint venture properties encompassing 0.7 million rentable square feet, one property acquired during 2022 encompassing 0.4 million rentable square feet and one newly developed property placed in service during 2022 encompassing 0.1 million rentable square feet, offset by the removal of nine properties that were sold during 2024 encompassing 0.4 million rentable square feet.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 For information regarding our market risk as of December 31, 2023, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 SEC rules require us to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our annual and periodic reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company and the Operating Partnership were each effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 SEC rules also require us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. There were also no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Operating Partnership s internal control over financial reporting.
