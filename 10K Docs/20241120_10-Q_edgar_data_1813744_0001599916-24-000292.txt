Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate
their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization. 

ASC
820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an
entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances
(unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

-
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets
or liabilities. 

 -
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets
or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest
rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

 -
Level 3 Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

, a decrease of as compared to in
the prior year period ended April 30, 2023. The Company s decreased liquidity is due to decreased sales, particularly sales of crypto
miners. As
stated in the consolidated financial statements, the Company, for the period ended April 30, 2024, recorded a net loss of (-103 
y-o-y) and used (-160.78 y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. Additionally,
during the six months ended April 30, 2024, the Company increased working capital by (68 as compared to working capital
at October 31, 2023. 

Having reviewed the
above, the Company realizes that whether we shall be able to continue demonstrating the positive trends demonstrated in our financial
statements, lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's consolidated
financial statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities in the normal
course of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or perform our obligation(s)
in the future and procure any required funds needed to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business operations. 

Management has evaluated
the estimated impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one of which we believe
we will need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The Company assessed
the impact of COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales, which is currently
the Company s primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects it may have, socially
and economically, as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more specifically, our sales
results. At this time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation and considering the positive financial trends the Company has experienced year over year, e.g. the increase
in net income and increased working capital, management
believes that it has completely mitigated the circumstances that led to a doubt with respect to the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern, which existed at the time of the filing of the Company s prior year report. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of April 30, 2024 we had cash and cash balance in the amount of 231,669. Currently, our cash balance is sufficient to fund our operations
without the need for additional funding. 

Revenues 

We
recorded revenues of 1,967,597 for the six months ended April 30, 2024. We recorded revenues of 23,261,095 for the six months
ended April 30, 2023. 

Net
Income 

We
recorded net loss of 197,986 for the six months ended April 30, 2024. We recorded a net income of 7,148,756 for the six months ended
April 30, 2023. 

Cash
flow 

For
the six months ended April 30, 2024, we had negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of 10,616,853. The decrease in operating
cash flow is attributed to prepaid manufacturing services, purchases of inventory and decrease revenue during this this period. For the

Going
Concern 

The
Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern
that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The
Company demonstrates some positive trends, compared with the previous fiscal years, in our financial statements as in below: 

As
of April 30, 2024, the Company recorded cash and cash equivalents of 231,669, a decrease of 2,150,252 as compared to 2,381,921 in the
prior year period ended April 30, 2023. For the period ended, the Company s major sources of liquidity derived from crypto miner
sales and the sales of shares. As stated in the consolidated financial statements for the period ended April 30, 2024, the Company recorded
a net loss of 197,986 (-103 y-o-y) and used 10,616,853 (-160.78 y-o-y) in cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, the
Company s working capital has grown to approximately 11.1 million compared to October 31, 2023 working capital of approximately
 6.6 million, a 68 increase . 

Having
reviewed the above, the Company realizes that whether we shall be able to continue demonstrating the positive trends demonstrated in our
financial statements lies in our ability to continue to generate revenue and increase revenue going forward. Principally, the Company's
consolidated financial statements are based on going concern assumptions, which assume the realization of assets and offset of liabilities
in the normal course of business. Based on this, the Company also recognizes that it is critical for us to continue to operate and/or
perform our obligation(s) in the future and procure any required funds needed to meet the redemption of its debt during normal business
operations. 

Management
has evaluated the estimated impact of COVID-19, which has become a significant factor impacting operations of businesses globally, one
of which we believe we will need to continue to monitor as to the potential effects it may have on our own business. 

The
Company assessed the impact of COVID-19 and believes there to be minimal impact of COVID-19 on the Company s crypto miner sales,
which is currently the Company s primary source of revenue. The Company will need to continue to monitor COVID-19 and the effects
it may have, socially and economically, as it is possible that such developments may in fact impact our operations going forward or more
specifically, our sales results. At this time, the Company believes that it will not affect our assumptions as a going concern. 

Based
on the Company s evaluation and considering the positive financial trends it has experienced year over year, e.g. the increase in
net income and increase in working capital, management believes that it has completely mitigated the circumstances that led to a doubt
with respect to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, which existed at the time of the filing of the Company s
prior year report. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial
officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of April 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, with the participation of our chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers concluded
that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report due to material weaknesses
identified below. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls,
lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of an audit
committee. These material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, in
connection with the above evaluation. 

Inherent
limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal
control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for
advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization,
and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject
to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented
by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2024,
that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
