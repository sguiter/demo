Note 2 

Risks and Uncertainties In the normal course of its business, the Company primarily encounters two significant types of economic risk: credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Company s investments that results from a borrower s inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of investments due to changes in prepayment rates, interest rates, spreads or other market factors, including risks that impact the value of the collateral underlying the Company s investments. Taking into consideration these risks along with estimated prepayments, financings, collateral values, payment histories and other information, the Company believes that the carrying values of its investments are reasonable. Furthermore, for each of the periods presented, a significant portion of the Company s assets are dependent on its Servicer s abilities to perform their servicing obligations with respect to the residential mortgage loans underlying loans and securities.

 Effective June 30, 2024, all loans held at the Operating Partnership are designated as held-for-sale and accordingly no longer subject to ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (known as CECL ). Conversely, all loans held at Great Ajax REIT II continue to be held-for-investment and remain subject to CECL. Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and in connection with the change in the Company s strategy, the Company determined a legal entity approach was appropriate with the remaining loans held-for-investment based on the relatively homogeneous characteristics of the loans in each entity. Accordingly, the Company uses the following pools:

 The Company performs an analysis of its expectation of the amount of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected from its mortgage loan pools at the end of each calendar quarter. Loss estimates are determined based on the net present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows and the expected cash flows over the expected life of the loans. Contractual cash flows are calculated based on the stated terms of the loans. Projected cash flows are determined by factoring prepayment and expected losses based on delinquency status, the value of the underlying collateral, borrower age, weighted average coupon and length of a positive pay history. 
 
 Under CECL, the Company adjusts its allowance for expected credit losses when there are changes in its expectation of future cash flows as compared to the amounts expected to be contractually received. An increase to the allowance for expected credit losses will occur when there is a reduction in the Company s expected future cash flows as compared to its contractual amounts due. Reduction to the allowance, or recovery, may occur if there is an increase in expected future cash flows that were previously subject to an allowance for expected credit loss.

The Company previously accounted for the investment in Gaea using the equity method and reflected Gaea as an investment in affiliates but no longer has significant influence over the operations of Gaea. 
 
 The Company s investment in HTM securities represents the 5.01 the company is required to retain under the European risk retention rules for our secured borrowings (the EU Retained Interest ). Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Pursuant to the terms of these debt securities, the Company must hold at least 5.01 of the nominal value of each class of securities offered or sold to investors and the Company is prohibited from selling, transferring or otherwise surrendering all or part of the EU Retained Interest until all such classes are paid in full or redeemed. 
 
 Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are recorded at fair value and on the date of transfer. Any unrealized gains or losses continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded amortization of million and million, respectively, of unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss and of unamortized discount related to transfers of securities from AFS to HTM. Comparatively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded amortization of million and million, respectively, of unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss and of unamortized discount related to transfers of securities from AFS to HTM.

Overview 
 
 Great Ajax Corp. is a Maryland corporation that is organized and operated in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT. Historically, we have primarily targeted acquisitions of RPLs, which are residential mortgage loans on which at least five of the seven most recent payments have been made, or the most recent payment has been made and accepted pursuant to an agreement, or the full dollar amount, to cover at least five payments has been paid in the last seven months and (ii) NPLs, which are residential mortgage loans on which the most recent three payments have not been made. Historically, we acquired RPLs and NPLs either directly or in security form through joint ventures with institutional accredited investors. As discussed below, under RCM GA s management, we have started to shift our strategic direction towards investments in the commercial real estate sector and we have begun to invest in commercial mortgage loans. Our mortgage loans and real properties are serviced by Newrez, a Rithm affiliate. 
 
 On June 11, 2024, we completed our previously announced Strategic Transaction with Rithm. The Strategic Transaction included a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into by the Company, the Operating Partnership, the Former Manager and Rithm (the Securities Purchase Agreement on February 26, 2024, which provided for , upon the approval of the Company s stockholders on May 20, 2024, (i) the sale of 14.0 million of the Company s common stock to Rithm at a price of 4.87 per share (which represents the trailing five-day average closing price of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE as of the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, and (ii) a new management agreement (as maybe amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the Management Agreement with RCM GA, under which RCM GA would become the Company's new external manager. In connection with the Strategic Transaction, we terminated our existing management contract with the Former Manager primarily in exchange for approximately 3.2 million shares of our common stock. 
 
 For a full description of the components of the Strategic Transaction, see our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2024. 
 
 The Company conducts substantially all of its business through our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Great Ajax Operating LLC, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. GA-TRS LLC GA-TRS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that owns the equity interest in the Former Manager and previously owned an equity interest in the Former Servicer. GAJX Real Estate Corp. GAJX is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership formed to own, maintain, improve and sell REO properties acquired by the Company. The Company elected to treat GA-TRS and GAJX as a taxable REIT subsidiaries TRS under the Internal Revenue Code. Great Ajax Funding LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership formed to act as the depositor of mortgage loans into securitization trusts and to hold the subordinated securities issued by such trusts and any additional trusts the Company may form for additional secured borrowings. AJX Mortgage Trust I and AJX Mortgage Trust II are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership formed to hold mortgage loans used as collateral for financings under the Company s repurchase agreements. In addition, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, holds real estate owned REO properties acquired upon the foreclosure or other settlement of its owned NPLs. 
 
 42 

Our Operating Partnership, through interests in certain entities as of September 30, 2024, owns 99.9 of Great Ajax II REIT Inc. which owns Great Ajax II Depositor LLC which then acts as the depositor of mortgage loans into securitization trusts and holds subordinated securities issued by such trusts. Similarly, as of September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership wholly-owned Great Ajax III Depositor LLC, which was formed to act as the depositor for a single joint venture with our partners. We have securitized mortgage loans through these securitization trusts and retained subordinated securities from the secured borrowings. These trusts are considered to be variable interest entities VIEs ), and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. 
 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the code, and that our current intended manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 Strategic Transaction 
 
 We believe the Strategic Transaction will have a number of strategic benefits for our stockholders, including the opportunity to benefit from a shift in our strategic direction and the opportunity for our Company to benefit from Rithm s real estate, financial services and capital markets expertise, as well as Rithm s industry relationships. Under RCM GA s management, we seek to capitalize on commercial real estate investment opportunities. 
 
 Under RCM GA s management, we have started to shift our strategic direction towards investments in the commercial real estate sector, and we have begun to invest in CMBS. Our target assets are expected to include preferred equity or debt instruments secured by mortgages on commercial real estate, small balance commercial loans, mezzanine loans secured by pledges of equity interests in entities that own commercial real estate or other forms of subordinated debt in connection with commercial real estate, as well as commercial mortgage servicing rights and operating businesses in the commercial real estate sector. 
 
 We do not anticipate investing further in residential mortgage loans, RPLs or NPLs. Given the change in focus of our business, we intend to, over time, reposition much of our existing portfolio. We believe commercial real estate offers an attractive investment opportunity given market dynamics that are creating significant refinancing challenges and funding gaps.

Market Trends and Outlook 
 
 The US economy expanded at a solid rate during the third quarter of 2024, as real gross domestic product GDP rose an estimated annualized 2.8 following an average annualized increase of 2.3 in the first half of the year. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities was 2.19 on September 30, 2024, versus 2.29 on June 30, 2024, although this rate currently stands at 2.34 having risen from a low of 2.03 on September 10, 2024, the day before the release of August Consumer Price Index CPI data. The unemployment rate declined from July through September. The labor market appeared solid during the third quarter with low levels of unemployment claims, job growth that outpaced new labor market entrants and job openings that continued to exceed the number of unemployed job seekers. 
 
 Inflation. Although overall inflation rates have been reduced by declining oil prices, progress towards lower underlying inflation has stalled in recent months. The 12-month increase in the core CPI was 3.3 in September 2024, the same rate as in June 2024. Headline CPI price inflation in September 2024 stood at 2.4 , down from a 2024 high of 3.5 in March, as CPI energy prices declined 5.5 over the last six months. 
 
 Labor Markets. During the third quarter of 2024, job creation picked up with nonfarm payrolls averaging a gain of 186,000 jobs, versus an average of 147,000 jobs per month in the second quarter of 2024. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1 in September as compared to March (though this is down from 4.3 in April). The balance between the supply of and demand for labor continued to gradually improve with the ratio of job openings to unemployed job seekers at 1.18 in September 2024, versus 1.21 in June 2024. Year-over-year wage growth picked up to 4.0 in September 2024, from 3.8 in June 2024, indicating a still tight labor market. 
 
 Housing Market. Home sales remained at low levels in the third quarter of 2024, with total home sales (new and existing) in September reported at an annual rate of 4.58 million, little changed from 4.57 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024. For comparison, total home sales averaged 4.77 million in 2023 and 5.72 million in 2022. Home price growth also moderated further with the 12-month increase in the median resale price of an existing home at 3.0 in September 2024, which compares to 4.1 in June 2024. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Markets. Commercial real estate capitalization rates are stabilizing and CMBS spreads are tightening. As of the third quarter of 2024, year to date both are tighter by about ten basis points at 6.3 on capitalization rates. Spread tightening has helped issuance volumes, which are 29 higher in CMBS on a year-over-year basis through the third quarter of 2024. Refinancings are dominating in this cycle. Commercial Real Estate fundamentals, except for office, are holding up. Oversupplied commercial sectors, notably industrials and multi-family, witness to peak deliveries and significant declines in forward pipelines. The dislocations in the office sector will take years to work through and the quality of sponsor and location are key in value considerations. Meanwhile, consumer resilience is supporting performance of retail and lodging. In private label CMBS, modifications are dominating in this cycle, while foreclosures are rising although they remain below the global financial crisis cycle. 
 
 The economic conditions discussed above influence our investment strategy and results. The Federal Open Market Committee FOMC cut the federal funds rate target range by 50 basis points on September18, 2024, but has signaled that future interest rate adjustments are likely to be more gradual. Additionally, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.08 at the end of the third quarter as compared to 6.86 at the end of the second quarter. 
 
 The economic conditions discussed above influence our investment strategy and results. On markets, bond yields and mortgage rates declined modestly between the end of the second quarter and the end of the third quarter. The Fed Open Market Committee cut the fed funds rate target range by 50 basis points on September 18 but has signaled that future interest rate adjustments are likely to be more gradual. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.08 at the end of the third quarter compared to 6.86 at the end of the second quarter. 

Factors That May Affect Our Operating Results 
 
 Acquisitions . In light certain financial challenges, including the significant losses we have incurred to date and limited sources of financing, we do not expect to be able to acquire significant new commercial mortgage assets in the near future. 
 
 Financing . We previously securitized our whole loan portfolios, primarily as a financing tool, when economically efficient to create long-term, fixed rate, non-recourse financing with moderate leverage, while retaining one or more tranches of the subordinate MBS so created. The secured borrowings are structured as debt financings and not REMIC sales. We completed the securitization transactions pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), in which we issued notes primarily secured by seasoned, performing and non-performing mortgage loans primarily secured by 
 44 

first liens on one-to-four family residential properties. Currently there is substantial uncertainty in the securitization markets which has limited our access to financing. 
 
 Distributions . To qualify as a REIT under the code, we generally need to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income each year (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. This distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital to support our activities. 
 
 Expenses . Our expenses primarily consist of the fees and expenses payable by us under the Management Agreement and the Servicing Agreements. Additionally, our Former Manager incurred and our New Manager incurs direct, out-of-pocket costs and expenses related to managing our business, which are contractually reimbursable by us. Loan transaction expense is the cost of performing due diligence on pools of mortgage loans. Professional fees are primarily for legal, accounting and tax services. Real estate operating expense consists of the ownership and operating costs of our REO properties, and includes any charges for impairments to the carrying value of these assets, which may be significant. Interest expense, which is subtracted from our Interest income to arrive at Net interest income, consists of the costs to borrow money. 
 
 Changes in Market Interest Rates . The FOMC recently cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points which has had a favorable impact on the cost of funds of our repurchase lines of credit. Increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (1) the value of our mortgage loan and MBS portfolio to further decline; (2) coupons on our ARM and hybrid ARM mortgage loans and MBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (3) impact adversely our ability to securitize, re-securitize or sell our assets on attractive terms; (4) reduce the ability or desire of borrowers to refinance their loans; (5) mortgage related assets may become more illiquid during periods of interest rate volatility; (6) difficulties refinancing our securitizations and increases in the costs of our repurchase facility financings; (7) increase our financing costs as we seek to renew or replace borrowing facilities; and (8) to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (1) prepayments on our mortgage loan and MBS portfolio to increase, thereby accelerating the accretion of our purchase discounts; (2) the value of our mortgage loan and MBS portfolio to increase; (3) coupons on our ARM and hybrid ARM mortgage loans and MBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (4) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; and (e) to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of our hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, and other subjective assessments. In particular, we have identified six policies that, due to the judgment and estimates inherent in those policies, are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements. These policies relate to (i) the allowance for credit losses, (ii) accounting for Interest income on our mortgage loan portfolio; (iii) accounting for Investments in securities available-for-sale and Investments in securities held-to-maturity HTM (iv) accounting for Investments in beneficial interests; (v) accounting for Interest expense on our secured borrowings, repurchase facilities, 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes; and (vi) fair values. We believe that the judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time. However, given the sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, the use of other judgments or estimates could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition. For further information, please refer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as there have been no changes to these policies.

Net Interest Income before the Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net interest income before the allowance for credit losses increased 0.6 million versus the prior year quarter as we sold assets with a negative interest rate spread and redeployed capital into higher-yielding CMBS in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net interest income before the allowance for credit losses decreased 4.2 million versus the prior year period primarily as a result of lower average balances on our investment portfolio and lower yields on our investments in beneficial interests. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses increased 0.5 million versus the year ago period due to higher impairment on our investment in beneficial interests as the expected cash flows declined quarter over quarter on lower expected loan prices at liquidation. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses decreased 8.2 million versus the prior year period primarily as a result of reclassifying loans from held to maturity to held-for-sale. Loans held-for-sale are not subject to accounting under CECL and the allowance was reversed and reclassified to the mark to market loss recorded during the same period.

 The average carrying balance of our mortgage loan portfolio decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparative period in 2023 primarily due to loan sales as we reposition our balance sheet into CMBS. Additionally, the average carrying balances of our debt securities, beneficial interests and debt outstanding decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparative period in 2023 due to paydowns, sales and redemptions offset by investments in CMBS. The average carrying balances for our portfolio are included in the table below in thousands):

Loss from Equity Method Investments 
 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Our loss from equity method investments for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was relatively unchanged. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we paid the final management fee to our Former Manager. Also during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we liquidated our investments in two additional equity method investments and reclassified our investment in Gaea out of equity method investments to investments in equity securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We no longer have substantial influence over Gaea and as a result are no longer able to account for our investment using the equity method of accounting. We expect to liquidate our remaining investment in our Former Manager during the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 Loss on Joint Venture Refinancing on Beneficial Interests 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 1.2 million and 11.0 million loss, respectively on the redemption of several of our joint ventures. While the underlying loans from the joint ventures were re-securitized into new joint ventures where we continued to own the same proportionate interest of each class of securities, the transactions are treated as the redemption of the notes and certificates from the original trust. The redemptions proceeds were not sufficient to recover our carrying value of the beneficial interests. As a result, we recorded a loss on the redemptions. Comparatively, no joint ventures were redeemed during the three and nine months September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other Loss/Income 
 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Our other loss increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the prior year primarily due to losses on the sale of our mortgage loans held-for-sale offset by lower losses on our sale of securities. The losses were incurred as we repositioned our balance sheet to investments in CMBS. We did not sell any mortgage loans in 2023. A breakdown of Other loss/income is provided in the table below in thousands):

Expenses 
 
 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by lower loan servicing fee as the average balance of our mortgage loan portfolio declined year over year, lower other expenses and fair value losses on warrants that did no reoccur during the current quarter period. 
 Total expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the management termination fee paid to the Former Manager in shares of our stock, the duplicate management fee paid to our New Manager and the Former Manger from June 10, 2024, through August 26, 2024, and borrowing costs related to the Strategic Transaction. These increases were offset by lower servicing fees as the average balance of our mortgage loan portfolio declined year over year. Additionally, we recorded fair value gains on the Rithm Warrants that were classified as liabilities prior to the closing date of the Strategic Transaction and reclassified to equity on the closing date.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Source and Uses of Cash 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary sources of cash have consisted of proceeds from the sale of residential mortgage loans and securities as well as paydowns and interest income from our investment portfolio. Historically, our primary sources of cash have also included proceeds from our securities offerings, our secured borrowings, repurchase agreements, principal and interest payments on our loan portfolio, principal paydowns on securities, and sales of properties held-for-sale. Depending on market conditions, we expect that our primary financing sources will continue to include secured borrowings, repurchase agreements, and securities offerings in addition to transaction or asset specific funding arrangements and credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities). 
 
 53 

We also may have difficulty accessing the capital markets on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, market events, including inflation and the related Federal Reserve bank actions, may still adversely impact our future operating cash flows due to the inability of some of our borrowers to make scheduled payments on time or at all, and through increased interest rates on secured borrowings and repurchase lines of credit. From time to time, we may invest with third parties and acquire interests in loans and other real estate assets through investments in joint ventures using special purpose entities that can result in investments AFS, investments held-to-maturity and investments in beneficial interests, which are included on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, substantially all of our invested capital was residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage backed securities and CMBS, and beneficial interests. We also held approximately 84.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of 31.2 million from our balance of 52.8 million at December 31, 2023.

 Our operating cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.7 million. Comparatively, our operating cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 34.4 million. Our primary operating cash inflow is cash interest payments on our mortgage loans of 23.8 million and 33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-cash interest income accretion on our mortgage loans was 2.7 million and 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We fund our mortgage loan pools primarily through secured borrowings and repurchase agreements and we fund our debt securities primarily through repurchase agreements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net financing cash outflows of 399.9 million primarily driven by the redemption of our 2024 Notes of 103.5 million, net repayments on our repurchase transactions of 144.3 million, and pay downs of our secured borrowings of 146.1 million.

Financing Activities Equity Offerings 
 
 On February 28, 2020, our board of directors Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to 25.0 million of our common stock.

Financing Activities Secured Borrowings, 2024 Notes and 2027 Notes 
 
 Secured Borrowings 
 
 We historically have financed our business through secured borrowings. The secured borrowings are generally structured as debt financings. The loans included in the secured borrowings remain on our consolidated balance sheet as we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization trusts, which are VIEs. The securitization VIEs are structured as pass through entities that receive principal and interest on the underlying mortgages and distribute those payments to the holders of the notes. Our exposure to the obligations of the VIEs is generally limited to our investments in the entities. The notes that are issued by the securitization trusts are secured solely by the mortgages held by the applicable trusts and not by any of our other assets. The mortgage loans of the applicable trusts are the only source of repayment and interest on the notes issued by such trusts. We do not guarantee any of the obligations of the trusts under the terms of the agreement governing the notes or otherwise. 
 
 Our non-rated secured borrowings are generally structured with Class A notes, subordinated notes, and trust certificates, which have rights to the residual interests in the mortgages once the notes are repaid. We have no non-rated secured borrowing outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our rated secured borrowings are generally structured as REIT TMP transactions which allows us to issue multiple classes of securities without using a REMIC structure or being subject to an entity level tax. Our rated secured borrowings generally issue classes of debt from AAA through mezzanine. We generally retain the mezzanine and residual certificates in the transactions. We have retained the applicable mezzanine and residual certificates from the other four rated secured borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following table sets forth the original terms of all outstanding notes from our secured borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 at their respective cutoff dates:

2024 Notes (Convertible Senior Notes) 
 
 During 2017 and 2018, we completed the public offer and sale of our 2024 Notes, in three separate offerings which form a single series of fungible securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the UPB of the debt was zero and 103.5 million, respectively. The 2024 Notes had an interest rate of 7.25 per annum and were payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2024 Notes matured on April 30, 2024. We redeemed the notes in full on April 30, 2024 for an aggregate amount of 103.5 million and 15 days of accrued interest. 
 
 2027 Notes (Unsecured Notes) 
 
 During August 2022, our Operating Partnership issued 110.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.875 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes were issued at 99.009 of par value and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the guarantors. 
 
 On June 30, 2024, we received notification that the 2027 Notes were downgraded from BBB- to BB+. Under the terms of the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, the downgrade results in a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate from 8.875 to 9.875 beginning on September 1, 2024. 
 
 Under the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, a subsidiary guarantor s guarantee will terminate upon: (i) the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including by way of consolidation) of the subsidiary guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the subsidiary guarantor otherwise permitted by the indenture, (ii) satisfaction of the requirements for legal or covenant defeasance or discharge of the 2027 Notes, or (iii) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture. 
 
 The following table presents summarized financial information for the guarantors and our Operating Partnership, on a combined basis after eliminating (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantor entities and (ii) equity in earnings from, and any investments in, any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor in thousands):

Repurchase Transactions 
 
 The Company has entered into two repurchase facilities whereby the Company, through two wholly-owned Delaware trusts (the Trusts acquires pools of mortgage loans which are then sold by the Trusts, as Seller to a counterparty, the buyer . As of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, only one facility is outstanding. Upon the time of the initial sale to the buyer, the Trust, with a simultaneous agreement, also agrees to repurchase the pools of mortgage loans from the buyer. Mortgage loans sold under these facilities carry interest calculated based on a spread to one-month SOFR, which is fixed for the term of the borrowing. The advance rate is between 75 and 90 of the asset s acquisition price, d The obligations of the Trust to repurchase these mortgage loans at a future date are guaranteed by the Company s Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company has also entered into four repurchase facilities, as of September 30, 2024, substantially similar to the mortgage loan repurchase facilities, but where the pledged assets are the Company s investments in bonds and bonds retained from the Company s secured borrowings. Each repurchase transaction represents its own borrowing. As such, the ceilings associated with these transactions are the amounts currently borrowed at any one time. 
 
 The Company has effective control over the assets subject to all these transactions; therefore, the Company s repurchase transactions are accounted for as financing arrangements. The Operating Partnership, as guarantor, will provide to the buyers a limited guaranty Guaranty of certain losses incurred by the buyers in connection with certain events and/or the Seller s obligations under the mortgage loan purchase agreement, following the breach of certain covenants by the Seller, the occurrence of certain bad acts by the Seller, the occurrence of certain insolvency events of the Seller or other events specified in the Guaranty. As security for its obligations under the Guaranty, the guarantor will pledge the trust certificate representing the guarantor s 100 beneficial interest in the Seller. 
 
 The following table presents certain details of our repurchase transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in thousands): 
 
 Table 13: Repurchase Balances 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Balance at the end of period 231,464 375,745 Maximum outstanding balance during the quarter 266,731 392,024 Average balance 239,810 378,426 
 
 The decrease in our average balance from 378.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, to our average balance of 239.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is a result of paydowns and asset sales. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any credit facilities or other outstanding debt obligations other than the repurchase facilities, secured borrowings, warrant liability, 2024 Notes (as of December 31, 2023) and 2027 Notes. 
 
 We are not required by our investment guidelines to maintain any specific debt-to-equity ratio, and we believe that the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we hold depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets, as well as the general availability and terms of stable and reliable financing for those assets. We do, however, have debt covenants related to our various borrowing arrangements that have minimum liquidity and tangible net worth requirements as well as maximum leverage ratio requirements. Generally, we are required to maintain minimum levels of liquidity (in Cash and cash equivalents) and tangible net worth of 30.0 million and 240.0 million, respectively. Similarly, our leverage ratio cannot exceed 3.5 times equity, excluding our secured borrowings. 
 
 See Note 9 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, for additional details of our repurchase transactions and balances. 

Dividends 
 
 We may declare dividends based on, among other things, our earnings, our financial condition, our working capital needs, new opportunities, and distribution requirements imposed on REITs. The declaration of dividends to our stockholders and the amount of such dividends are at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 58 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Other than our investments in debt securities and beneficial interests issued by joint ventures, which are summarized below by securitization trust, and our equity method investments discussed elsewhere in this report, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any market, credit, liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 
 Table 14: Investments in Joint Ventures 
 
 We form joint ventures with third party institutional accredited investors to purchase mortgage loans and other mortgage related assets. The debt securities and beneficial interests we carry on our consolidated balance sheets are issued by securitization trusts formed by these joint ventures, which are VIEs, that we have sponsored but which we do not consolidate since we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary. 
 
 On January 1, 2023, we transferred 83.0 million of investment securities from AFS to HTM due to sale restrictions under the European risk retention requirements for securitizations. The Company s investment in HTM securities represent the 5.01 the company is required to retain under the European risk retention rules for our secured borrowings (the EU Retained Interest ). Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Pursuant to the terms of these debt securities, the Company must hold at least 5.01 of the nominal value of each class of securities offered or sold to investors and the Company is prohibited from selling, transferring or otherwise surrendering all or part of the EU Retained Interest until all such classes are paid in full or redeemed.

 Our contractual obligations include obligations under repurchase agreements, our 2024 Notes, our 2027 Notes, and accrued interest on these obligations. 
 
 We use repurchase agreements to finance certain acquisitions of mortgage loans and certain debt securities we retain from our securitizations. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our repurchase obligations totaled 231.5 million and 375.7 million, respectively. Our repurchase financing is considered short term in nature as the underlying agreements generally renew within one year. (See Repurchase Transactions above for a further description of our repurchase facilities.) 
 
 Our 2024 Notes had outstanding principal balances of zero and 103.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. On April 30, 2024 , we repaid our 2024 Notes at maturity. 
 
 Our 2027 Notes had an outstanding principal balance of 110.0 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The 2027 Notes will mature on September 1, 2027. 
 
 Our accrued interest expense associated with our repurchase obligations at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was 0.9 million and 2.3 million, respectively. Our interest expense expected to be paid on our 2024 Notes at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was zero and 4.1 million, respectively. Our interest expense expected to be paid on our 2027 Notes at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was 32.6 million and 39.1 million, respectively. Interest expense accrued on our repurchase financings is paid upon the maturity of the financing. Unless the repurchase financing is renewed, we are required to repay the borrowing and any accrued interest, and we concurrently receive back our pledged collateral from the lender. Interest expense on our 2024 Notes was paid quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. Interest expense on our 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. 
 
 Our secured borrowings are not included under our contractual obligations as such borrowings are non-recourse to us and principal and interest are only paid to the extent that cash flows from mortgage loans (in the securitization trust) collateralizing the debt are received. Accordingly, a projection of contractual maturities over the next five years is inapplicable. 

Subsequent Events 
 
 On October 18, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.06 per share to be paid on November 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2024. 
 
 On October 18, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved, and the Company and the New Manager entered into an amendment to the Management Agreement (the Amendment to provide that the base management fee and the incentive fee shall be payable in cash or, at the election of the New Manager, in shares of common stock of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amendment. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The primary components of our market risk are related to real estate risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and credit risk. We seek to actively manage these and other risks and to acquire and hold assets at prices that we believe justify bearing those risks, and to maintain capital levels consistent with those risks. The pandemic presents risks and uncertainties that we describe under Risk Factors and many of these are outside of our control. 

Real Estate Risk 
 
 Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns, public health crises and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing and commercial and residential vacancies); construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. Increases in interest rates will result in lower refinancing volume and potentially higher defaults on CMBS, and home price increases will slow. Decreases in property values may cause us to suffer losses. 
 
 62 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We expect to continue to securitize our whole loan portfolios, primarily as a financing tool, when economically efficient to create long-term, fixed rate, non-recourse financing with moderate leverage, while retaining one or more tranches of the subordinate MBS so created. We expect to continue to utilize repurchase lines of credit as an interim financing tool until we have sufficient volume to execute a secured borrowing. Increases in interest rates will increase our cost of funds for new secured borrowings and our cost of funds on repurchase lines of credit on the repurchase reset date. Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the mortgage loans and real estate underlying our portfolios as well as our financing interest rate expense. Additionally, rises in interest rates may result in a lower refinance volume of our portfolio. 
 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. 
 
 Higher interest rates could be accompanied by inflation and higher household incomes which generally correlate closely to higher rent levels and property values. It is possible that the value of our real estate assets and our net income could decline in a higher interest rate environment to the extent that our real estate assets are financed with floating rate debt and there is no accompanying increase in loan yield and rental yield or property values. 

Prepayment Risk 
 
 Prepayment risk is the risk of change, whether an increase or a decrease, in the rate at which principal is returned in respect of the mortgage loans we own as well as the mortgage loans underlying our retained MBS, including both through voluntary prepayments and through liquidations due to defaults and foreclosures. This rate of prepayment is affected by a variety of factors, including the prevailing level of interest rates as well as economic, demographic, tax, social, legal and other factors. Prepayment rates, besides being subject to interest rates and borrower behavior, are also substantially affected by government policy and regulation. Changes in prepayment rates will have varying effects on the different types of assets in our portfolio. We attempt to take these effects into account. We have historically purchased RPLs and NPLs at discounts from UPB and underlying property values. An increase in prepayments would accelerate the repayment of the discount and lead to increased yield on our assets while also causing re-investment risk that we cannot find additional assets with the same interest and return levels. A decrease in prepayments would likely have the opposite effects. 

Credit Risk 
 
 We are subject to credit risk in connection with our assets. While we will engage in diligence on assets we will acquire, such due diligence may not reveal all of the risks associated with such assets and may not reveal other weaknesses in such assets, which could lead us to misprice acquisitions. Property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns, public health crises and other factors), local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing), changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments, construction quality, age and design, demographic factors and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. 
 
 There are many reasons borrowers will fail to pay including but not limited to, in the case of residential mortgage loans, reductions in personal income, job loss and personal events such as divorce or health problems, and in the case of commercial mortgage loans, reduction in market rents and occupancy and poor property management services by borrowers. We will rely on the Servicer to mitigate our risk. Such mitigation efforts may include loan modifications and prompt foreclosure and property liquidation following a default. If a sufficient number of re-performing borrowers default, our results of operations will suffer, and we may not be able to pay our own financing costs. 

Inflation 
 
 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest-rate sensitive in nature. Increases by the Federal Reserve Bank to mitigate inflation have increased our cost of funds. While the Federal Reserve Bank has recently decreased interest rates, a change in policy would have a negative impact on our variable rate funding and the value of our residential mortgage assets. Additionally, inflation that outpaces wage increases could drive a decrease in disposable household income and increase the credit risk of certain borrowers. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 63 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), such as this Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Based on the controls evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that material information related to our company and our consolidated subsidiaries is made known to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
