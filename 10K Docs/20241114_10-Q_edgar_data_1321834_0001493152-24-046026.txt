 Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

per share Common Stock ceased trading under the ticker symbol MYMD and began trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol TNFA. 

These
condensed consolidated financial statements include two wholly owned subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024, Akers Acquisition Sub, Inc.
and Bout Time Marketing Corporation (together, the Company ). All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

MYMD-1
is an oral, next-generation TNF- inhibitor with the potential to transform the way TNF- based diseases are treated due
to its selectivity and ability to cross the blood brain barrier . Its ease of oral dosing is a significant
differentiator compared to currently available TNF- inhibitors, all of which require delivery by injection or infusion. MYMD-1
has also been shown to selectively block TNF- action where it is overactivated without preventing it from doing its normal job
of responding to routine infection. MYMD-1 is doubly effective at inhibiting inflammation by blocking both TNF-a and IL-6 activity, whereas
currently approved anti-TNF and anti-IL-6 treatments for rheumatoid arthritis can only target one or the other. In addition, in early
clinical studies it has not been associated with serious side effects known to occur with traditional immunosuppressive therapies that
treat inflammation. 

At
the Company s annual meeting of stockholders held on July 31, 2023, the stockholders approved a plan to merge the Company with
and into a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation MyMD Delaware ),
with MyMD Delaware being the surviving corporation, for the purpose of changing the Company s state of incorporation from New
Jersey to Delaware (the Reincorporation ). The Reincorporation was effected as of March 4, 2024. In connection with the
Reincorporation to Delaware, the par value of the Company s Common Stock and preferred stock was changed to 
per share. 

MyMD
Delaware is deemed to be the successor issuer of MyMD New Jersey under Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

The
Reincorporation did not result in any change in the Company s name, business, management, fiscal year, accounting, location of
the principal executive offices, assets or liabilities. In addition, the Company s Common Stock retained the same CUSIP number
and continued to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MYMD. Holders of shares of the Company s
Common Stock did not have to exchange their existing MyMD New Jersey stock certificates for MyMD Delaware stock
certificates. 

As
of the Effective Date of the Reincorporation, the rights of the Company s stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, the MyMD Delaware Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of MyMD Delaware. 

On
February 14, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split ). Simultaneously with the
Reverse Stock Split, number of shares of the Company s Common Stock authorized for issuance was reduced from shares
to shares, and our authorized capital stock was reduced from shares to shares. The Reverse Stock Split
reduced the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, including shares held by the Company as treasury shares. All
share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split, unless stated otherwise. 

On
July 25, 2024, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of the Company s Common Stock from to 
and made a corresponding change to the number of authorized shares of the Company s capital stock by filing a Certificate of Amendment
to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Share Increase ). The Share
Increase was approved by the Company s stockholders at the Company s special meeting of stockholders held on July 24, 2024.

The
Series F Preferred Shares were determined to be more akin to a debt-like host than an equity-like host. The Company identified the following
embedded features that are not clearly and closely related to the debt host instrument: 1) make-whole interest upon a contingent redemption
event, 2) make-whole interest upon a conversion event, 3) an installment redemption upon an Equity Conditions Failure (as defined in

embedded derivative using a Monte Carlo simulation model, with the following inputs; the fair value of our Common Stock of on the
issuance date, estimated equity volatility of , estimated traded volume volatility of , the time to maturity of years,

or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at a price below the then-applicable Exercise Price (subject
to certain exceptions). Upon any such price-based adjustment to the exercise price, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the
Series F Warrants will be increased proportionately. 

The
Series F Warrants were determined to be within the scope of ASC 480-10 as they are puttable to the Company at Holders election
upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the agreements). As such, the Company recorded the Series F Warrants

relating to the rights of the holders of the Series F Warrants to provide that, in the event of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined
in the Series F Warrants) that is not within the Company s control, including the Fundamental Transaction not being approved by
the Company s Board of Directors, the holder of the Series F Warrant shall only be entitled to receive from the Company or any

Series
G Preferred Stock 

The
Series G Preferred Shares became convertible upon issuance into Common Stock (the Series G Conversion Shares at the election
of the holder at any time at an initial conversion price of (the Series G Conversion Price ). The Series G Conversion
Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-based
adjustment in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at
a price below the then-applicable Series G Conversion Price (subject to certain exceptions). At any time after the issuance date of the
Series G Preferred Shares, the Company has the option to redeem in cash all or any portion of the shares of Series G Preferred Shares
then outstanding at a premium upon notice by the Company to all holders of the Series G Preferred Shares. 

The
holders of the Series G Preferred Shares will be entitled to dividends of per annum, compounded monthly, which will be payable in
arrears monthly, at the holder s options, (i) in cash, (ii) in kind in the form of additional shares of Series G
Preferred Shares (the PIK Shares ), or (iii) in a combination thereof, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
Certificate of Designations of the Series G Preferred Shares (the Series G Certificate of Designations ). Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Triggering Event (as defined in the Series G Certificate of Designations), the Series G Preferred Stock
will accrue dividends at the rate of per annum. Upon conversion or redemption, the holders of the Series G Preferred Shares are also
entitled to receive a dividend make-whole payment. The holders of the Series G Preferred Shares will be entitled to vote with holders
of the Common Stock on as as-converted basis, with the number of votes to which each holder of Series G Preferred Share is entitled to
be calculated assuming a conversion price of per share, which was the Minimum Price (as defined in Rule 5635 of the Rule of the
Nasdaq Stock Market) applicable immediately before the execution and delivery of the Series G Purchase Agreement, subject to certain
beneficial ownership limitations as set forth in the Series G Certificate of Designations. During the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, the Company recorded dividends totaling and , respectively, which are reported as Series F Preferred Stock
Dividends on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the
Company recorded dividends totaling and , respectively, which are reported as Series G Preferred Stock Dividends on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company s ability to settle conversions and make dividend make-whole payments using shares of Common Stock is
subject to certain limitations set forth in the Series G Certificate of Designations. Further, the Series G Certificate of Designations
contains a certain beneficial ownership limitation, which applies to each Series G Investor, other than PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc., after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series G Preferred Shares or as part of any dividend
make-whole payment under the Series G Certificate of Designations. 

On
June 17, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the Series G Amendment with the Required Holders (as defined
in the Series G Certificate of Designations). Pursuant to the Series G Amendment, the Required Holders agreed to amend the Series G Certificate
of Designations by filing a Certificate of Amendment Series G Certificate of Amendment to the Series G Certificate of
Designations with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Secretary of State to increase the number of authorized
shares of Series G Preferred Stock from to , in order to authorize a sufficient number of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock for the payment of PIK Shares. On June 17, 2024, the Company filed the Series G Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of
State, thereby amending the Series G Certificate of Designations. The Series G Certificate of Amendment became effective with the Secretary
of State upon filing. 

The
Series G Preferred Shares are classified as temporary equity as the holder of the Series G Preferred Stock has the right to require the
Company to redeem for cash all or any portion of such Holder s shares upon the suspension from trading or the failure of the Common
Stock to be trading or listed (as applicable) on an eligible market for a period of five (5) consecutive Trading Days. The Series G Preferred
Stock is not unconditionally redeemable and is only conditionally puttable at the Holder s option upon this trading suspension
or failure. This would not be considered to be within the Company s control. 

The
estimated fair value of the Series G Preferred Stock on the issuance date of approximately million, was determined utilizing Monte
Carlo simulations. The estimated aggregate fair value of the Warrants of approximately million was determined utilizing the Black
Scholes Model. The aggregate fair value of the Warrants exceeds the aggregate gross proceeds from the transaction as the Warrants were
issued in the money. 

The
approximately million stock discount (contra-Preferred Stock) resulting from the difference between the gross proceeds and the allocated
residual fair value of the Series G Preferred Stock (i.e. 0) is accounted for as a reduction to the carrying value of the Preferred
Stock and is not accreted until redemption becomes probable in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-3A. 

Since
the fair value of the liabilities required to be subsequently measured at fair value exceeds the net proceeds received, the excess of
the fair value over the net proceeds received is recognized as a loss in earnings. As such, the Company recognized a loss on the issuance
of preferred stock of approximately million. 

On
August 8, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the August Series G Amendment with the Required Holders
(as defined in the Series G Certificate of Designations). Pursuant to the August Series G Amendment, the Required Holders agreed to amend
the Series G Certificate of Designations by filing a Certificate of Amendment August Series G Certificate of Amendment to the Series G Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of State to adjust the calculation of the PIK Shares. On August 8, 2024,
the Company filed the August Series G Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State, thereby amending the Series G Certificate
of Designations. The August Series G Certificate of Amendment became effective with the Secretary of State upon filing. 

Series
G Warrants 

The
Series G Preferred Shares were determined to be more akin to a debt-like host than an equity-like host. The Company identified the following
embedded features that are not clearly and closely related to the debt host instrument: 1) make-whole interest upon a contingent redemption
event, 2) make-whole interest upon a conversion event, 3) an installment redemption upon an Equity Conditions Failure (as defined in
the Series F Certificate of Designations), and 4) variable share-settled installment conversion. These features were bundled together,
assigned probabilities of being affected and measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value of these features are recognized
in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. The Company estimated at issuance the fair value of the bifurcated
embedded derivative using a Monte Carlo simulation model, with the following inputs: the fair value of our Common Stock of on the
issuance date, estimated equity volatility of , estimated traded volume volatility of , the time to maturity of years,
a discounted market interest rate of , dividend rate of , a penalty dividend rate of , and probability of default of .
The fair value of the bifurcated derivative liabilities was estimated utilizing the with and without method which uses the probability
weighted difference between the scenarios with the derivative and the plain vanilla maturity scenario without a derivative. 

Pursuant
to the Series G Private Placement, the Company issued to investors (i) the Series G Long-Term Warrants to purchase shares of
Common Stock, with an exercise price of per share (subject to adjustment), for a period of five years from the date of issuance
and (ii) the Series G Short-Term Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price of 1.816 per share (subject
to adjustment), for a period of eighteen months from the date of issuance. 

The
exercise price of the Series G Warrants and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Series G Warrants are subject to customary
adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-based adjustment, on a full
ratchet basis, in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common
Stock, at a price below the then-applicable exercise price (subject to certain exceptions). Upon any such price-based adjustment to the
exercise price, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Series G Warrants will be increased proportionately. 

On
August 16, 2024, the Company entered into (i) an Amendment (the Series G Long Term Warrant Amendment with the Series G
Investors, effective as of June 30, 2024, relating to the Series G Long Term Warrants, and (ii) an Amendment (the Series G Short
Term Warrant Amendment and, together with the Series G Long Term Warrant Amendment, the Series G Warrant Amendments with the Series G Investors, effective as of June 30, 2024, relating to the Series G Short Term Warrants. The Series G Warrant Amendments
modified certain terms of the Series G Warrants relating to the rights of the holders of the Series G Warrants to provide that, in the
event of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Series G Warrants) that is not within the Company s control, including the
Fundamental Transaction not being approved by the Company s Board of Directors, the holder of the Series G Warrant shall only be
entitled to receive from the Company or any successor entity the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at
the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Series G Warrants) of the unexercised portion of such Series G Warrant, that is being offered
and paid to the holders of the Company s Common Stock in connection with the Fundamental Transaction, whether that consideration be in the form of cash, stock or any combination
thereof, or whether the holders of Common Stock are given the choice to receive from among alternative forms of consideration in connection
with the Fundamental Transaction; provided, further, that if holders of Common Stock of the Company are not offered or paid any consideration
in such Fundamental Transaction, such holders of Common Stock will be deemed to have received common stock of the successor entity (which
such successor entity may be the Company following such Fundamental Transaction). Additionally, the Series
G Warrant Amendments amend the definition of Black Scholes Value related to the volatility input which is now an expected volatility
equal to the 60 day volatility, obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg (determined utilizing a 365 day annualization
factor) as of the trading day immediately following the earliest to occur of (1) the public disclosure of the applicable Fundamental
Transaction and (2) the date of a holder s request. The modification resulted in the reclassification of the Series G Warrants
to be considered equity classified as they were no longer in the scope of ASC 815. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the Company remeasured
the Series G Warrants at fair value as of July 25, 2024 ), and recognized the change in fair value as a non-cash
loss and reclassified the Series G Warrants to additional paid-in capital as of July 25, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash gain on the change in fair value
of .

in such jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, European Union, Israel, Japan and South Korea, which if issued are expected to expire
between 2036 and 2041. Management intends to protect all other intellectual property (e.g. copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets)

on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss. 

Patent
Costs 

Patents
may be purchased from third parties. The costs of acquiring the patent are capitalized as patent costs if it represents a future economic
benefit to the Company. Once a patent is acquired it is amortized over its remaining useful life and assessed for impairment when necessary. 

Other
Intangible Assets 

Other
intangible assets that are acquired by the Company, which have definite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortization
and accumulated impairment losses. 

Amortization 

- 

The
Company determines the existence of such impairment by measuring the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)
and comparing such amount to the carrying amount of the assets. An impairment loss, if one exists, is then measured as the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the discounted estimated future cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value of such assets less costs to sell. Asset impairment charges are recorded to reduce the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset that will be sold or disposed of to their estimated fair values. Charges for the asset impairment reduce
the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to their estimated salvage value in connection with the decision to dispose of such assets.

The
Company leased a facility in Tampa, Florida Platt St under an operating lease Platt Street Lease with
annual rentals of to plus certain operating expenses. The Platt Street Lease took effect on April 1, 2022 for a term
of 36 months. The Platt Street Lease was cancelled without penalty effective October 31, 2023. 

The
Company leased a facility in Baltimore, Maryland 2024 Wolfe St under an operating lease 2024 Baltimore Lease with annual rentals of plus certain operating expenses. The 2024 Baltimore Lease took effect on May 1, 2024, for a term of 12
months with automatic renewals unless a sixty-day notice is provided. 

In
accordance with FASB ASC, Topic 842, Leases ASC 842 ), which increases transparency and comparability by recognizing a
lessee s rights and obligations resulting from leases by recording them on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities.
The guidance requires the recognition of the right-of-use ROU assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities
on the balance sheet. 

The
Company utilizes the package of practical expedients permitted within the standard, which allows an entity to forgo reassessing (i) whether
a contract contains a lease, (ii) classification of leases, and (iii) whether capitalized costs associated with a lease meet the definition
of initial direct costs. Also, the Company elected the expedient allowing an entity to use hindsight to determine the lease term and
impairment of ROU assets and the expedient to allow the Company to not have to separate lease and non-lease components. The Company has
also elected the short-term lease accounting policy under which the Company would not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for any
lease that at the commencement date has a lease term of twelve months or less and does not include a purchase option that the Company
is more than reasonably certain to exercise. 

For
operating leases, the lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments. The Company
generally uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases, unless an interest rate is implicitly stated in the lease.
The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, which was determined
using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments
on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The lease term for all the Company s leases includes the non-cancellable period
of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend the lease that the Company is reasonably certain
to exercise, or an option to extend the lease controlled by the lessor. All ROU assets are reviewed for impairment.

There
was no income tax benefit recorded for the losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 since management determined
that the realization of the net deferred tax assets is not more likely than not to be realized and has recorded a full valuation allowance
on the net deferred tax assets. 

The
Company s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax audits is to record such items as a component of general
and administrative expenses. There were amounts accrued for penalties and interest for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023. The Company does not expect its uncertain tax position to change during the next twelve months. Management is currently
unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviations from its position.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
information set forth below should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on April 1, 2024. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates
and projections. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those
indicated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, entitled Risk Factors. References in this discussion and analysis to us, we, 
 our, or the Company refer collectively to TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments
and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available
to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between
these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP
and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting
any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by the Company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC and such reports, collectively, the Filings contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information
that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions
made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are
only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words anticipate, believe, 
 estimate, expect, future, intend, plan, or the negative of these
terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements. Such
statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions,
and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company s business, industry, and the Company s operations and results
of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States,
we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to: 

fluctuation
 and volatility in market price of our Common Stock due to market and industry factors, as well as general economic, political and
 market conditions;

we make these payments in Common Stock, it may result in substantial dilution to the holders of our Common Stock; 

the certificate of designations for each of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Shares,
Series F-1 Preferred Shares and Series G Preferred Shares and the warrants issued concurrently therewith, as applicable, contain anti-dilution
provisions and other adjustment provisions that have resulted in the reduction of the conversion price of such preferred stock and the
exercise price of such warrants and may do so again in the future. These features may increase the number of shares of common stock issuable
upon conversion of such preferred stock or upon the exercise of the warrants;

Overview 

The
Company is focused on developing and commercializing two therapeutic platforms based on well-defined therapeutic targets: MYMD-1 and
Supera-CBD: 

MYMD-1
 is a clinical stage small molecule that is being developed to treat age-related illnesses such as frailty and sarcopenia. MYMD-1
 works by regulating the release of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- , interleukin 6 IL-6 and
 interleukin 17 IL-17 ). MYMD-1 currently is being evaluated in patients with sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss).
 By regulating the immunometabolic system, MYMD-1 can also treat autoimmune disease, including (but not limited to) multiple sclerosis,
 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The Company has significant intellectual property coverage to protect
 these autoimmune indications, as well as therapy as an anti-aging product; 

The
 Company is advancing MYMD-1 in sarcopenia based on positive clinical data from its Phase II trial and previous research findings.
 This previous clinical trial supported the safety profile, including no serious adverse events and no patient dropouts due to an
 adverse event. Serum analysis confirmed the mechanism of action in patients with sarcopenia aged 65-75 years old. These data support
 the protocol in development to assess clinical outcomes in patients with sarcopenia; 

In
 preparation for future studies, the Company and partner Charles River Laboratories completed the dosing in an FDA-required 90-day
 oral gavage electroencephalogram (EEG) safety study in an animal model. This 90-day dog study was designed to complement the GLP
 chronic toxicology studies that have been completed and reported to FDA. This complete toxicology package will inform the duration
 and dosing of future clinical studies; 

An
 Annual Report is in preparation for submission to FDA; 

Supera-CBD
 is a synthetic analog of cannabidiol CBD being developed to treat various conditions, including, but not limited
 to, epilepsy, pain, and anxiety/depression, through its effects on the CB2 receptor, and a monoamine oxidase enzyme MAO type B. Supera-CBD has shown promise in treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, and may benefit from the recent
 re-classification of cannabis-derived products by FDA; 

In
 a pre-clinical evaluation of Supera-CBD for pain (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine - Division of Behavioral Biology),
 Supera-CBD decreased pain, indicating beneficial effects on inflammatory-induced thermal pain sensitivity at all doses tested; 

The
 Company is currently preparing several scientific papers for publication in 2024, including an abstract for submission in the fourth
 quarter 2024 related to the Phase 2 study of MYMD-1 in sarcopenia/frailty to a peer-reviewed publication; 

The
 Company s new management is seeking appropriate speaking opportunities to present the
 Company; 

The
 Company is exploring non-dilutive opportunities to evaluate MYMD-1 in additional indications not previously considered. 

45 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
February 14, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split ). Simultaneously with the
Reverse Stock Split, number of shares of the Company s common stock authorized for issuance was reduced from 500,000,000 shares
to 16,666,666 shares, and our authorized capital stock was reduced from 550,000,000 shares to 66,666,666 shares. The Reverse Stock Split
reduced the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, including shares held by the Company as treasury shares. All
share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split, except as stated otherwise. 

2021
Merger and Milestone Payments 

On
April 16, 2021, pursuant to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated November 11, 2020 (as subsequently
amended, the Merger Agreement ), by and among the Company, previously known as Akers Biosciences, Inc., XYZ Merger Sub,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), and MyMD Pharmaceuticals (Florida), Inc., a Florida corporation
previously known as MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. MyMD Florida ), Merger Sub was merged with and into MyMD Florida, with MyMD
Florida continuing after the merger as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ).
The Merger consideration included potential milestone payments to the pre-Merger MyMD Florida stockholders (the Milestone Payments payable in shares of the Company s Common Stock upon the achievement of certain market capitalization milestone events (the Milestone
Events during the 36-month period immediately following the closing of the Merger (the Milestone Period ). On April
16, 2024, the Milestone Period expired and accordingly, the pre-Merger MyMD Florida stockholders are no longer entitled to any potential
Milestone Payments pursuant to the Merger Agreement. 

The
Company previously owned, through its subsidiary Cystron Biotech, LLC Cystron ), an exclusive license from Premas Biotech
PVT Ltd. Premas with respect to Premas vaccine platform for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and
other coronavirus infections. On April 16, 2021, pursuant to the Contribution and Assignment Agreement, dated March 18, 2021 (the Contribution
Agreement by and among the Company, Cystron, Oravax Medical, Inc. Oravax and, for the limited purpose set forth
therein, Premas, the Company caused Cystron to contribute substantially all of the assets associated with its business of developing
and manufacturing Cystron s COVID-19 vaccine candidate to Oravax. Oravax is pursuing the development of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
The Company s interest in Oravax consists of 13 of Oravax s outstanding shares of capital stock and the rights to a 2.5 
royalty on all future net sales. The Company has evaluated several options with respect to its interest in Oravax, including a potential
distribution of Oravax shares to the Company s stockholders. This would make Oravax a publicly held company. In addition, the Company
currently has the right to designate a member of the board of directors of Oravax, pursuant to which Mr. Joshua Silverman, our Chairman
of the Board, has been designated to serve as a director of Oravax.

Financial
Operations Overview 

We
will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval
for, and successfully commercialize our MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD product candidates. The lengthy process of securing marketing approvals
for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any significant delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals would
materially adversely affect our product candidate s development efforts and our business overall. In addition, if we obtain regulatory
approval for MYMD-1 and/or Supera-CBD, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability
to support product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities. 

We
anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we: 

advance
 the development of our MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD; 

initiate
 and continue research and preclinical and clinical development of potential new product candidates; 

maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property as it pertains to MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD; 

expand
 our infrastructure and facilities to accommodate ongoing development activities; 

establish
 agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, and third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in connection
 with our Supera-CBD preclinical studies, MYMD-1 ongoing and planned clinical trials, Supera-CBD clinical trials and the development
 of our manufacturing capabilities for MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD; 

develop
 the large-scale manufacturing processes and capabilities for the commercialization of our MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD drug products; 

seek
 marketing approvals for our MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials and 

establish
 a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD should we obtain marketing approval. 

As
a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue
our growth strategy.

Components
of our Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We
have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future.
If our research and development efforts with MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD are successful, we may generate revenue from product sales or through
license agreements with third parties. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses are broken into several components, including research and development and general and administrative costs. 

We
expect operating expenses to increase as we progress through the various clinical trials in the development of MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD. 

Research
and Development 

Our
research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development of MYMD-1 and Supera-CBD. These costs include,
but are not limited to: 

Salaries,
 wages and benefits of the research and development staff; 

Contractual
 agreements with third parties including contract research organizations, preclinical activities and clinical trials; 

Outside
 consultants including fees and expenses; 

Laboratory
 supplies and equipment; 

Regulatory
 compliance; and 

Patent
 application and maintenance costs to protect our intellectual property. 

We
utilize third party contractors and consultants with expertise in specific research or development activities to perform work under the
supervision of our researchers. We believe this allows us to control costs and to progress through the development cycle and to utilize
our staff more efficiently. 

It
is difficult to project with absolute accuracy the duration or final cost of the development of MYMD-1 and Super-CBD or if revenue will
be generated from the commercialization of these components. The process of achieving regulatory approval is very costly and time consuming.
A few of the many factors that contribute to costs of duration include: 

Size
 and scope of pre-clinical trials; 

The
 phases of clinical development and the stage of our product candidates in the cycle; 

Per
 subject trial costs; 

The
 number of sites required for the trials and the availability of appropriate sites to perform the trials; 

The
 time that is required to enroll the appropriate number of trial participants; and 

The
 time required to achieve the approval of regulatory agencies. 

48 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, wages and benefits for our employees in the executive, legal and accounting
functions and third-party costs for legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations, stock market and board expenses. 

Although
treated as components of general and administrative expenses, we have chosen to disclose the following significant items separately: 

Stock
Based Compensation 

Stock-based
compensation includes the fair market value, as determined using the Black-Scholes options pricing model, of stock options issued to
key staff and consultants. 

Warrant
Issuance Expenses 

Warrant
issuance expenses represent the portion of the fees and offering expenses incurred in connection with the February 2023 Offering attributable
to the issuance of the Series F Warrants. 

Other
Income (Expense), net 

Other
income (expense), net consists of interest and dividends earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, gains/(losses) on the
sale of marketable securities, gains/(losses) on the changes of fair value of equity investments, gains/(losses) on the changes of fair
value of warrant liabilities, gains/(losses) on the changes of fair value of derivative liabilities, and an uninsured casualty loss.

control, including the Fundamental Transaction not being approved by the Company s Board of Directors, the holder of the Series
F-1 Warrant shall only be entitled to receive from the Company or any successor entity the same type or form of consideration (and in
the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value (as defined in the Series F-1 Warrants) of the unexercised portion of such Series F-1
Warrant, that is being offered and paid to the holders of the Company s Common Stock in connection with the Fundamental Transaction.
Additionally, the Series F-1 Warrant Amendments amend the definition of Black Scholes Value related to the volatility input which is
now an expected volatility equal to the 30 day volatility, obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg (determined utilizing
a 365 day annualization factor) as of the trading day immediately following the earliest to occur of (1) the public disclosure of the
applicable Fundamental Transaction and (2) the date of a holder s request. The modification resulted in the reclassification of
the Series F-1 Warrants to be considered equity classified as they were no longer in the scope of ASC 815. In accordance with ASC 815-40,
the Company remeasured the Series F-1 Warrants at fair value as of July 25, 2024, the effective date of the modifications, and recognized
the change in fair value as a non-cash loss and reclassified the Series F-1 Warrants to additional paid-in capital as of July 25, 2024.

factor) as of the trading day immediately following the earliest to occur of (1) the public disclosure of the applicable Fundamental

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination
of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may
be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements
include estimates associated with the determinations of the fair-market value of the preferred stock, stock-based compensation, and the
impairment analysis of intangibles. 

Our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies we have adopted. In order to get a full
understanding of our financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. A summary of our
critical accounting policies is presented within the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities in our financial statements. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances,
and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events,
and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions
on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our
critical accounting estimates have not changed materially from those previously reported in our Annual Report for the year ended December
31, 2023, on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time we are party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Future litigation may be necessary
to defend ourselves and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to
establish our proprietary rights. For a description of certain legal proceedings, please read Note 7 to the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

The
following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with
our business, financial condition and results of operations previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual
Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. Our business, financial condition and
operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described
below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially
from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 

The
following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other
statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q. 

Holders
of our Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock are entitled to certain payments under the applicable
Certificate of Designations that may be paid in cash, in shares of Common Stock or in additional shares of Series G Preferred Stock depending
on the circumstances. If we make these payments in cash, it may require the expenditure of a substantial portion of our cash resources.
If we make these payments in Common Stock, it may result in substantial dilution to the holders of our Common Stock. 

Under
the Series F Certificate of Designations and Series F-1 Certificate of Designations, we are required to redeem the shares of the shares
of the Series F Preferred Stock and Series F-1 Preferred Stock in equal monthly installments commencing July 1, 2023, and December 1,
2024, respectively. Such holders are also entitled to receive dividends, payable in arrears monthly, and dividends payable on installment
dates shall be paid as part of the applicable installment amount. Installment amounts are payable, at the Company s election, in
shares of Common Stock or, subject to certain limitations, in cash. Installment amounts paid in cash must be paid in the amount of 105 
of the applicable payment amount due. 

Our
ability to make payments due to the holders of our Series F Preferred Stock and Series F-1 Preferred Stock using shares of Common Stock
is subject to certain limitations set forth in the applicable Certificate of Designations. If we are unable to make installment payments
in shares of Common Stock, we may be forced to make such payments in cash. Additionally, the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock
are entitled to dividends of 10 per annum, compounded monthly, which are payable in arrears monthly, at the holder s sole discretion,
in cash, or in kind in the form of additional Series G Preferred Stock, or a combination thereof. If we do not have sufficient
cash resources to make these payments, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital, and we cannot provide any assurance that
we will be successful in doing so. If are unable to raise sufficient capital to meet our payment obligations, we may need to delay, reduce
or eliminate certain research and development programs or other operations, sell some or all of our assets or merge with another entity. 

Our
ability to make payments due to the holders of our Series F Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock using
cash is also limited by the amount of cash we have on hand at the time such payments are due as well as certain provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the DGCL ). Further, we intend to make the installment payments due to holders of Series F Preferred
Stock and Series F-1 Preferred Stock in the form of Common Stock to the extent allowed under the applicable Certificate of Designation
and applicable law in order to preserve our cash resources. The issuance of shares of Common Stock to the holders of our Series F Preferred
Stock and Series F-1 Preferred Stock with increase the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and could result in substantial dilution
to the existing holders of our Common Stock. 

62 

The
Certificate of Designations for the Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock and the warrants
issued concurrently therewith contain anti-dilution provisions that may result in the reduction of the conversion price of the applicable
preferred stock or the exercise price of such warrants in the future. These features may increase the number of shares of Common Stock
being issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock or upon the exercise
of the warrants. 

The
Series F Certificate of Designations, Series F-1 Certificate of Designations and Series G Certificate of Designations and the warrants
issued concurrently therewith, contain anti-dilution provisions, which provisions require the lowering of the applicable conversion price
or exercise, as then in effect, to the purchase price of equity or equity-linked securities issued in subsequent offerings. If in the
future, while any of our Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series F Warrants, Series F-1
Warrants or Series G Warrants are outstanding, we issue securities for a consideration per share of Common Stock (the New Issuance
Price that is less than the applicable conversion price of our preferred stock or the exercise price of the Series F Warrants,
Series F-1 Warrants or Series G Warrants, as then in effect, we will be required, subject to certain limitations and adjustments as provided
in the applicable Certificate of Designations or the applicable warrants, to reduce the conversion price or the exercise price to be
equal to the New Issuance Price, which will result in a greater number of shares of Common Stock being issuable upon conversion or exercise,
as applicable, which in turn will increase the dilutive effect of such conversion or exercise on existing holders of our Common Stock.
It is possible that we will not have a sufficient number of shares available to satisfy the conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock,
Series F-1 Preferred Stock or Series G Preferred Stock or the exercise of the Series F Warrants, Series F-1 Warrants or Series G Warrants
if we enter into a future transaction that reduces the applicable conversion price or exercise price. If we do not have a sufficient
number of available shares for any such conversions or any such warrant exercises, we may need to seek shareholder approval to increase
the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock, which may not be possible and will be time consuming and expensive. The potential
for such additional issuances may depress the price of our Common Stock regardless of our business performance and may make it difficult
for us to raise additional equity capital while any of our Series F Preferred Stock, Series F-1 Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock
or Series F Warrants, Series F-1 Warrants or Series G Warrants are outstanding. 

Under
the February 2023 SPA and Purchase Agreements, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants that may make it difficult to procure
additional financing. 

The
February 2023 SPA, pursuant to which we issued the Series F Preferred Stock, contains, among others, the following restrictive covenants:
(i) until all of the Series F Warrants are exercised, we agreed not to enter into any variable rate transactions; and (ii) until the
later of no shares of Series F Preferred Stock being outstanding and the maturity date of the Series F Preferred Stock, the opportunity
to participate in any subsequent securities offerings by us. The Series F-1 Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued the Series
F-1 Preferred Stock, contains, among others, the following restrictive covenants: (i) until all of the Series F-1 Warrants are exercised,
we agreed not to enter into any variable rate transactions; and (ii) until the later of no shares of Series F-1 Preferred Stock being
outstanding and the maturity date, the opportunity to participate in any subsequent securities offerings by us. The Series G Purchase
Agreement, pursuant to which we issued the Series G Preferred Stock, contains, among others, the following restrictive covenants: (i)
until all of the Series G Warrants are exercised, we agreed not to enter into any variable rate transactions; and (ii) until the later
of no shares of Series G Preferred Stock being outstanding and the second anniversary of the Series G Closing Date, the opportunity to
participate in any subsequent securities offerings by us. 

If
we require additional funding while these restrictive covenants remain in effect, we may be unable to effect a financing transaction
while remaining in compliance with the terms of the February 2023 SPA or Purchase Agreements, or we may be forced to seek a waiver from
the investors party to the February 2023 SPA and Purchase Agreements. 

We
may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position. 

Our
success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We will primarily rely on
patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
technologies or processes. It is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose proprietary
technologies and processes, despite efforts by the us to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. While we hold rights in
several patents, there can be no assurances that any additional patents will be issued, or additional rights will be granted, to us.
Even if new patents are issued, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to adequately protect our technology and processes.
Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around the patents to which we have rights. 

Currently,
the Company has 17 issued U.S. patents, 68 foreign patents, two pending U.S. patent applications and 7 foreign patent applications pending
in such jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, European Union, Israel, Japan, and South Korea and one pending international patent
application, which if issued are expected to expire between 2036 and 2041. Although we expect to obtain additional patents and in-licenses
in the future, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully obtain such patents or in-licenses in a timely manner or at
all. Further, any of our rights to existing patents, and any future patents issued to us, may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.
As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective
enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents or rights to patents do not adequately protect our technology or
processes, competitors may be able to offer products similar to our products.
