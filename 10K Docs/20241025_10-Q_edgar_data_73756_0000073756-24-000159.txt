 or more owned and controlled subsidiaries. We also consolidate entities that are determined to be variable interest entities if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary; otherwise, we account for those entities using the equity method of accounting. We use the equity method to account for our investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies of which we own an equity interest of between and and as to which we have significant influence, but not control, over operations. We use the cost method for all other long-term investments. Investments in entities that we do not consolidate are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

and consideration of reasonable supportable forecasts of economic indicators. Changes in estimates, developing trends and other new information could have material effects on future evaluations. 
 We monitor the credit quality of our accounts receivable and other financing receivable amounts by frequent customer interaction, following economic and industry trends and reviewing specific customer data. Our other receivable amounts include contract assets and held-to-maturity loans receivable, which we consider to have a low risk of loss. 
 We consider macroeconomic conditions when assessing our credit risk exposure, including any impacts from the conflicts in Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, volatility in the financial services industry and the oil and natural gas markets, and the effects thereof on our customers and various counterparties. We have determined the impacts to our credit loss expense are de minimis for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our allowance for credit losses was million for accounts receivable and million for other receivables. As of December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was million for accounts receivable and million for other receivables. Our total allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year, were relatively flat.

 million in financial assets. During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, we did not write off any financial assets. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, we received million of cash proceeds as a partial recovery of a previously written off financial asset. 
 Accounts receivable are considered to be past due after the end of the contractual terms agreed to with the customer. There were no material past due amounts that we consider uncollectible for our financial assets as of September 30, 2024. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.

 million and million, respectively, and during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, we recognized projected losses of million and million, respectively, for entertainment business contracts in our Manufactured Products segment. There could be adjustments to overall contract costs in the future, due to changes in facts and circumstances. 
 In general, our payment terms consist of those services billed regularly as provided and those products delivered at a point in time, which are invoiced after the performance obligation is satisfied. Our product and service contracts with milestone payments due at agreed progress points during the contract are invoiced when those milestones are reached, which may differ from the timing of revenue recognition. Our payment terms generally do not provide financing of contracts to customers, nor do we receive financing from customers as a result of these terms. 
 See Note 3 Revenue for more information on our revenue from contracts with customers.

 years for land and buildings. These leases are negotiated on commercial terms at market rates and many carry standard options to extend or terminate at our discretion. When the exercise of those options is reasonably certain, we include them in the lease assessment. Our leases do not contain material restrictions or covenants that impact our accounting for them, nor do we provide residual value guarantees. 
 As a lessee, we utilize the practical expedients to not recognize leases with an initial lease term of months or less on the balance sheet and to combine lease and non-lease components together and account for the combined component as a lease for all asset classes, except real estate. 
 Right-of-use operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement or modification date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at commencement or modification date in determining the present value of future payments. In determining the incremental borrowing rate, we considered our external credit ratings, bond yields for us and our identified peers, the risk-free rate in geographic regions where we operate, and the impact associated with providing collateral over a similar term as the lease for an amount equal to the future lease payments. Our right-of-use operating lease assets also include any lease prepayments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 million and million of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We recorded million and ) million of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Those amounts are included as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Contract Balances 
 Our contracts with milestone payments have, in the aggregate, a significant impact on the contract asset and the contract liability balances. Milestones are contractually agreed with customers and relate to significant events across the contract lives. Some milestones are achieved before revenue is recognized, resulting in a contract liability, while other milestones are achieved after revenue is recognized, resulting in a contract asset.

 Performance Obligations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was million. In arriving at this value, we have used two expedients available to us and are not disclosing amounts in relation to performance obligations: (1) that are part of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less; or (2) on contracts where we recognize revenue in line with the billing. Of this amount, we expect to recognize revenue of million over the next 12 months, million within the next 24 months, and substantially all of the remaining balance of million within the next 36 months. 
 In our Manufactured Products and ADTech segments, we have long-term contracts that extend beyond one year, and these make up the majority of the performance obligations balance reported as of September 30, 2024. We also have shorter-term product contracts with an expected original duration of one year or less that have been excluded. 
 Where appropriate, we have made estimates within the transaction price of elements of variable consideration within the contracts and constrained those amounts to a level where we consider it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The amount of revenue recognized in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, that was associated with performance obligations completed or partially completed in prior periods was not significant. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no significant outstanding liability balances for refunds or returns due to the nature of our contracts and the services and products we provide. Our warranties are limited to assurance warranties that are of a standard length and are not considered to be material rights . The majority of our contracts consist of a single performance obligation. When there are multiple obligations, we look for observable evidence of stand-alone selling prices on which to base the allocation. This involves judgment as to the appropriateness of the observable evidence relating to the facts and circumstances of the contract. If we do not have observable evidence, we estimate stand-alone selling prices by taking a cost-plus-margin approach, using typical margins from the type of product or service, customer and regional geography involved. 
 
 Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract 
 In line with the available practical expedient, we capitalize incremental costs to obtain a contract that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained when those amounts are significant and the contract is expected at inception to exceed one year in duration. Our costs to obtain a contract primarily consist of bid and proposal costs, which are generally expensed in the period when incurred. There were no balances or amortization of costs to obtain a contract in the current reporting periods. 
 
 Costs to fulfill a contract primarily consist of certain mobilization costs incurred to provide services or products to our customers. These costs are deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance. The closing balance of costs to fulfill a contract was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we recorded amortization expense

 million and million, respectively. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, we recorded amortization expense of million and million, respectively. No impairment costs were recognized.

 , primarily due to the geographical mix of revenue and earnings, changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, and other discrete items. We do not believe a comparison of the effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is meaningful. We continue to make an assertion to indefinitely reinvest the unrepatriated earnings of any foreign subsidiary that would incur material tax consequences upon the distribution of such earnings. 
 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we received refunds of million, including interest of million which was recorded as a tax benefit, under the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). We classified million of the 23 million total refund as other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 
 We conduct our international operations in jurisdictions that have varying laws and regulations regarding income and other taxes, some of which are subject to different interpretations. We recognize benefit for an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority. If this threshold is met, the uncertain tax position is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that we believe is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
 We have accrued a net total of million and million in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for worldwide unrecognized tax liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We account for any applicable interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in our management's judgment related to those liabilities would affect our effective income tax rate in the periods of change. 
 Our tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities in multiple jurisdictions. These audits often take years to complete and settle. 
 United Kingdom Norway Angola Brazil Australia 
 
 We have ongoing tax audits and judicial tax appeals in various jurisdictions. The outcome of these audits and judicial tax appeals may have an impact on uncertain tax positions for income tax returns subsequently filed in those jurisdictions.

 2028 Senior Notes. In February 2018, we completed the public offering of million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2028 (the Existing 2028 Senior Notes and on October 2, 2023, we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of additional 2028 Senior Notes (the New 2028 Senior Notes and, together with the Existing 2028 Senior Notes, the 2028 Senior Notes ). The New 2028 Senior Notes constituted an additional issuance of the Existing 2028 Senior Notes and form a single series with such notes. We pay interest on the 2028 Senior Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 2028 Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on February 1, 2028. The indentures governing our 2028 Senior Notes generally limit our ability to incur secured debt for borrowed money (such as borrowings under our revolving credit facility) to of our Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in such indentures) and contain various other covenants and events of default. We may redeem some or all of the 2028 Senior Notes at specified redemption prices. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase or redeem any of the 2028 Senior Notes. 
 
 Revolving Credit Agreement. On April 8, 2022, we entered into a new senior secured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks (as amended by an Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated September 20, 2023, the Revolving Credit Agreement ). The commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement are scheduled to mature on April 8, 2027. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and

We will also pay a facility fee based on the amount of the underlying commitment that is being utilized, which fee varies from to , with the higher rate owed when we use the Revolving Credit Facility less. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis, based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The maximum permitted Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio was initially to and subsequently decreased to to . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the maximum permitted Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio was to and will not change during the remaining term of the Revolving Credit Facility. The minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) is to throughout the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility may be limited by these financial covenants and the requirement that any borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility not require the granting of any liens to secure any senior notes issued by us. The indentures governing the 2028 Senior Notes generally limit our ability to incur secured debt for borrowed money (such as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) to of our Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in such indentures). As of September 30, 2024, the full million was available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are customary for agreements of this nature, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability and the ability of each of our subsidiaries to incur debt, grant liens, make certain investments, make distributions, merge or consolidate, sell assets and enter into certain restrictive agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 
 Debt Issuance Costs, Discounts and Interest. We incurred million of issuance costs related to the 2028 Senior Notes and million of loan costs related to the Revolving Credit Agreement. These costs, net of accumulated amortization, are included as a reduction of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets, as they pertain to the 2028 Senior Notes, and in other noncurrent assets, as they pertain to the Revolving Credit Agreement. We are amortizing these costs to interest expense through the respective maturity dates for the 2028 Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we amortized million and million to interest expense, respectively. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, we amortized million and million to interest expense, respectively. In addition, in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, we amortized million and million to interest expense, respectively, for issuance costs related to our 4.650 Senior Notes due 2024 that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 We recorded a discount of million related to the 2028 Senior Notes issued in October 2023. This cost, net of accumulated amortization, is included as a reduction of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of the 2028 Senior Notes using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method. In the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we amortized million and million, respectively, to interest expense.

 million as of September 30, 2024, based on quoted prices. Since the market for the 2028 Senior Notes is not an active market, the fair value of the 2028 Senior Notes is classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy under U.S. GAAP (inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full terms for the assets or liabilities). 
 
 Any conversion of cash balances in deposit accounts in Angola from kwanza to U.S. dollars is controlled by the central bank in Angola. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the equivalent of approximately million and million, respectively, of kwanza cash balances in Angola reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 To mitigate our currency exposure risk in Angola, we have used kwanza to purchase equivalent Angolan central bank (Banco Nacional de Angola) bonds. These bonds are denominated as U.S. dollar equivalents, so that, upon payment of semi-annual interest and principal upon maturity, payment will be made in kwanza, equivalent to the respective U.S. dollars at the then-current exchange rate. In the third quarter of 2024, we purchased million of U.S. dollar equivalent Angolan bonds. These bonds mature in February 2031. Because we intend to sell the bonds if we are able to repatriate the proceeds, we have classified these bonds as available-for-sale securities, and they are recorded at fair market value in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. We did not sell any of our Angolan bonds in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. We estimated the fair market value of the Angolan bonds to be million as of September 30, 2024, using quoted market prices. Since the market for the Angolan bonds was not an active market, the fair value of the Angolan bonds was classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy under U.S. GAAP. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had million of U.S. dollar equivalent Angolan bonds that were classified as available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair market value in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These bonds matured on September 1, 2023, and we received cash proceeds of million. 
 
 In the three-month period ended June 30, 2021, we were notified by a customer in our Manufactured Products segment that it was suspending a contract that was substantially complete. Specific to this contract, we billed million of accounts receivable and received million during the first nine months of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding contract assets of approximately million for the contract and contract liabilities for deferred revenue of million.

 , provided the individual meets certain age and years-of-service requirements. For the grants of restricted stock units to each of the participant employees, the participant will be issued one share of our common stock for each of the participant s vested restricted stock units at the earlier of or, if the participant vested earlier after meeting the age and service requirements, following termination of employment or service, however, the restricted stock units outstanding have no voting or dividend rights. The grants of restricted stock to our nonemployee directors generally vest in full on the first anniversary of the award date, conditional upon continued service as a director, except for the 2023 grant to one director who retired from our board of directors as of the date of our annual meeting of shareholders in May 2023, which vested on that date. Each grantee of shares of restricted stock is deemed to be the record owner of those shares during the restriction period, with the right to vote and receive any dividends on those shares. 
 
 For each of the restricted stock units granted in 2022 through September 30, 2024, at the earlier of after grant or at termination of employment or service, the grantee will be issued one share of our common stock for each unit vested. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respective totals of and shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units were outstanding. 
 
 We estimate that share-based compensation cost not yet recognized related to shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units, based on their grant-date fair values, was million as of September 30, 2024. This expense is being recognized on a graded-vesting basis over for awards attributable to individuals meeting certain age and years-of-service requirements, and on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period of one or three years for the other awards. 
 
 Share Repurchase Plan. In December 2014, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million shares of our common stock on a discretionary basis. Under the program, which has no expiration date, we had repurchased million shares for million through December 31, 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased million shares for approximately million. We are not obligated to make any future repurchases. We account for the shares we hold in treasury under the cost method, at average cost.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Certain statements we make in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations about: 
 
 increased costs to operate our business, including the availability and market for our chartered vessels; 
 future demand, order intake and business activity levels; 
 the collectability of accounts receivable and realizability of contract assets at the amounts reflected on our most recent consolidated balance sheet; 
 the backlog of our Manufactured Products segment, to the extent backlog may be an indicator of future revenue or productivity; 
 tax refunds and the expected timing thereof; 
 our tax payments and projected capital expenditures for 2024; 
 the adequacy of our liquidity, cash flows and capital resources to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives; 
 transactions we may engage in to manage our outstanding debt prior to maturity; 
 shares that may be repurchased under our share repurchase plan; 
 seasonality; and 
 industry conditions. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those we have referred to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process, as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate, we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward-looking information. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Overview of our Results 
 
 Our diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were 0.40 and 0.89, respectively, as compared to 0.29 and 0.52, respectively, for the corresponding periods of the prior year. In the third quarter of 2024, activity levels in our energy-focused businesses remained steady year-over-year, with notable operating performance improvements year-over-year in our Subsea Robotics and Manufactured Products segments. Compared to the same periods in the prior year, our operating income was 23 higher on a 7 increase in revenue and our operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 26 higher on a 10 increase in revenue. 
 
 In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we utilized 36 million of cash for maintenance capital expenditures and 37 million for growth capital expenditures, which was funded from our 75 million of cash provided by operating activities. We also repurchased shares of our common stock for approximately 10 million. These items along with the sale of an equity investment and assets and purchase of debt securities were contributors to our 9.7 million cash reduction during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 We operate in five business segments. Our segments are contained within two businesses services and products provided primarily to the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the mobility solutions and offshore renewables

 industries, among others Energy ), and services and products provided to non-energy industries (Aerospace and Defense Technologies ADTech )). Our four business segments within the Energy business are Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, Offshore Projects Group OPG and Integrity Management Digital Solutions IMDS ). We report our ADTech business as one segment. Our Unallocated Expenses are those not associated with a specific business segment. 
 
 Consolidated revenue and profitability information are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (dollars in thousands) Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Revenue 679,811 635,180 1,947,711 1,770,077 Operating Income (Loss) 71,333 57,929 168,390 133,878 Operating Income (Loss) 10 9 9 8 
 
 We generate a material amount of our consolidated revenue from contracts for services in the United States U.S. Gulf of Mexico in our OPG segment, which is usually more active in the second and third quarters, as compared to the rest of the year. Revenue in our Subsea Robotics segment is subject to seasonal variations in demand, with our first quarter generally being the low quarter of the year. The level of our Subsea Robotics seasonality depends on the number of remotely operated vehicles ROV s) we have engaged in vessel-based subsea infrastructure inspection, maintenance, repair and installation, which is more seasonal than drilling support. Revenue in each of our Manufactured Products, IMDS and ADTech segments generally has not been seasonal. 
 
 Energy 
 
 The primary focus of our Energy business is maintaining the positive momentum from our operational efficiency programs that leverage our asset base and capabilities for providing services and products for offshore energy operations and subsea completions. These efforts continue to benefit us during the current upstream spending cycle that is consistent with the ongoing increase in global demand for energy. We also are focused on deploying our capabilities to grow business in mobile robotics, offshore wind installations, nuclear, and other clean energy solutions. 
 
 The table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for the business segments within our Energy business. In the Subsea Robotics section of the table that follows, ROV days utilized is the number of ROV days for which we earn revenue during a specified period. ROV days available includes all days from the first day that a ROV is placed into service until the ROV is retired. All days in this period are considered available days, including periods when a ROV is undergoing maintenance or repairs. Our ROVs do not have scheduled maintenance or repair that requires significant time during which the ROVs are not available for utilization. ROV utilization percentage is defined as ROV days utilized divided by ROV days available.

 Subsea Robotics. We believe we are the world's largest provider of ROV services and, generally, this business segment has been the largest contributor to our Energy business operating income. Our Subsea Robotics segment revenue reflects the ROV utilization percentages, fleet sizes and average pricing in the respective periods. Our ROV tooling provides an additional operational interface between an ROV and equipment located subsea. Our survey services business provides survey and positioning, and geoscience services. The following table presents revenue from ROV services as a percentage of total Subsea Robotics revenue: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 ROV 77 76 78 77 Other 23 24 22 23 
 
 Subsea Robotics operating income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, increased as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year on higher revenue, as a result of higher average revenue per day in 2024 resulting from improved ROV pricing.

Table of Contents 

 Fleet utilization was 69 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Fleet utilization decreased slightly to 67 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 68 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. We retired five of our conventional work-class ROV systems and replaced them with five upgraded conventional work-class ROV systems during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in a total of 250 ROVs in our ROV fleet as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Manufactured Products. Our Manufactured Products segment provides distribution systems such as production control umbilicals and connection systems made up of specialty subsea hardware, along with clamp connectors and subsea and topside control valves. We also provide turnkey solutions that include program management, engineering design, fabrication/assembly and installation of autonomous mobile robotic technology to industrial, manufacturing, healthcare, warehousing and commercial theme park markets. 
 
 Our Manufactured Products revenue and operating results increased for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. Revenue was higher in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased order intake in 2022 and 2023 leading to increased activity in the first nine months of 2024. Operating results were improved in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to an improved project mix and our ability to leverage our existing cost base. 
 
 Our Manufactured Products backlog was 671 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 622 million and 556 million as of as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.21 for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 1.41 for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Offshore Projects Group. Our OPG segment provides a broad portfolio of integrated subsea project capabilities and solutions as follows: 
 
 subsea installation and intervention, including riserless light well intervention RLWI services, inspection, maintenance and repair IMR services, principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola, utilizing owned and chartered vessels; 
 installation and workover control systems IWOCS and ROV workover control systems RWOCS 
 diving services; 
 decommissioning services; 
 project management and engineering; and 
 drill pipe riser services and systems and wellhead load relief solutions. 
 
 Our OPG operating results decreased on lower revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to changes in project mix in our international markets, vessel crane repair costs and associated vessel downtime in the third quarter of 2024. Our OPG operating results decreased on higher revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, primarily due to changes in the project mix and drydock expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Integrity Management Digital Solutions. Our IMDS segment provides asset integrity management, corrosion management, inspection and nondestructive testing services, principally to customers in the oil and gas, power generation and petrochemical industries. We perform these services on both onshore and offshore facilities, both topside and subsea. We also provide software, digital and connectivity solutions for the energy industry. 
 
 Our IMDS operating results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 decreased on higher revenue as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to increased revenue and operating results for our integrity management business while our energy businesses were relatively flat. The decline in operating income was the result of a one-time, non-cash charge associated with the divestiture of our Maritime Intelligence division in September 2024.

 Aerospace and Defense Technologies 
 
 Our ADTech segment provides government services and products, including engineering and related manufacturing in defense and space exploration activities, principally to U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors. Many of the services and products utilized in ADTech are applied technologies based on our core competencies and knowledge derived from decades of working in the offshore markets and solving complex problems in harsh environments. 
 
 Revenue and operating income (loss) information for our ADTech segment are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (dollars in thousands) Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Revenue 99,201 98,631 294,123 281,931 Operating Income (Loss) 12,219 14,140 32,271 33,993 Operating Income (Loss) 12 14 11 12 
 
 ADTech operating results for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, declined on relatively flat revenue when compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to increased project proposal costs and changes in project mix. ADTech operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, declined on higher revenue when compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. While ADTech experienced increased activity and margins in our defense subsea technologies business, such increase was offset by a reserve taken during the second quarter of 2024 for a contract dispute and lower activity levels in our space systems business. 
 
 Unallocated Expenses 
 
 Our Unallocated Expenses i.e. , those not associated with a specific business segment) consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans, including restricted stock units, performance units and bonuses, as well as other general expenses that are recorded in gross margin, plus selling, general and administrative expenses related to corporate functions:

 Our Unallocated Expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year primarily due to lower professional fees. Our Unallocated Expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, were higher as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year primarily due to higher information technology costs relating primarily to increased cybersecurity protection costs. 
 
 Other 
 
 The following table sets forth our significant financial statement items below the operating income (loss) line.

Table of Contents 

 Interest income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, decreased primarily due to lower cash balances. 
 
 In addition to interest on borrowings, interest expense includes amortization of loan costs, interest rate swap settlements and debt discount, fees for lender commitments under our senior secured revolving credit agreement and fees for standby letters of credit and bank guarantees that banks issue on our behalf for performance bonds, bid bonds and self-insurance requirements. Interest expense for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, was slightly lower. 
 
 Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are the principal component of other income (expense), net. In the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of 0.4 million and 0.9 million, respectively. In the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of 3.7 million and (3.6) million, respectively. The currency gains (losses) in the 2024 and 2023 periods were primarily resulting from foreign currency fluctuations in multiple countries. We could incur further foreign currency exchange gains (losses) in countries where we operate due to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. 
 
 Our tax provision is based on (1) our earnings for the period and other factors affecting the tax provision and (2) the operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries that are subject to local income and withholding taxes. Factors that affect our tax rate include our profitability levels in general and the geographical mix of our results. The effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was different than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , primarily due to the geographical mix of revenue and earnings, changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, and other discrete items. We do not believe a comparison of the effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is meaningful. We continue to make an assertion to indefinitely reinvest the unrepatriated earnings of any foreign subsidiary that would incur material tax consequences upon the distribution of such earnings. 
 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we received refunds of 23 million, including interest of 1.7 million, which was recorded as a tax benefit under the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). We classified 20 million of the 23 million total refund as other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Our income tax payments for the full year of 2024 are estimated to be in the range of 85 million to 95 million, which includes taxes incurred in countries that impose tax on the basis of in-country revenue, without regard to the profitability of such operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations, capital commitments (including future share repurchases) and strategic growth initiatives. Our ability to generate substantial cash flow over the last several years has allowed us to reduce our long-term debt while maintaining a strong liquidity position. As of September 30, 2024, we had net working capital of 611 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 452 million. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had 215 million of unused commitments through our senior secured revolving credit agreement that we entered into in April 2022 (as amended by an Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, dated September 20, 2023, the Revolving Credit Agreement ). Availability under the 215 million revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility may be limited by certain financial covenants and the requirement that any borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility not require the granting of any liens to secure any senior notes issued by us. The indentures governing the 2028 Senior Notes (defined below) generally limit our ability to incur secured debt for borrowed money (such as borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) to 15 of our Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in such indentures). 
 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 Our nearest maturity of indebtedness is 500 million of our 2028 Senior Notes scheduled to mature on February 1, 2028 (the 2028 Senior Notes ). From time to time, we may engage in certain transactions in order to manage our outstanding debt prior to maturity, including repurchases via open-market or privately negotiated transactions, redemptions, exchanges, tender offers or otherwise. We can provide no assurances as to the timing of any such transactions or whether we will complete any such transactions at all. We do not intend to disclose further information regarding any such transactions, except to the extent required in our subsequent periodic filings on Forms 10-K or 10-Q, or unless otherwise required by applicable law. 
 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are summarized as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Changes in Cash: Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 74,837 57,140 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (63,248) (56,573) Net Cash Used in Financing Activities (17,113) (5,136) Effect of exchange rates on cash (4,184) (7,749) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents (9,708) (12,318) 
 
 Operating activities. Our primary sources and uses of cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net income (loss) 91,369 52,874 Non-cash items, net 90,167 88,579 Accounts receivable and contract assets (51,653) (135,237) Inventory (31,819) (23,825) Current liabilities 18,597 61,015 Other changes (41,824) 13,734 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 74,837 57,140 
 
 The decrease in cash related to accounts receivable and contract assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects the timing of project milestones and customer payments. The decrease in cash related to inventory in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to higher activity and related increases in our Manufactured Products and Subsea Robotics inventory. The increase in cash related to current liabilities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects the timing of vendor payments. 
 
 Investing activities. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 63 million in net investing activities, primarily for capital expenditures of 73 million with over half being in our Subsea Robotics segment. Capital expenditures were higher during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 67 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to increased capital expenditures in our OPG segment to extend our capabilities for new contract awards and in our Manufactured Products segment related to our autonomous mobile robotic technology business. These increased capital expenditures were partially offset by lower capital expenditures in our IMDS segment. 
 
 For 2024, we expect our organic capital expenditures to total between 110 million to 130 million, exclusive of business acquisitions, which we expect to fund using our available cash. 
 
 We have several deepwater vessels under a mix of short-term charters where we can see firm workload and spot charters as market opportunities arise. During the second quarter of 2023, we entered into three new long-term charters for deepwater vessels, two of which began in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and the other that began in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, we have three long-term charters that began in 2022. With the current 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 market conditions, we may add additional chartered vessels throughout the year to align with our strategy that balances vessel cost, availability and capability to capture work. We expect to do this through the continued utilization of a mix of short-term, spot and long-term charters. 
 
 Financing activities. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used 17 million and 5.1 million, respectively, of cash in financing activities primarily due to the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately 10 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and payment of tax withholding related to vesting of stock awards. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had long-term debt in the principal amount of 500 million outstanding consisting of our 2028 Senior Notes. We pay interest on the 2028 Senior Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year, and the 2028 Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on February 1, 2028. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase or redeem any of the 2028 Senior Notes. For more on the 2028 Senior Notes, see Note 6 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 215 million of unused commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. For more on our Revolving Credit Facility (including the financial covenants thereunder), see Note 6 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report. 
 
 In December 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase up to 10 million shares of our common stock on a discretionary basis. Under this program, in 2015, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of our common stock for 100 million. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 0.4 million shares for approximately 10 million. We account for the shares we hold in treasury under the cost method, at average cost. The timing and amount of any future repurchases will be determined by our management. We expect that any additional shares repurchased under the plan will be held as treasury stock for possible future use. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any particular number of shares. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, and we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission's rules. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These principles require us to make various estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We disclose our significant accounting policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this quarterly report and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in Part II. Item 7. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 For information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the judgments, assumptions and estimates upon which our critical accounting policies and estimates are based.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we enter into in the normal course of business. These risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of September 30, 2024, we do not believe these risks are material. However, with the expansion of our international operations, we could be exposed to additional market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future. We have not entered into any market-risk-sensitive instruments for speculative or trading purposes. When we have a significant amount of borrowings, we typically manage our exposure to interest rate changes using a combination of fixed- and floating-rate debt. See Note 6 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report for a description of our revolving credit agreement and interest rates on our borrowings. We believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near-term impact on our future earnings or cash flows. 
 
 Because we operate in various regions in the world, we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the United States U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our international operations is the applicable local currency. A stronger U.S. dollar against the United Kingdom pound sterling, the Norwegian kroner and the Brazilian real could result in lower operating income. We manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates by primarily denominating our contracts and providing for collections from our customers in U.S. dollars or freely convertible currency and endeavoring to match our contract costs with the denominated contractual currency. We use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities when the functional currency is the local currency, resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We recorded net adjustments to our equity accounts of 13 million and (11) million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (14) million and (10) million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Negative adjustments reflect the net impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies for locations where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Conversely, positive adjustments reflect the effect of a weakening U.S. dollar. 
 
 Foreign currency gains (losses) of 0.4 million and 0.9 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3.7 million and (3.6) million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded foreign currency transaction gains (losses) as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in those respective periods. 
 
 To mitigate our currency exposure risk in Angola, we have used kwanza to purchase equivalent Angolan central bank (Banco Nacional de Angola) bonds. These bonds are denominated as U.S. dollar equivalents, so that, upon payment of semi-annual interest and principal upon maturity, payment will be made in kwanza, equivalent to the respective U.S. dollars at the then-current exchange rate. In the third quarter of 2024, we purchased 7.0 million of U.S. dollar equivalent Angolan bonds. These bonds mature in February 2031. Because we intend to sell the bonds if we are able to repatriate the proceeds, we have classified these bonds as available-for-sale securities, and they are recorded at fair market value in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. We did not sell any of our Angolan bonds in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We estimated the fair market value of the Angolan bonds to be 7.0 million as of September 30, 2024, using quoted market prices. Since the market for the Angolan bonds was not an active market, the fair value of the Angolan bonds was classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 6.2 million of U.S. dollar equivalent Angolan bonds that were classified as available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair market value in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These bonds matured on September 1, 2023, and we received cash proceeds of 6.2 million.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
