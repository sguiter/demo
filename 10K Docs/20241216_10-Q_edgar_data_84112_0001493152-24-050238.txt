Marketable
securities that are classified as equity securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded
as an unrealized gain or (loss) in the statements of income in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of a marketable security,
the Company records a realized gain or (loss) on the Company s statements of income. 

The
Company evaluates all marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, which are defined as when the cost basis
exceeds the fair value for approximately one year. The Company also evaluates the nature of the investment, cause of impairment and number
of investments that are in an unrealized position. When an other-than-temporary decline is identified, the Company will
decrease the cost of the marketable security to the new fair value and recognize a real loss. The investments are periodically evaluated
to determine if impairment changes are required. As a result of this standard, there were no impairment losses recorded for either of
the quarter or the six months ended October 31, 2024, while management recorded an impairment loss of for the quarter and six-month
period ended October 31, 2023. 

The
Company s investments are actively traded in the stock and bond markets. Therefore, either a realized gain or loss is recorded
when a sale happens. For the quarter ended October 31, 2024 the Company had sales of equity securities which yielded gross realized gains
of and gross realized losses of . For the same period, sales of debt securities did not yield any gross realized gains,
but gross realized losses of were recorded. As for the six-months ended October 31, 2024 the Company had sales of equity securities
which yielded gross realized gains of and gross realized losses of . For the same six-month period, sales of debt securities
did not yield any gross realized gains, but gross realized losses of were recorded. During the quarter ending October 31, 2023,
the Company recorded gross realized gains and losses on equity securities of and , respectively, while sales of debt
securities did not yield any gross realized gains, but gross realized losses of were recorded. During the six-months ending October
31, 2023, the Company recorded gross realized gains and losses on equity securities of and , respectively, while sales
of debt securities did not yield any gross realized gains, but gross realized losses of were recorded. The gross realized loss
numbers include the impaired figures listed in the previous paragraph. 

The
following table shows the investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired ,

Municipal
Bonds 

The
unrealized losses on the Company s investments in municipal bonds were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms
of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because
the Company has the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider
these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024. 

Marketable
Equity Securities and REITs 

The
Company s investments in marketable equity securities and REITs consist of a wide variety of companies. Investments in these companies
include growth, growth income, and foreign investment objectives. The individual holdings have been evaluated, and due to management s
plan to hold on to these investments for an extended period, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily
impaired at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION 

 AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which are subject
to the safe harbor created by those sections. Any statements herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed
to be forward-looking statements. For example, words such as may, will, could, would, 
 should, anticipate, expect, intend, believe, estimate, 
 project or continue, and the negatives of such terms are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
The information included herein represents our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing. Unless required by law, we undertake
no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the attached condensed financial statements, and with the Company s audited
financial statements and discussion for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024. 

Executive
Summary 

The
Company s performance remained steady through the first half of the current fiscal year with the second quarter showing a decrease
in sales over the first quarter of the current fiscal year. This is mainly due to not having a few vital raw materials that are needed
to complete the manufacture of our products. Also, management is not seeing as many high dollar orders as there were in the first quarter
This is because production has caught up on back orders and, since we are tied to the housing market, there almost always is a decline
from the first to second quarter and inflation is still very high. As far as overall company performance, the net income is up when comparing
the current six-month period to the prior six-month period. Management continues to keep manufacturing and operating expenses in check
and the current year realized and unrealized gains on investments have increased over the same periods last year. Opportunities include
keeping up with the business growth, finding ways to get our products out to our customers in a timelier manner, which includes looking
into more automation, and to continue looking at businesses that might be a good fit to purchase. We also continue to work on new products
that will be fit for our industry and business. Challenges in the coming months include continuing to get product out to customers in
a timely manner and dealing with ongoing effects of inflation. Management continues to work at keeping operations flowing as efficient
as possible with the hopes of getting the facilities running leaner and more profitable than ever before. 

Results
of Operations 

Net
 sales were 5,613,000 for the quarter ended October 31, 2024, which is a 7.27 decrease from the corresponding quarter last year.
 Year-to-date net sales were 11,394,000 at October 31, 2024, which is a 5.69 increase from the same period last year. The decrease
 in sales in the current quarter is a result of the business getting caught up on back orders and seeing the lingering results of
 inflation having smaller orders coming in. But management believes the ongoing commitment towards outstanding customer service and
 customization of products are just a few of the many reasons sales continue to grow. 

20 

Cost
 of goods sold was 51.65 of net sales for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 and was 48.72 for the same quarter last year. Year-to-date
 cost of goods sold percentages were 50.33 for the current six months and 50.19 for the corresponding six months last year. The
 current cost of goods sold percentage goals of keeping labor and other manufacturing expenses at less than 50 are just slightly
 over for the quarter and year-to-date results. The increased cost of goods sold percentages are a result of increased wages and some
 increased material costs as management continues to work on finding ways to be more efficient. 

Operating
 expenses were up 95,000 for the quarter and were up 188,000 for the six-months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to the corresponding
 periods last year. When comparing percentages in relation to net sales, the operating expenses for the quarter ended October 31,
 2024 was 21.93 of net sales while it was 18.77 of net sales for the same quarter the prior year. For year-to-date numbers, operating
 expense were 21.09 and 20.55 of net sales for the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has been
 able to keep the operating expenses at less than 25 of net sales for many years now; however, the actual dollar amount increase
 is because of increased commission amounts (since sales have increased) and additional labor costs for wage increases. 

Income
 from operations for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 was at 1,483,000, which is a 24.64 decrease from the corresponding quarter
 last year, which had income from operations of 1,968,000. Income from operations for the six months ended October 31, 2024 was at
 3,256,000, which is a 3.20 increase from the corresponding six months last year, which had income from operations of 3,155,000. 

Other
 income and expenses are up when comparing the current quarter to the same quarter of the prior year, with an increase of 3,273,000
 in the current quarter. Comparably, other income and expenses are up by 3,375,000 when comparing the current six-month period to
 the prior six-month period. Most of the activity in these accounts consists of investment interest, dividends, real gains or losses
 on sale of investments, and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities. The main reason for the gains in the current quarter
 and year-to-date numbers are the unrealized gain and loss on equity securities numbers. The stock market influences these figures,
 and the current state of the economy has been performing well. 

Overall,
 net income for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 was up 2,270,000, or 4,127.27 , over the same quarter last year. Conversely, net
 income for the six-month period ended October 31, 2024 was up 2,601,000, or 112.16 , over the same period in the prior year. 

Earnings
 per common share for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 were 0.45 per share and 1.00 per share for the year-to-date numbers. EPS
 for the quarter and six months ended October 31, 2023 were 0.01) per share and 0.47 per share, respectively.

Liquidity
and capital resources 

Operating 

Net
 cash decreased 1,658,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to a decrease of 1,381,000 during the corresponding
 period last year. 

Accounts
 receivable increased 19,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared with a 553,000 increase for the same period last
 year. The smaller current year increase is a result of improved collection on accounts receivable. An analysis of accounts receivable
 shows that 6.69 of the receivables were over 90 days at October 31, 2024, while 6.71 were over 90 days for the same period last
 year. 

Inventories
 decreased 435,000 during the current six-month period compared to a 1,103,000 increase last year. The decrease in the current year
 is primarily due to fewer purchases of raw materials compared to the prior six-month period. 

Prepaid
 expenses and other current assets increased 21,000 for the current six months, primarily due to increased prepayments on inventory
 during the current six-month period. The prior year six months showed a 608,000 decrease in prepaid expenses. 

The
 federal solar tax credit receivable represents the remaining federal solar tax credits we will receive from our purchase of transferrable
 tax credits, pursuant to transferability provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 

Accounts
 payable decreased 33,000 for the current six-month period compared to a decrease of 323,000 for the prior six-month period. The
 company strives to pay all invoices within terms, and the variance is primarily due to the timing of receipt of products and payment
 of invoices. 

The
 federal solar tax credit payment payable represents the remaining liability for the purchase of transferrable tax credits. This amount
 was paid in November 2024. 

The
 deferred gain on solar tax credit represents the portion of the gain on the purchase of federal solar tax credits that has not yet
 been recognized. This will be recognized as more of the federal solar tax credits are applied to income tax payable. 

Accrued
 expenses decreased 29,000 for the current six-month period compared to a 72,000 decrease for the six-month period ended October
 31, 2023. The difference in the amounts is primarily due to timing issues. 

Income
 tax payable increased 65,000 for the current six-month period, compared to having a decrease of 25,000 in income tax receivable
 for the six-months ended October 31, 2023. The current year income tax payable increase is a result of increased income. 

Investing 

As
 for our investment activities, the Company purchased 308,000 of property and equipment during the current six-month period. In comparison,
 243,000 was spent on purchases of property and equipment during the corresponding six months last year. 

The
 Company continues to purchase marketable securities, which include municipal bonds and quality stocks. During the six-month period
 ended October 31, 2024 there was quite a bit of buy/sell activity in the investment accounts. Net cash used to purchase marketable
 securities for the six-month period ended October 31, 2024 was 361,000 compared to 273,000 cash used in the prior six-month period.
 We continue to use money manager accounts for most stock transactions. By doing this, the Company gives an independent
 third-party firm, who are experts in this field, permission to buy and sell stocks at will. The Company pays a quarterly service
 fee based on the value of the investments. 

22 

The
 Company received a cash distribution of 269,000 from the investment in the limited land partnership during the six-month period
 ending October 31, 2024. This was the second distribution received from the sale of the limited land partnership and the rest of
 the proceeds are contingent on finishing wetland restoration of the land. 

Financing 

The
 Company continues to purchase back its common stock when the opportunity arises. For the six-month period ended October 31, 2024,
 the Company did not purchase any treasury stock, compared to 41,000 repurchased in the corresponding six-month period last year. 

The
 company declared a dividend of 1.00 per share of common stock on September 30, 2024, which was paid out during the second quarter.
 This is an increase to the dividend of 0.65, which was declared and paid during the second fiscal quarter last year. 

New
Product Development 

The
Company and its engineering department continue to develop enhancements to product lines, develop new products that complement existing
products, and look for products that are well suited to our distribution network and manufacturing capabilities. Items currently in various
stages of the development process include: 

Explosion
 proof contacts that will be UL listed for hazardous locations are in development. There has been demand from our customers for this
 type of high security magnetic reed switch. 

The
 Company is developing magnetic contacts which are listed under UL 634 Level 2. These sensors are for high security applications such
 as government buildings, military use, nuclear facilities, and financial institutions. 

Research
 is being done on updating our small profile glass break detector, in addition to looking at the development of programmable temperature
 and humidity sensors with built-in hysteresis. An expansion of the GR3045 panic switch is in the works to include single pull, double
 throw (SPDT) versions, latching, and non-latching with LED indicator lights. A miniature profile overhead door contact based on the
 popular 4532 is also in development. 

Wireless
 technology is a main area of focus for product development. We are considering adding wireless technology to some of our current
 products. A wireless contact switch is in the final stages of development. Also, we are working on wireless versions of monitoring
 devices which include glass break detection, tilt sensing and environmental monitoring. A redesign of our brass water valve shut-off
 system is near completion. 

Other
Information 

In
addition to researching and developing new products, management is always open to the possibility of acquiring a business or product
line that would complement our existing operations. Due to the Company s strong cash position, management believes this could be
achieved without the need for outside financing. The intent is to utilize the equipment, marketing techniques and established customers
to deliver new products and increase sales and profits. 

There
are no known seasonal trends with any of GRI s products since we sell to distributors and OEM manufacturers. Our products are tied
to the housing industry and will fluctuate with building trends.

Not

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (also working as our chief financial officer),
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of October 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures employed at the Company were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

In
our annual report filed on Report 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024, management identified the following material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting: 

The
 small size of our Company limits our ability to achieve the desired level of separation of duties for proper internal controls and
 financial reporting, particularly as it relates to financial reporting to assure material disclosures or implementation of newly
 issued accounting standards are included. We have hired a Controller, and a secondary review of annual and quarterly filings does
 occur with an outside CPA. However, the current CEO and CFO roles are being fulfilled by the same individual and we do not have an
 audit committee. We do not believe we have met the full requirement for separation of duties for financial reporting purposes. 

Despite
the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our financial statements included in this report fairly present
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all material respects. 

We
are committed to the establishment of effective internal controls over financial reporting and will place emphasis on quarterly and year-end
closing procedures, timely documentation, and internal review of accounting and financial reporting consequences of material contracts
and agreements, and enhanced review of all schedules and account analyses by experienced accounting department personnel or independent
consultants. 

We
will continue to follow the standards for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for internal control over financial
reporting to include procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail that fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of management and the Board of Directors; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than those mentioned above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October
31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
