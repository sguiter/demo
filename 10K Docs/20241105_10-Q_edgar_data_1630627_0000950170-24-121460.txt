These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate, and management's beliefs and assumptions, and are not guarantees of future performance or development and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors many of which are beyond our control. As a result, any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report may turn out to be inaccurate. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and this Quarterly Report under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. 
 These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to this Quarterly Report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

TREACE MEDICAL CONCEPTS, INC. 
 Notes to Condensed Financial Statements 
 (unaudited) 
 , as a Florida limited liability company. Effective July 1, 2014, the entity converted to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (the "Company"). The Company is a medical technology company with the goal of advancing the standard of care for the surgical management of bunion and related midfoot deformities. The Company received 510(k) clearance for the Lapiplasty System in March 2015 and began selling its surgical medical devices in September 2015. The Company has pioneered the proprietary Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System a combination of instruments, implants and surgical methods designed to surgically correct all three planes of the bunion deformity and secure the unstable joint, addressing the root cause of the bunion. In addition, the Company offers advanced instrumentation and implants for use in other procedures performed in high frequency with bunion surgery. The Company operates from its corporate headquarters located in Ponte Vedra, Florida. Initial Public Offering and Follow-on Offering On April 27, 2021, the Company completed its initial public offering ("IPO"). The Company received net proceeds of million from the IPO. O n February 10, 2023, the Company completed a follow-on offering that resulted in net proceeds of million. Acquisition of RedPoint Medical3D On June 12, 2023 (the "closing date"), the Company acquired certain assets of MIOS Marketing, LLC d/b/a RedPoint Medical3D ("RPM-3D"), a medical technology company offering pre-operative planning and patient-specific guides designed to deliver accurate surgical correction of deformities tailored to the patient's unique foot anatomy. RPM-3D's 22 patent applications further expanded and reinforced the Company's global intellectual property portfolio covering technologies for the correction of bunion and related deformities. The Company paid million in exchange for certain assets used in providing pre-operative planning and patient-specific guides for the surgical correction of foot and ankle deformities and agreed to make additional payments upon completion of certain milestones. The original terms are as follows: million upon completion of certain transition services at 12 months from the closing date, million upon completion of certain technological advancements milestone within 12 months of the closing date, and, subject to prior completion of the transition services and the technological advancements milestone, up to million upon the issuance of certain patent claims. Payments made for the transition services and patent claims require satisfaction of such milestones, as well as the continued service of key individuals. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company and RPM-3D evaluated the status of the milestones and amended the original terms associated with the milestone payments. The maximum amount to be paid upon the achievement of the milestone payments has been reduced from million to million and is subject to successful completion of the transition services milestone at the first anniversary date of the acquisition. Upon successful completion of the transition services milestone, the payments were scheduled as follows: million on July 15, 2024 million for the transition services milestone and million for the technological advancements milestone) and million on January 15, 2025 million for the technological advancements milestone and million for the patent milestone). milestone payments would have been made if the transition services milestone was not achieved by the acquisition anniversary date. The Company paid RPM-3D million on July 15, 2024 upon completion of the transition services milestone.

() 

Fair value as of September 30, 2024 

Contingent consideration is included in other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the balance was classified as current due to the timing of the expected payment. The change in fair value for the contingent consideration related to the technological advancements milestone payment was classified as research and development expense within the Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company renegotiated with RPM-3D the terms for payment of the technological advancements milestone that was initially accounted for as contingent consideration. The renegotiated contract specifies that the technological advancements milestone payment will not be paid unless the transition services milestone is achieved. The technological advancements milestone payment is now tied to the continued service of key individuals from the date of the new contract until the transition services milestone determination date (which is the first anniversary date of the acquisition). Therefore, the Company is no longer accounting for the technological advancements milestone payment as contingent consideration at fair value, but rather as research and development expense over the remaining service period. The Company expects to pay the full amount for the technological advancements milestone of million, of which million was paid on July 15, 2024 and the remaining million will be paid on January 15, 2025. See Note 1, "Formation and Business of the Company" of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition of RPM-3D. There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

MidCap Loan and Revolving Loan Facility On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into a million loan facility with entities affiliated with MidCap Financial Trust ("MidCap"), providing up to million in a term loan facility and a million revolving loan facility. The term loan facility provides for a 60-month term loan up to million in borrowing capacity to the Company, over four tranches. At term loan closing, the Company drew million under tranche one. At September 30, 2024, there is one tranche available for million, subject to the achievement of certain revenue targets. The revolving loan facility provides up to million in borrowing capacity to the Company based on the borrowing base. The borrowing base is calculated based on certain accounts receivable and inventory assets. On September 30, 2024, the borrowing base allows a total of million available to the Company under the revolving loan facility. The balance drawn as of September 30, 2024 is million under the revolving loan facility. The Company may request an increase in the revolving loan facility up to million for a total commitment of up to million. of the revolving borrowing capacity or (ii) of the borrowing base, or the Company is in default, MidCap will apply funds collected from the Company's lockbox account to reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving loan facility ("Lockbox Deductions"). As of September 30, 2024, the Company's borrowing level has not activated the Lockbox Deductions, nor is it expected to for the next 12 months; therefore, the Company has determined that the revolving loan balance is long-term debt.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report") and our audited financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 27, 2024 (our "Annual Report"). This discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our Annual Report under "Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors," and in the section titled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report . Please also see the section of this Quarterly Report titled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
 Overview 
 We are a medical technology company with the goal of advancing the standard of care for the surgical management of bunion and related midfoot deformities. We have pioneered our proprietary Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System a combination of instruments, implants and surgical methods designed to surgically correct all three planes of the bunion deformity and secure the unstable joint, addressing the root cause of the bunion and helping patients get back to their active lifestyles. Although bunions are deformities typically caused by an unstable joint in the middle of the foot that leads to a three-dimensional ("3D") misalignment in the foot's anatomical structure, the majority of traditional surgical approaches focus on correcting the deformity from a two-dimensional ("2D") perspective and therefore fail to address the root cause of the disorder. To effectively restore the normal anatomy of bunion patients and improve clinical outcomes, we believe addressing the root cause of the bunion is critical and have developed the Lapiplasty System to correct the deformity across all three anatomic dimensions. Our other products often used in conjunction with bunion surgery include the Adductoplasty System, the Hammertoe PEEK Fixation System, the SpeedPlate Rapid Compression Implant System, and specialized osteotomes and release instruments. In addition, we recently announced our entrance into the metatarsal osteotomy segment with the Nanoplasty Procedure, which allows for a 3D correction of the bunion through a cosmetically appealing, hidden incision on the side of the foot. With the Lapiplasty and Nanoplasty Procedures and other new products, we are continuing to execute our strategy of becoming a comprehensive bunion solutions company and supporting further penetration into the bunion market opportunity. See the Innovation and Growth section below for more information on our new products. 
 We were formed in 2013, and since receiving 510(k) clearance for the Lapiplasty System in March 2015, we have sold more than 100,000 Lapiplasty Procedure kits in the United States. We market and sell our Lapiplasty Systems to physicians, surgeons, ambulatory surgery centers and hospitals. The Lapiplasty Procedure can be performed in either hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery centers settings, and utilizes existing, well-established reimbursement codes. We currently market and sell the Lapiplasty System and other products through a combination of a direct employee sales force and independent sales agencies across the United States. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 12.1 million and marketable securities of 70.7 million available for sale to fund operations, an accumulated deficit of 189.5 million and 54.0 million of principal outstanding under our term loan and revolving loan agreements. 
 Economic Environment 
 There is continuing uncertainty in the macro-economic environment. Inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, recession fears and reduced consumer confidence may continue to result, in higher costs and potentially reduced demand for our procedure kits and other products. General economic conditions may also negatively impact demand for elective surgeries. While we continuously work with suppliers to mitigate higher costs and longer lead times and continue to invest in our direct sales channel, patient education initiatives, clinical evidence and product innovations to build demand for our products, we expect these macro-economic challenges to continue for the foreseeable future, which likely will impact our results of operations. 
 Factors Affecting Our Business 
 We believe that our financial performance has been and in the foreseeable future, will continue to depend on many factors, including the macro-economic conditions as described above, those noted in our Annual Report, in the section titled "Special 
 16 

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and in the section titled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Increased Competition 
 Before we launched our flagship Lapiplasty system, there were no other products in the market that provided a 3D solution and specialized procedural instrumentation for these traditionally freehand, difficult Lapidus surgeries, which allowed us to capitalize on our pioneering technology and grow our market share quickly. We are experiencing increased competition from the accelerating adoption of minimally invasive osteotomy solutions and from new Lapidus products, which has, and may continue to, negatively impact our growth rates and market share. 
 Innovation and Growth 
 We expect to continue to focus on long-term revenue growth through investments in our business and new products. In sales and marketing, we have dedicated meaningful resources and believe that we have built a sales force and management team that can support our future growth as well as our patient focused outreach and education campaigns. 
 In research and development, our team and surgeon consultants are continually working on next-generation innovations for the surgical correction of bunions and other conditions that often present with bunions. In 2023, in addition to the acquisition of the assets of RPM-3D, we began the market release of (1) the SpeedPlate fixation platform, which can be used in the Lapiplasty and Adductoplasty Procedures, as well as other common bone fusion procedures of the foot, (2) the Hammertoe PEEK Fixation System designed to address hammertoe, claw toe and mallet toe deformities, which often present concomitantly with bunions, and (3) LapiTome and RazorTome Osteotomes, which are sterile, single-use instruments that are designed to facilitate more efficient removal and release of bone slices and soft tissue in Lapiplasty and Adductoplasty cases. 
 We expect to introduce new products on a steady cadence through 2025, including launching the limited market releases of the following new products during the fourth quarter of 2024 or soon thereafter: (1) the Nanoplasty system, a minimally invasive 3D osteotomy system, (2) IntelliGuide PSI Cut Guides for Lapiplasty and Adductoplasty procedures, which are cut guides created specifically for an individual patient s foot anatomy, (3) expanded SpeedPlate configurations designed to address additional fusion procedures throughout the foot, (4) the Micro-Lapiplasty system, which is designed to allow the Lapiplasty Procedure to be performed through a minimally-invasive 2cm incision; and (5) the Mini-Adductoplasty System, which is designed to allow the Adductoplasty midfoot correction procedure to be performed through an approximately 50 smaller incision. 
 Intellectual Property Strategy 
 We actively seek to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that we consider important to our business using patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights in the United States and foreign markets. As of September 30. 2024, our patent portfolio included 65 granted U.S. patents, with an additional 24 granted patents worldwide and over 100 pending patent applications. In keeping with our strategy of protecting our intellectual property rights, on October 14, 2024, we filed a lawsuit against Stryker Corporation ("Stryker") and its subsidiary Wright Medical Technology, Inc. alleging infringement of 9 patents related to our innovative Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction technologies and unfair competition. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, and seeks injunctive relief and damages. 
 Adoption of the Lapiplasty System and other products 
 The growth of our business depends on our ability to gain broader acceptance of the Lapiplasty System as well as our other existing products and the new systems that we intend to introduce by successfully marketing and distributing these products. While surgeon adoption of the Lapiplasty Procedure and our other products and procedures remains critical to supporting procedure growth, hospital and ambulatory surgery center facility approvals are necessary for both existing and future surgeon customers to access our products. To facilitate greater access to our products and support future sales growth, we intend to continue educating hospitals and facility administrators on the differentiated benefits associated with the Lapiplasty System as well as new systems we plan to introduce, supported by our robust portfolio of clinical data on our existing procedures and additional clinical data we expect to develop on our new products. If we are unable to successfully continue to commercialize our Lapiplasty System and to successfully introduce new products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. In the near term, we expect we will continue to operate at a loss, and we anticipate we will finance our operations principally through the use of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and expected revenues. We may also raise funds by incurring debt and through offerings of our capital stock. 
 17 

Seasonality 
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business, with higher sales volumes in the fourth calendar quarter, historically accounting for approximately 30 to 40 of full year revenues, and lower sales volumes in the subsequent first calendar quarter. Our sales volumes in the fourth quarter tend to be higher as many patients elect to have surgery after meeting their annual deductible and having time to recover over the winter holidays. Our sales volumes in subsequent first calendar quarters also tend to be lower versus the prior year fourth quarters as a result of adverse weather and by resetting annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay elective procedures; however, in some years the first quarter may benefit from additional sales volumes when high patient demand for surgeries in the fourth quarter cannot be fully accommodated and those surgical procedures are rolled over into the first quarter. Similar to the rest of the orthopaedic industry, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as elective procedures generally decline during the summer months. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and surgeons that purchase or use our products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse for all or part of the costs and fees associated with procedures using our products. As a result, sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the procedures using our products are covered by third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Based on historical claims data from 2017, approximately 63 of Lapidus cases and 60 of all bunion surgical cases were paid by private payors. 
 Medicare payment rates to hospital outpatient departments are set under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system, which groups clinically similar hospital outpatient procedures and services with similar costs to ambulatory payment classifications ("APCs"). Each APC is assigned a single lump sum payment rate, which includes payment for the primary procedure as well as any integral, ancillary, and adjunctive services. The primary current procedure terminology ("CPT") codes for the Lapiplasty Procedure, CPT 28297 and CPT 28740, are grouped together under APC 5114. For Lapiplasty Procedures in which fusion is performed on multiple tarsometatarsal ("TMT") joints, CPT 28730 applies and is classified under APC 5115. For Adductoplasty Procedures in which fusion is performed on multiple TMT joints, either CPT 28730 or CPT 27835 applies and are classified under APC 5115. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We currently generate revenue from the sale of our proprietary Lapiplasty System and the minimally invasive variations, Adductoplasty System, Hammertoe PEEK Fixation System, SpeedPlate Implant Fixation Platform, single use osteotomes and release instruments, and other ancillary products. These systems bring together single-use implant kits, reusable instrument trays, and surgical techniques. We sell the kits and single use instruments and other products to physicians, surgeons, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers in the United States through a network of employee sales representatives and independent sales agencies. 
 No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect our revenue to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future as we expand our product offerings, sales territories, new accounts and trained physician base and as existing physician customers perform more Lapiplasty and other procedures using our products, though it may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including seasonality, the macro-economic environment and competition. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs for the purchase of our products from third-party manufacturers. Direct costs from our third-party manufacturers include costs for raw materials plus the markup for the assembly of the components. Cost of goods sold also includes royalties, allocated overhead for indirect labor, certain direct costs such as those incurred for shipping our products, sterilization, packaging, and personnel costs. We expense all inventory provisions for excess, obsolete and field losses as cost of goods sold. We record adjustments to our inventory valuation for estimated excess, obsolete and non-sellable inventories based on assumptions about future demand, past usage, changes to manufacturing processes and overall market conditions. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future to the extent more of our products are sold, though it may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 
 18 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 We calculate gross profit as revenue less cost of goods sold, and gross margin as gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily average selling prices, production, and ordering volumes, change in mix of customers, third-party manufacturing costs and cost-reduction strategies. We expect our gross profit to increase in the foreseeable future as our revenue grows, though our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in average selling prices as we introduce new products, and as we adopt new manufacturing processes and technologies. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, sales commissions and share-based compensation, related to selling and marketing functions, surgical instrument expense, physician education programs, training, shipping costs related to sending products to our sales representatives, travel expenses, marketing initiatives including our direct-to-patient outreach program and advertising, market research and analysis and conferences and trade shows. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development ("R D") expenses consist primarily of engineering, product development, clinical studies to develop and support our products, regulatory expenses, and other costs associated with products and technologies that are in development. These expenses include compensation for personnel, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation, supplies, consulting, prototyping, testing, materials, travel expenses, depreciation, and an allocation of facility overhead expenses. We expect R D expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future as we continue to hire personnel and invest in next-generation innovations of the Lapiplasty System and other products, though it may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including the level and timing of our new product development efforts, as well as our clinical development, clinical studies and other related activities. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for personnel, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and share-based compensation, related to finance, information technology, legal and human resource functions, as well as professional services fees (including legal, audit and tax fees), insurance costs, general corporate expenses and allocated facilities-related expenses. We have the infrastructure and personnel in place to support the growth of our organization. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest received on our money market funds and marketable securities. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest incurred and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to outstanding borrowings.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Before our IPO, our primary sources of capital were private placements of common stock and convertible preferred stock, debt financing agreements and revenue from the sale of our products. In April 2021, we received net proceeds of 107.6 million from our IPO. On February 10, 2023, we received net proceeds of 107.5 million from a follow-on public offering of our common stock. 
 21 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 12.1 million and marketable securities of 70.7 million available for sale, an accumulated deficit of 189.5 million and 54.0 million principal outstanding under the term and revolving loans with MidCap. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and available debt borrowings and expected revenues will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least twelve months from the issuance of our condensed financial statements. We may be required or decide to raise additional debt or equity financing to support further growth of our operations. 
 Funding Requirements 
 We use our cash, marketable securities, and revenues to fund our operations, which primarily include the costs of manufacturing our Lapiplasty, Adductoplasty, SpeedPlate, and other products, as well as our sales and marketing, R D, and general and administrative expenses. We expect R D expenses to increase as we continue to hire personnel and invest in next-generation innovations of our existing products and new products. The timing and amount of our operating and capital expenditures will depend on many factors, including: 
 the scope and timing of our investment in our commercial infrastructure and sales force; 

the costs of our ongoing commercialization activities including product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution; 

the scope of our marketing efforts, including the degree to which we utilize direct to consumer campaigns; 

the degree and rate of market acceptance of the Lapiplasty System and our other products; 

the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including enforcing our intellectual property rights against infringing products or technologies or enforcing contractual rights against parties breaching agreements with us, including the litigation proceeding we initiated against Stryker; 

our need to implement additional infrastructure and internal systems; 

the research and development activities we intend to undertake in order to improve the Lapiplasty System and other products, to commercialize PSI technologies, to gain share in the minimally invasive osteotomy market, and to develop or acquire additional products; 

the investments we make in acquiring other technologies, assets or businesses to expand our product portfolio; 

the success or emergence of new competing technologies or other adverse market developments; 

the effect of inflation, interest rate changes, and other general economic conditions on our operations and business; 

any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products; 

the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

the costs associated with being a public company; and 

the impact of any infectious disease outbreak or natural or other disaster or event beyond our control on our business or on the healthcare industry, particularly elective surgeries where our products are used. 

Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and available debt borrowings will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or that may change in the future, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities or a combination of one or more of these or other funding sources. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we could be forced to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts, sales and marketing initiatives, or other operations. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, is likely to involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and, in the event of 
 22 

insolvency, debt holders would be repaid before holders of our equity securities received any distribution of our corporate assets.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.0 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of 55.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 30.6 million and an increase in net operating assets. The non-cash charges consist primarily of share-based compensation expense of 22.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 6.2 million, and provision for allowance for credit losses of 2.4 million primarily due to a significant customer that filed for bankruptcy. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to an increase of 14.4 million in inventories to meet demand for new products and a decrease of 12.8 million in accrued liabilities due to timing of payments, and an increase of 0.3 million in other non-current assets, partially offset by a 11.5 million decrease in accounts receivable from higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.8 million in accounts payable due to timing of payments, and a 0.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 35.1 million, consisting primarily of a net loss of 43.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 16.4 million and an increase in net operating assets. The non-cash charges consist primarily of share-based compensation expense of 11.5 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 3.6 million and non-cash lease expense of 1.9 million, partially offset by amortization and accretion of marketable securities of 1.0 million. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to an increase of 9.9 million in inventories for added safety stock to meet demand for new products and to avoid potential supply chain issues, an increase of 1.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets (excluding unsettled securities transactions) and a decrease of 2.0 million in accrued liabilities, which were partially offset by a 4.1 million decrease in accounts receivable from higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a 0.5 million increase to operating lease liabilities primarily due to timing of lease incentives. The decrease of 2.0 million in accrued liabilities consisted of a decrease of 3.8 million due to timing of payments, offset by an increase of 1.8 million due to increased accrued compensation expense related to our acquisition of RPM-3D in the second quarter 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 32.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of 93.4 million in sales and maturities of available for sale marketable securities, partially offset by 52.9 million in purchases of available for sale marketable securities and 8.5 million in purchases of property and equipment. The net of marketable securities sales and maturities and purchases of 40.5 million were primarily used to fund our current operations. The purchases in property and equipment included 6.7 million in capitalized surgical instruments for the reusable instrument trays related to new products, and 1.8 million for equipment and leasehold improvements to support the growth of our business. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 86.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of 140.1 million in purchases of marketable securities available for sale, 20.0 million for the acquisition of the RPM-3D assets, and 9.2 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 83.0 million in sales and maturities of marketable securities available for sale. The purchases of marketable securities were the result of cash invested from our public offering of common stock during the first quarter of 2023. The purchases in property and equipment were 3.6 million in capitalized surgical instruments for our reusable instrument trays and 5.6 million for furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements to continue to complete our new corporate headquarters. 
 23 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of 0.4 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by 0.2 million of shares repurchased for tax withholding on vested RSUs. 
 Net cash provided in financing activities was 109.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of 107.5 million of net cash proceeds from our public offering of common stock and 1.7 million from exercise of stock options. 
 Royalty Agreements 
 We recognized royalty expense of 1.4 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 4.6 million and 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate royalty rate was 3.2 and 3.8 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate royalty rate was 3.3 and 3.8 , respectively. Each of the royalty agreements with our surgeon consultants prohibits the payment of royalties on products sold to entities and/or individuals with whom any of the surgeon advisors is affiliated. 
 Operating Lease 
 We have commitments for future payments related to our corporate headquarters office located in Ponte Vedra, Florida. We entered into a 10-year lease in February 2022 for our headquarters which expires in July 2032. Lease payments comprise the base rent plus operating costs which includes taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance. We also have commitments for future payments related to our former headquarters which expire in April 2026. We have obtained subleases for this space. The remaining lease obligations are 24.3 million under these leases as of September 30, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. 
 Goodwill 
 Our annual impairment testing date is July 1, 2024. We determined after performing the qualitative analysis that there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying amount. Therefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 goodwill was 12.8 million. 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Annual Report. There had been no material changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate and credit risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity. Since our investments may be used to fund operations, we performed sensitivity testing which measures the impact on the fair market value of the investments if a hypothetical 50 basis points increase and decrease in interest rates occurred. The interest rate risk analysis assumes using an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates. 
 The following table presents our estimate of the impact on fair value based on the scenario discussed above (in thousands): 

September 30, 2024 

Change in fair value 

Fair value of marketable securities 
 
 Down 50 bps 
 
 Up 50 bps 

78,464 
 
 162 
 
 165) 

Under our current outstanding debt terms, we do not have a risk to rising interest rates as the interest rates are capped at 9 for the term debt and 7 for the revolving loan facility. If a 194-basis point decrease in the 30-day forward looking secured overnight financing rate occurred, we would start to experience a reduction in our interest rate expense from current levels. 
 Credit Risk 
 We manage our credit risk within the available-for-sale securities portfolio by maintaining a well-diversified investment portfolio that limits the investments to certain types of investments, such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities, money market funds, commercial paper, Yankee CDs, and high credit quality asset-backed securities and corporate debt securities. In addition, the overall portfolio requires a maximum portfolio duration of one year. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent limitation on the effectiveness of internal control 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur 
 25 

because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 26 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not a party to any legal proceedings which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. 
 On October 14, 2024, we filed a lawsuit against Stryker Corporation and its subsidiary Wright Medical Technology, Inc. alleging infringement of 9 patents related to our innovative Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction technologies and unfair competition. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, and seeks injunctive relief and damages. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under "Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors" for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.
