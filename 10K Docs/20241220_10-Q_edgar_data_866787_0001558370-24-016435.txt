An allowance for credit losses was deemed unnecessary given consideration of the factors above. The Company did not realize any material gains or losses on its marketable debt securities during the twelve week period ended November 23, 2024, and the comparable prior year period.

The Revolving Credit Agreement includes (i) a million sublimit for swingline loans, (ii) a million individual issuer letter of credit sublimit and (iii) a million aggregate sublimit for all letters of credit.

Since its fiscal year end, the Company has canceled, issued and modified stand-by letters of credit that are primarily renewed on an annual basis to cover deductible payments to its casualty insurance carriers. As of November 23, 2024, the million commercial paper borrowings, the million Senior Notes due April 2025 and the million Senior Notes due April 2025 were classified as long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company currently has the ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis through available capacity under its Revolving Credit Agreement. As of November 23, 2024, the Company had billion of availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement, without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings, which would allow it to replace these short-term obligations with a long-term financing facility. The Senior Notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if the Company experiences both a change of control and a rating event (both as defined in the agreements). The Company s borrowings under its Senior Notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. All of the repayment obligations under its borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. Interest for the Senior Notes is paid on a semi-annual basis. The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated at billion as of November 23, 2024, and billion as of August 31, 2024, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available to the Company for debt of the same terms (Level 2). Such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by million and greater than the carrying value of debt by million at November 23, 2024, and August 31, 2024, respectively, which reflects their face amount, adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of AutoZone, Inc. Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of AutoZone, Inc. (the Company) as of November 23, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the twelve week periods ended November 23, 2024 and November 18, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the condensed consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of August 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated October 28, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ Ernst Young LLP Memphis, Tennessee December 20, 2024

 Operating results for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 30, 2025. Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 or 17 weeks. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 has 16 weeks, and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 had 17 weeks. Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales generally occurring during the months of February through September, and the lowest sales generally occurring in the months of December and January. Executive Summary Net sales increased to 4.3 billion, a 2.1 increase over the prior year period. Our retail and commercial sales in our domestic and international markets grew as we continue to make progress on our growth initiatives. Operating profit decreased 0.9 to 841.1 million. Operating profit was negatively impacted 17.0 million due to unfavorable exchange rates. Net income decreased 4.8 to 564.9 million and diluted earnings per share decreased 0.1 to 32.52. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 86 of total sales, which is consistent with the comparable prior year period. Failure related categories continue to be the largest portion of our sales mix. We did not experience any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to the previous year. Our sales mix can be impacted by weather over a short-term period. Over the long-term, we believe the impact of weather on our sales mix is not significant. Our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumers and our industry, including but not limited to inflation, interest rates, levels of consumer debt, fuel and energy costs, prevailing wage rates, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, tariffs and trade policies, hiring and other economic conditions. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future. The two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. For the 12-month period ended in September 2024, miles driven in the U.S. increased 1.1 compared to the same period in the prior year, based on the latest information available from the U.S. Department of Transportation. According to S P Global Mobility, as of January 1, 2024, the average age of light vehicles on the road was 12.6 years. Twelve Weeks Ended November 23, 2024 Compared with Twelve Weeks Ended November 18, 2023 Net sales for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, increased 89.4 million to 4.3 billion, or 2.1 over net sales for the comparable prior year period. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in total company same store sales of 1.8 on a constant currency basis and net sales of 71.9 million from new domestic and international stores. Domestic commercial sales increased 35.3 million to 1.1 billion, or 3.2 over the comparable prior year period.

 (1) Constant currency same store sales exclude impacts from fluctuations of foreign exchange rates by converting both the current year and prior year international results at the prior year foreign currency exchange rate. 
 Gross profit for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, was 2.3 billion, compared with 2.2 billion during the comparable prior year period. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 53.0 compared to 52.8 during the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by higher merchandise margins. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, and the comparable prior year period were 1.4 billion. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were 33.3 compared with 32.6 during the comparable prior year period. Net interest expense for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, was 107.6 million compared to 91.4 million during the comparable prior year period. Average borrowings were 8.9 billion and 8.1 billion, and weighted average borrowing rates were 4.43 and 4.23 for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, and November 18, 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, was 23.0 of pretax income compared to 21.6 for the comparable prior year period. The benefit from stock options exercised for the twelve week period ended November 23, 2024, was 5.3 million compared to 11.2 million in the comparable prior year period. Net income for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, decreased by 28.5 million from the comparable prior year period to 564.9 million due to the factors set forth above, and diluted earnings per share decreased by 0.1 to 32.52 from 32.55. The impact on current quarter diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases since the end of the comparable prior year period was an increase of 0.22. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products and accessories. We believe that our cash generated from operating activities and available credit, supplemented with our long-term borrowings will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As of November 23, 2024, we held 304.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as 2.2 billion in undrawn capacity on our Revolving Credit Agreement, before giving effect to commercial paper borrowings. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business, repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the short-term and long-term. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. However, decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns would negatively impact our ability to generate cash from operating activities. Decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreements and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Agreement. In the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. All of our material borrowing arrangements are described in greater detail in Note H Financing in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 For the twelve week periods ended November 23, 2024, and November 18, 2023, our net cash flows from operating activities provided 811.8 million and 830.3 million, respectively. Our net cash flows used in investing activities for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, were 265.7 million as compared with 270.5 million in the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, were 247.0 million compared to 235.4 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by our growth initiatives, including new stores, and hub and mega hub store expansion projects. During the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, and November 18, 2023, we opened 34 and 25 net new stores, respectively. Investing cash flows were impacted by our wholly owned captive, which purchased 12.3 million and 4.1 million, and sold 12.6 million and 1.9 million in marketable debt securities during the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024 and the comparable prior year period, respectively. Our investment in tax credit equity investments was 31.0 million during the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, compared to 41.2 million during the comparable prior year period. Our net cash flows used in financing activities for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, were 538.1 million compared to 552.2 million in the comparable prior year period. During the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, we had no debt issuances compared to 1.0 billion in debt issuances received in the comparable prior year period . Stock repurchases were 540.1 million in the current twelve week period as compared with 1.5 billion in the comparable prior year period. The treasury stock repurchases were primarily funded by cash flows from operations. For the twelve week period ended November 23, 2024, and the comparable prior year period, we had 15.0 million and 76.9 million in net repayments of commercial paper, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of common stock and exercises of stock options for the twelve weeks ended November 23, 2024, and November 18, 2023, provided 36.0 million and 41.4 million, respectively. During fiscal 2025, we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2024. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our growth initiatives, which include new stores, new distribution centers, and hub and mega hub store expansion projects. The amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors, including whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment) and whether such buildings are located in the U.S., Mexico or Brazil, or located in urban or rural areas. In addition to the building and land costs, our new stores require working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our suppliers ability to factor their receivables from us. The Company has arrangements with third-party financial institutions to confirm invoice balances owed by the Company to certain suppliers and pay the financial institutions the confirmed amounts on the invoice due dates. These arrangements allow the Company s inventory suppliers, at their sole discretion, to enter into agreements with these financial institutions to finance the Company s obligations to the suppliers at terms negotiated between the suppliers and the financial institutions. Supplier participation is optional and our obligations to our suppliers, including the amount and dates due, are not impacted by our suppliers decision to enter into an agreement with a third-party financial institution. A downgrade in our credit or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions and our suppliers willingness to participate in these arrangements; however, we do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows. We plan to continue negotiating extended terms with our suppliers, benefitting our working capital and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 119.5 at November 23, 2024, and 124.4 at November 18, 2023. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing based on our current credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.

 For the trailing four quarters ended November 23, 2024, our adjusted after-tax return on invested capital ROIC ), which is a non-GAAP measure, was 47.7 as compared to 55.0 for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted ROIC is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). We use adjusted ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for further details of our calculation. Our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense EBITDAR ratio as of November 23, 2024, and November 18, 2023, was 2.5:1. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, financing lease liabilities and rent times six; and we calculate EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and share-based compensation expense to net income. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is calculated on a trailing four quarter basis. We target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. We believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. To the extent EBITDAR increases, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if EBITDAR decreases, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for further details of our calculation. Debt Facilities On November 15, 2024, we amended the Revolving Credit Agreement, extending the termination date by one year. As amended, the Revolving credit agreement will terminate, and all amounts borrowed will be due and payable, on November 15, 2028. The Senior Notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience both a change of control and a rating event (both as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our Senior Notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. As of November 23, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements. See Note H Financing in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning our revolving credit agreement, outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds commitment and Senior Notes. Stock Repurchases See Note I Stock Repurchase Program in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our share repurchases. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted After-Tax ROIC and Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors. Additionally, our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our underlying operating results and the Compensation Committee of the Board uses select measures to determine payments of performance-based compensation against pre-established targets. Adjusted After-Tax ROIC and Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR provide additional information for determining our optimal capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note A in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our critical accounting estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2024. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk At November 23, 2024, the only material change to our instruments and positions that are sensitive to market risk since the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2024 was the 15.0 million net decrease in commercial paper. The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated at 8.9 billion as of November 23, 2024, and 9.0 billion as of August 31, 2024, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available to the Company for debt of the same terms (Level 2). Such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by 120.8 million and greater than the carrying value of debt by 3.5 million at November 23, 2024, and August 31, 2024, respectively, which reflects their face amount, adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. We had 565.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding at November 23, 2024, and 580.0 million in variable rate debt outstanding at August 31, 2024. At these borrowing levels for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows of 5.7 million in fiscal 2025. The primary interest rate exposure is based on the federal funds rate. We had outstanding fixed rate debt of 8.4 billion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 52.5 million at November 23, 2024, and 8.4 billion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 55.6 million at August 31, 2024. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our fixed rate debt by 344.5 million at November 23, 2024. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of November 23, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 23, 2024. Changes in Internal Controls There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 23, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings As of the date of this filing, there have been no additional material legal proceedings or material developments in the legal proceedings disclosed in Part 1, Item 3, of our Annual Report in Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024.
