USE
OF MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes market and industry data that we have obtained from third-party sources, including industry publications,
as well as industry data prepared by our management on the basis of its knowledge of and experience in the industries in which we operate
(including our management s estimates and assumptions relating to such industries based on that knowledge). Management has developed
its knowledge of such industries through its experience and participation in these industries. While our management believes the third-party
sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are reliable, neither we nor our management have independently verified any
of the data from such sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied
upon by such sources. Furthermore, internally prepared and third-party market prospective information, in particular, are estimates only
and there will usually be differences between the prospective and actual results, because events and circumstances frequently do not
occur as expected, and those differences may be material. Also, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to any publications,
reports, surveys or articles prepared by third parties should not be construed as depicting the complete findings of the entire publication,
report, survey or article. The information in any such publication, report, survey or article is not incorporated by reference in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Solely
for convenience, we refer to trademarks in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q without the or the or symbols, but such references
are not intended to indicate that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our own trademarks. Other
service marks, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, if any, are the property of their respective
owners, although for presentational convenience we may not use the or the symbols to identify such trademarks.

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
These statements relate to future events including, without limitation, the terms, timing and closing of our proposed acquisitions or
our future financial performance. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using terminology such as anticipates, 
 believes, expects, can, continue, could, estimates, 
 expects, intends, may, plans, potential, predict, 
 should or will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only
predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are as of the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed, and
we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed to confirm
these statements to actual results, unless required by law. 

You
should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
identify important factors which you should consider in evaluating our forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other
things: 

Our
 ability to effectively execute our business plan; 

Our
 ability to manage our expansion, growth and operating expenses; 

Our
 ability to protect our brands and reputation; 

Our
 ability to repay our debts; 

Our
 ability to rely on third-party suppliers outside of the United States; 

Our
 ability to evaluate and measure our business, prospects and performance metrics; 

Our
 ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry; 

Our
 ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and customer behavior; 

Risks
 in connection with completed or potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic growth opportunities and initiatives; 

Risks
 related to the anticipated timing of the closing of any potential acquisitions; and 

Risks
 related to the integration with regards to potential or completed acquisitions. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market
size and growth and other industry data. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give
undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties
and contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though we do
generally believe the data to be reliable. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future
performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of
factors. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including,
but not limited to, the possibility that we may fail to preserve our expertise in consumer product development; that existing and potential
distribution partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products or
pricing terms; that we may be unable to maintain or grow sources of revenue; that we may be unable maintain profitability; that we may
be unable to attract and retain key personnel; or that we may not be able to effectively manage, or to increase, our relationships with
customers; that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially
from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

Step
4 Allocate the Transaction Price After the transaction price has been determined, the next step is to allocate the transaction
price to each performance obligation in the contract. If the contract only has one performance obligation, the entire transaction price
will be applied to that obligation. If the contract has multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance
obligations based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) at contract inception. 

Step
5 Satisfaction of the Performance Obligations (and Recognize Revenue) Revenue is recognized when (or as) goods or services
are transferred to a customer. The Company satisfies each of its performance obligations by transferring control of the promised good
or service underlying that performance obligation to the customer. Control is the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially
all of the remaining benefits from an asset. It includes the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of and obtaining
the benefits from an asset. Indicators that control has passed to the customer include: a present obligation to pay; physical possession
of the asset; legal title; risks and rewards of ownership; and acceptance of the asset(s). Performance obligations can be satisfied at
a point in time or over time. 

Substantially
all of the Company s revenues continue to be recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which is upon
shipment of the finished goods to the customer. All sales have fixed pricing and there are currently no material variable components
included in the Company s revenue. Additionally, the Company will issue credits for defective merchandise, historically these credits
for defective merchandise have not been material. Based on the Company s analysis of the new revenue standards, revenue recognition
from the sale of finished goods to customers, which represents substantially all of the Company s revenues, was not impacted by
the adoption of the new revenue standards.

Fair
value estimates are based on a series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
Management values property, plant and equipment using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes
consideration of obsolescence. Management values acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method,
forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The significant assumptions used to estimate the
value of the acquired intangible assets include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of future cash flows (such
as revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). Real properties are marked to fair value for valuation of the
total purchase price. For certain items, the carrying value is determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information

NOTE E ACQUISITION OF GOe3, LLC (cont d) 

Acquisitions 

Upon acquisition of a business, the Company uses the
income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate. The valuation inputs in these models and
analyses are based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 

Fair value estimates are based on a series of judgments
about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Management values property, plant and equipment using
the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes consideration of obsolescence. Management values
acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, forms of the income approach supported by observable
market data for peer companies. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the acquired intangible assets include discount
rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of future cash flows (such as revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty
rates). Real properties are marked to fair value for valuation of the total purchase price. For certain items, the carrying value is determined
to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to the Company.

Conversion
Rights. 

(a)
Automatic Conversion. Each Class B Share shall (subject to receipt of any and all necessary approvals) convert automatically into one
fully paid and non-assessable Class A Share (i) upon its sale, gift, or other transfer to a party other than a Principal Stockholder
(as defined below) or an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder (as defined below), (ii) upon the death of the Class B Stockholder holding
such Class B Share, unless the Class B Shares are transferred by operation of law to a Principal Stockholder or an Affiliate of a Principal
Stockholder, or (iii) in the event of a sale, gift, or other transfer of a Class B Share to an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder,
upon the death of the transferor. Each of the foregoing automatic conversion events shall be referred to hereinafter as an Event
of Automatic Conversion. For purposes of this ARTICLE FIVE, Principal Stockholder includes any of Donald H. Goldman,
Steven M. Fieldman, Lance Fieldman, Yuri Itkis, Michall Itkis and Boris Itkis and an Affiliate of a Principal Stockholder 
is a person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the person specified. For purposes of this definition, control, when used with respect to any specified person, means
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Without limitation, an Affiliate also includes the estate of such individual. 

(b)
Voluntary Conversion. Each Class B Share shall be convertible at the option of the holder, for no additional consideration, into one
fully paid and non-assessable Class A Share at any time. 

(c)
Conversion Procedure. Promptly upon the occurrence of an Event of Automatic Conversion such that Class B shares are converted automatically
into Class A Shares, or upon the voluntary conversion by the holder, the holder of such shares shall surrender the certificate or certificates
therefor, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer
agent for the Class A Shares, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office (i) stating that the shares are being converted

as provided in subparagraph 5.6(b) hereof, (ii) specifying the Event of Automatic Conversion (and, if the occurrence of such event is
within the control of the transferor, stating the transferor s intent to effect an Event of Automatic Conversion) or whether such
conversion is voluntary, (iii) identifying the number of Class B Shares being converted, and (iv) setting out the name or names (with
addresses) and denominations in which the certificate or certificates for Class A Shares shall be issued and including instructions for
delivery thereof. Delivery of such notice together with the certificates representing the Class B Shares shall obligate the Corporation
to issue such Class A Shares and the Corporation shall be justified in relying upon the information and the certification contained in
such notice and shall not be liable for the result of any inaccuracy with respect thereto. Thereupon, the Corporation or its transfer

to this subparagraph (c) (each date being the Conversion Date ). The person entitled to receive the Class A Shares issuable
upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such Class A Shares at and as of the Conversion Date,

sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements. 

In
performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate
the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources that may include establishing corporate partnerships,
establishing licensing revenue agreements, issuing additional convertible debentures and issuing public or private equity securities,
including selling common stock through an at-the-market facility (ATM). 

There
is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will
be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations
or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore,
have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available
on attractive terms or they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing shareholders. We have therefore
concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from our failure to continue as a going concern.

is aware. 

The Company

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, management performed, with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,
as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Due
to resource constraints, material weaknesses are evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure
for inclusion in our filings with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, which is due to the lack of resources and segregation of duties.
We lack sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in GAAP to meet the demands for a public
company, including the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the requirements of GAAP-based reporting. This weakness
causes us to not fully identify and resolve accounting and disclosure issues that could lead to a failure to perform timely internal
control and reviews. In addition, the Company has not established an audit committee, does not have any independent outside directors
on the Company s Board of Directors, and lacks documentation of its internal control processes. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change to our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during the period ended September 30, 2024
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, our
Board is currently seeking to improve our controls and procedures to remediate the deficiency described above.
