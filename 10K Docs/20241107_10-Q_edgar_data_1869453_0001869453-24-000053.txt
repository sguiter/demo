CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Blue Owl Technology Income Corp. (the Company, we or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies; 
 an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 
 the impact of elevated interest and inflation rates, ongoing supply chain and labor market disruptions, including those as a result of strikes, work stoppages or accidents, instability in the U.S. and international banking systems, uncertainties related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and the risk of recession or a shutdown of government could impact our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
 an economic downturn could also impact availability and pricing of our financing and our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets; 
 a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our lending and investment activities; 
 changes in base interest rates and significant market volatility on our business and our portfolio companies (including our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies including the ability to achieve our and their business objectives), our industry and the global economy including as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions; 
 interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly because we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 
 currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 
 our future operating results; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 
 competition with other entities and our affiliates for investment opportunities; 
 risks related to the uncertainty of the value of our portfolio investments, particularly those having no liquid trading market; 
 the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments as well as any estimates regarding potential use of leverage; 
 the adequacy of our financing sources and working capital; 
 the loss of key personnel; 
 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 
 the ability of Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors II LLC the Adviser or our Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the ability of the Adviser to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
 our ability to qualify for and maintain our tax treatment as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act 
 the impact that environmental, social and governance matters could have on our brand and reputation and our portfolio companies; 
 the effect of legal, tax and regulatory changes; 
 the impact of information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks, and the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology; 
 the impact of geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the escalated conflict in the Middle-East, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, and general uncertainty surrounding the financial and political stability of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and China, on financial market volatility, global economic markets, and various markets for commodities globally such as oil and natural gas; and 
 other risks, uncertainties and other factors previously identified in the reports and other documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 Discounts to par value on securities purchased are accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. Premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized to first call date. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion or amortization of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. If at any point the Company believes PIK interest is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest income. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

 Dealer Manager Agreement 
 The Company has entered into a dealer manager agreement (the Dealer Manager Agreement with Blue Owl Securities, an affiliate of the Adviser, and participating broker-dealer agreements with certain broker-dealers. Under the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement and the participating broker-dealer agreements, Blue Owl Securities serves as the dealer manager, and certain participating broker- dealers solicit capital, for the Company s public offering of shares of Class S, Class D, and Class I common stock. Blue Owl Securities will not receive upfront selling commissions with respect to purchases of Class S, Class D and Class I shares or shares of any class of shares issued pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. 
 Subject to FINRA limitations on underwriting compensation and pursuant to a distribution plan adopted by the Company in compliance with Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under the 1940 Act, as if those rules applied to the Company, the Company will pay Blue Owl Securities servicing fees for ongoing services rendered to shareholders by participating broker-dealers or broker-dealers servicing investors accounts, referred to as servicing broker-dealers: 
 With respect to the Company s outstanding Class S shares equal to per annum of the aggregate net asset value of the Company`s outstanding Class S shares; and

 The fair value of the Company s performing Level 3 debt investments is typically determined utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to its total enterprise value, and the rights and remedies of the Company s investment within the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 When the debtor is not performing or when there is insufficient value to cover the investment, the Company may utilize a net recovery approach to determine the fair value of debt investments in subject companies. A net recovery analysis typically consists of two steps. First, the total enterprise value for the subject company is estimated using standard valuation approaches, most commonly the market approach. Second, the fair value for each investment in the subject company is then estimated by allocating the subject company s total enterprise value to the outstanding securities in the capital structure based upon various factors, including seniority, preferences, and other features if deemed relevant to each security in the capital structure. 
 Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 debt investments primarily include current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. For the Company s Level 3 equity investments, a market approach, based on comparable financial performance multiples such as publicly-traded company and comparable market transaction multiples of revenues, EBITDA, or some combination thereof and comparable market transactions typically would be used. 
 Debt Not Carried at Fair Value 
 Fair value is estimated by discounting remaining payments using applicable current market rates, which take into account changes in the Company s marketplace credit ratings, or market quotes, if available.

 (1) The per share data was derived using the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. 
 (2) The amount shown at this caption is the balancing amount derived from the other figures in the schedule. The amount shown at this caption for a share outstanding throughout the period may not agree with the change in the aggregate gains and losses in portfolio securities for the period because of the timing of sales of the Company s shares in relation to fluctuating market values for the portfolio.

 (4) Total return is not annualized. An investment in the Company is subject to maximum upfront sales load of and for Class S and Class D common stock, respectively, of the offering price, which will reduce the amount of capital available for investment. Class I common stock is not subject to upfront sales load. Total return displayed is net of all fees, including all operating expenses such as management fees, incentive fees, general and administrative expenses, organization and amortized offering expenses, and interest expenses. Total return is calculated as the change in net asset value NAV per share (assuming dividends and distributions, if any, are reinvested in accordance with the Company s dividend reinvestment plan), if any, divided by the beginning NAV per share (which for the purposes of this calculation is equal to the net offering price in effect at that time). 
 (5) Operating expenses may vary in the future based on the amount of capital raised, the Adviser s election to continue expense support, and other unpredictable variables. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total operating expenses to average net assets were , , for Class S, Class D and Class I common stock, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the total operating expenses to average net assets were , , for Class S, Class D and Class I common stock, respectively.

 Overview 
 Blue Owl Technology Income Corp. (the Company , we , us , or our is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). Formed as a Maryland corporation on June 22, 2021, we were advised by Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors LLC OTCA from October 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021. As of November 30, 2021, we are advised by Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors II LLC (our Adviser or OTCA II ). The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. On December 9, 2021, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Tech Lending IC LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Tech Lending IC LLC makes loans to borrowers headquarter in California. From time to time we may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate the normal course of business. 
 We are managed by our Adviser. Our Adviser is an indirect affiliate of Blue Owl Capital Inc. Blue Owl (NYSE: OWL) and part of Blue Owl s Credit platform, which focuses on direct lending. Our Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services, to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. Our Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 We rely on an exemptive order issued to an affiliate of the Adviser that permits us to offer multiple classes of shares of common stock and to impose asset-based servicing and distribution fees and early withdrawal fees. We are offering on a best efforts, continuous basis up to 5,000,000,000 in any combination of amount of shares of Class S, Class D, and Class I common stock. The share classes have different upfront selling commissions and ongoing servicing fees. Each class of common stock will be offered through Blue Owl Securities LLC (d/b/a Blue Owl Securities) (the Dealer Manager ). No upfront selling commission, dealer manager fees, or other similar placement fees will be paid to us or the Dealer Manager with respect to the Class S and Class D shares, however, if such Class S shares or Class D shares are purchased through certain financial intermediaries, those financial intermediaries may directly charge transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, in such amount as they may determine, provided that the selling agents limit such charges to 3.50 of the net offering price per share for each Class S share and 1.50 of the net offering price per share for each Class D share. Class I shares are not subject to upfront selling commissions. Class S, Class D and Class I shares will be offered at initial purchase prices per share of 10.00. Thereafter, the purchase price per share for each class of common stock will vary and will not be sold at a price below our net asset value per share of such class, as determined in accordance with our share pricing policy, plus applicable upfront selling commissions. 
 On September 30, 2021, an affiliate of the Adviser the Initial Shareholder purchased 100 shares of our Class I common stock at 10.00 per share, which represents the initial public offering price of such shares. The Initial Shareholder will not tender these shares for repurchase as long as the Adviser remains our investment adviser. There is no current intention for the Adviser to discontinue its role. On October 6, 2021, we received a subscription agreement, totaling 50.0 million for the purchase of Class I common shares of our common stock from entities affiliated with the Adviser. We had called all of the 50.0 million under the subscription agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 Since meeting the minimum offering requirement and commencing our continuous public offering through September 30, 2024, we have issued 65,266,805 shares of Class S common stock, 2,689,500 shares of Class D common stock, and 27,897,420 shares of Class I common stock, exclusive of any tender offers and shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, for gross proceeds of 671.8 million, 27.4 million, and 284.9 million, respectively, including 1,000 of seed capital contributed by its Initial Shareholder. We have issued 196,998,884 shares of our Class I common stock to feeder vehicles primarily created to hold our Class I shares in a Private Offering and raised gross proceeds of approximately 2.0 billion. 
 Our Adviser also serves as investment adviser to Blue Owl Technology Finance Corp. II. 
 Blue Owl consists of three investment platforms: (1) Credit, which focuses on direct lending, (2) GP Strategic Capital, which focuses on acquiring equity positions in and providing debt financing to institutional alternative asset managers and (3) Real Estate, which focuses on triple net lease real estate strategies and real estate credit. Blue Owl s Credit platform is comprised of the Adviser, OTCA, Blue Owl Credit Advisors LLC OCA ), Blue Owl Diversified Credit Advisors LLC ODCA ), and Blue Owl Credit Private Fund Advisors LLC OPFA 
 80 

and together with the Adviser, OCA, ODCA and OTCA, the Blue Owl Credit Advisers ), which are also investment advisers. As of September 30, 2024, the Adviser and its affiliates had 128.4 billion in assets under management across Blue Owl s Credit platform. 
 The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of the Adviser and the Technology Lending Investment Committee. The Investment Team is also led by Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer and is supported by certain members of the Adviser s senior executive team and Blue Owl s Credit platform s investment committees. Blue Owl s Credit platform has four investment committees each of which focuses on a specific investment strategy (Diversified Lending, Technology Lending, First Lien Lending and Opportunistic Lending). Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz, Craig W. Packer and Alexis Maged sit on each of Blue Owl s Credit platform s investment committees. In addition to Messrs. Ostrover, Lipschultz, Packer and Maged, the Technology Lending Investment Committee is comprised of Erik Bissonnette, Pravin Vazirani and Jon ten Oever. We consider the individuals on the Technology Lending Investment Committee to be our portfolio managers. The Investment Team, under the Technology Lending Investment Committee s supervision, sources investment opportunities, conducts research, performs due diligence on potential investments, structures our investments and will monitor our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. 
 The Technology Lending Investment Committee meets regularly to consider our investments, direct our strategic initiatives and supervise the actions taken by the Adviser on our behalf. In addition, the Technology Lending Investment Committee reviews and determines whether to make prospective investments (including approving parameters or guidelines pursuant to which investments in broadly syndicated loans may be bought and sold), structures financings and monitors the performance of the investment portfolio. Each investment opportunity requires the approval of a majority of the Technology Lending Investment Committee. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies may require the Technology Lending Investment Committee s approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the portfolio company was made. In addition, temporary investments, such as those in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, may require approval by the Technology Lending Investment Committee. The compensation packages of certain Technology Lending Investment Committee members from the Adviser include various combinations of discretionary bonuses and variable incentive compensation based primarily on performance for services provided and may include shares of Blue Owl. 
 In addition, we and the Adviser have entered into a dealer manager agreement with Blue Owl Securities and certain participating broker-dealers to solicit capital (the Dealer Manager Agreement ). 
 We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We rely on an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the Order ), that has been granted by the SEC to OCA and certain of its affiliates, to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to the Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit our Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Order permits us to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. The Blue Owl Credit Advisers investment allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities over time between us and/or other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the Order, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and investment portfolios of BDCs, private funds and separately managed accounts managed by the Blue Owl Credit Advisers (collectively, the Blue Owl Credit Clients and/or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the Order and have an investment objective similar to ours. 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and have elected to be regulated as a RIC for tax purposes under the Code. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as: 
 the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets , as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; 
 source of income limitations; 
 asset diversification requirements; and 
 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least the sum of 90 of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on originating and making debt and equity investments in technology-related (specifically software) companies based primarily in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of September 30, 2024, 99.0 of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly. 
 Our investment portfolio may consist of floating rate loans. Macro trends in base interest rates like SOFR, and any other alternative reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally intend to originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments may vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, may often be idiosyncratic, and may reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends. Generally, because our portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, we expect our earnings to benefit from a prolonged higher rate environment. 
 Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. 
 Dividend income on equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies. 
 Our portfolio activity may also reflect the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, performance based incentive fee, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement, legal and professional fees and other operating expenses. The management fee and performance based incentive fee compensate our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments. 
 83 

Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear our allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs). We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement; and (iii) all other expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to: 
 expenses deemed to be organization and offering expenses for purposes of Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (exclusive of commissions, the dealer manager fee, any discounts and other similar expenses paid by investors at the time of sale of our stock); 
 the cost of corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of shares of our common stock; 
 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 
 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; 
 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; 
 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 
 costs of hedging; 
 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 
 escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; 
 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 
 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; 
 federal, state and local taxes; 
 independent directors fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; 
 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; 
 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs); 
 the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 
 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 
 research and market data; 
 fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 
 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 
 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; 
 costs of winding up; 
 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; 
 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and 
 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. 
 We expect, but cannot assure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 On November 30, 2021, we entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser, the purpose of which was to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders represented a return of capital for tax purposes. The Expense Support Agreement became effective as of the date that we met the minimum offering requirement, and was terminated by the Adviser on March 7, 2023. 
 On a quarterly basis, the Adviser reimbursed us for Operating Expenses (as defined below) in an amount equal to the excess of our cumulative distributions paid to our shareholders in each quarter over Available Operating Funds (as defined below) received by us on account of our investment portfolio during such quarter. Any payments that the Adviser was required to make pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to herein as an Expense Payment . 
 Under the Expense Support Agreement, Operating Expenses was defined as all of our operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies. Available Operating Funds was defined as the sum of (i) our estimated investment company taxable income (including realized net short-term capital gains reduced by realized net long-term capital losses), (ii) our realized net capital gains (including the excess of realized net long-term capital gains over realized net short- 
 84 

term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies, if any (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). 
 Following any quarter in which Available Operating Funds exceed the cumulative distributions paid by us in respect of such quarter (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), we are required to pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, in accordance with the stipulations below, as applicable, to our Adviser, until such time as all Expense Payments made by our Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such quarter have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by us are referred to as a Reimbursement Payment . 
 Our obligation to make Reimbursement Payments survives the termination of the Expense Support Agreement. There are no Reimbursement Payments conditionally due from us to the Adviser. 
 Expense Deferral Agreement 
 On March 23, 2022, we entered into the expense deferral agreement (the Expense Deferral Agreement with the Adviser, under which the Adviser has agreed to incur and pay all of our expenses, other than amounts used to pay interest expense and shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, until we met certain conditions related to amount of subscriptions it received. The expenses subject to deferral did not include expenses that (1) were previously classified as Expense Payments or Reimbursement Payments under the Expense Support Agreement, or (2) Organization and Offering Expenses in excess of 1.50 of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of our securities. 
 On May 9, 2023, the Company and the Adviser amended the Expense Deferral Agreement to provide that the Adviser's obligation to incur and pay the Company s expenses would cease as of April 30, 2023, and that the Company would repay the expenses previously incurred by the Adviser on the Company s behalf in eighteen equal installments, upon meeting specified conditions. The first installment became an obligation of the Company on December 1, 2023, when the Company reached 1.75 billion in Net Subscriptions received from the sale of the Company s common shares, and each of the seventeen remaining installments will become an obligation of the Company for each 75.0 million in Net Subscriptions received from the sale of the Company s common shares thereafter. The Company recorded 2.0 million and 8.7 million of expenses, of which 0.6 million and 2.5 million related to organization and offering costs, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 The Expense Deferral Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by us or the Adviser, with or without notice, and will automatically terminate (i) in the event of the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, or (ii) if the Board makes a determination to dissolve or liquidate us. However, our obligation to repay the Adviser the expenses incurred by the Adviser on our behalf upon meeting the specified conditions will survive any termination of the agreement. 
 Fee Waivers 
 On March 23, 2022, the Adviser agreed to waive 100 of the base management fee through October 31, 2022. Any portion of the base management fee waived will not be subject to recoupment. 
 On June 22, 2022, the Adviser agreed to waive 100 of the performance based incentive fee and capital gains based incentive fee through October 31, 2022. Any portion of the incentive fees waived will not be subject to recoupment. 
 Reimbursement of Administrative Services 
 We will reimburse our Adviser for the administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. However, such reimbursement will be made at an amount equal to the lower of our Adviser s actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. Also, such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. We will not reimburse our Adviser for any services for which it receives a separate fee, for example rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of our Adviser. 
 Leverage 
 The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. On September 30, 2021, we received shareholder approval that allowed us to reduce our asset coverage ratio from 200 to 150 , effective as of October 1, 2021. As a result, we generally are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to the common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least be equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. This reduced asset coverage ratio permits us to double the amount of leverage we can incur. For example, under a 150 asset coverage ratio we may borrow 2 for investment purposes of every 1 of investor equity whereas under a 200 asset coverage ratio we may only borrow 1 for investment purposes for every 1 of investor equity. Our current target leverage ratio is 0.90x-1.25x. 
 In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities.

Potential Market Trends 
 We believe the technology investment lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate an attractive total return based on a combination of the following factors: 
 Limited Availability of Capital for Technology, Specifically Enterprise Software, Companies. We believe that technology companies have limited access to capital, driven by a lack of dedicated pools of capital focused on technology companies and a reduction in activity from commercial and investment banks as a result of regulatory and structural factors, industry consolidation and general risk aversion. Traditional lenders, such as commercial and investment banks, generally do not have flexible product offerings that meet the needs of technology-related companies. In recent years, many commercial and investment banks have focused their efforts and resources on lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to technology-related companies. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold loans and high yield securities, as well as their ability to provide equity financing, as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of scaled market participants that are willing to provide and hold meaningful amounts of a customized financing solution for technology companies. As a result, we believe our focus on technology-related companies and our ability to invest across the capital structure, coupled with a limited supply of capital providers, presents an attractive opportunity to invest in technology companies. 
 Capital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void Left by Banks . Access to the underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets is challenging for many technology companies due to loan size and liquidity. For example. high yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds ETFs who, among other things, are highly focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities initial investment decision. 
 Syndicated loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and tenor, otherwise known as flex , to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis. In addition, our Adviser has teams focused on both liquid credit and private credit and these teams are able to collaborate with respect to syndicated loans. 
 Secular Trends Supporting Growth for Private Credit. According to Gartner, a research and advisory company, global technology spend was 4.7 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to more than 5.1 trillion in 2024. We believe global demand for technology products and services will continue to grow rapidly, and that growth will stimulate demand for capital from technology companies which will continue to require access to capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. We believe that periods of market volatility, such as the current period of market volatility caused, in part, by uncertainty regarding inflation and interest rates, and current geopolitical conditions, have accentuated the advantages of private credit. The availability of capital in the liquid credit market is highly sensitive to market conditions whereas we believe private lending has proven to be a stable and reliable source of capital through periods of volatility. We believe the opportunity set for private credit will continue to expand even as the public markets remain open. Financial sponsors and companies today are familiar with direct lending and have seen firsthand the strong value proposition that a private solution can offer. Scale, certainty of execution and flexibility all provide borrowers with a compelling alternative to the syndicated and high yield markets. Based on our experience, there is an emerging trend where higher quality credits that have traditionally been issuers in the syndicated and high yield markets are increasingly seeking private solutions independent of credit market conditions. In our view, this is supported by financial sponsors wanting to work with collaborative financing partners that have scale and breadth of capabilities. We believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms broadly, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be 2.7 trillion as of December 31, 2023, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that technology companies, private equity sponsors, venture capital firms, and entrepreneurs will continue to seek partners to provide flexible financing for their businesses with debt and equity investments provided by companies such as us. 
 Attractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. With respect to the debt investments in technology companies, we believe the directly negotiated nature of such financings generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender protective change of control provisions. Further, we believe that historical default rates for technology and software companies have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the broader leveraged finance market, leading to lower cumulative losses. With respect to equity and equity-linked investments, we will seek to structure these investments with meaningful shareholder protections, including, but not limited to, anti-dilution, anti-layering, and liquidation preferences, which we believe will create the potential for meaningful risk-adjusted long-term capital gains in connection with the future liquidity events of these technology companies. Lastly, we believe that in the current environment, lenders with available capital may be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and may be able to achieve improved economic spreads and documentation terms. 
 Compelling Business Models. We believe that the products and services that technology companies with a focus on enterprise software provide often have high switching costs and are fundamental to the operations and success of their customers. We generally invest in dominant 
 86 

or growing players in niche markets that are selling products to established customer bases. As a result, technology companies with a focus on enterprise software have attributes that make them compelling investments, including strong customer retention rates, and highly recurring and predictable revenue. Further, technology companies with a focus on enterprise software are typically highly capital efficient, with limited capital expenditures and high free cash flow conversion. In addition, the replicable nature of technology products, specifically enterprise software, creates substantial operating leverage which typically results in strong profitability. 
 We believe that enterprise software businesses make compelling investments because they are inherently diversified into a variety of sectors due to end market applications and have been one of the more defensive sectors throughout economic cycles. 
 Attractive Opportunities in Investments in Technology Companies. We invest in the debt and equity of technology companies. We believe that opportunities in the debt of technology companies are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. We believe that debt issued with floating interest rates offers a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer s security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are generally secured by the issuer s assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default. 
 We believe that opportunities in the equity of technology companies are significant because of the potential to generate meaningful capital appreciation by participating in the growth in the portfolio company and the demand for its products and services. Moreover, we believe that the high-growth profile of a technology company will generally make it a more attractive candidate for a liquidity event than a company in a non-high growth industry. We believe the technology investment lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate an attractive total return based on a combination of the foregoing factors 
 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 On March 21, 2022, the Board approved multiple purchase agreements with Macquarie US Trading LLC Macquarie and certain of its affiliates (each, a Financing Provider and collectively, the Financing Providers ). Under the purchase agreements, the Company had forward obligations to settle the purchase of certain investments (the Warehouse Investments from the Financing Providers, each of whom was obligated to settle the sale of such investments subject to the following conditions: (a) the Company received a minimum of 450.0 million of subscriptions; and (b) the Board approved the purchase of the specific Warehouse Investments. As of May 10, 2022, conditions under the purchase agreement were met and we became obligated to settle 129.2 million of funded principal at the end of the respective minimum day count for each warehouse investment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company settled its required obligations under the purchase agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 90.0 first lien senior debt investments (of which 42.4 we consider to be unitranche debt investments (including last out portions of such loans)), 4.2 second lien senior secured debt investments, 1.2 unsecured debt investments, 3.6 , preferred equity investments, 1.0 common equity investments. As of September 30, 2024, our investment in joint ventures is insignificant. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 10.5 and 10.6 , respectively, and our weighted average yield of accruing debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 10.7 and 10.7 , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average spread of total debt investments was 5.3 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 171 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of 5.0 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we had net leverage of 0.70x debt-to-equity. 
 In the current lending environment, public loan markets have remained active while merger and acquisition activity remains below historical levels; however, our platform continues to find attractive investment opportunities for deployment, predominantly in first lien originations. In addition, a large portion of our originations across the platform this quarter were deployed into existing borrowers as part of add-on transactions. 
 The credit quality of our portfolio has been consistent. We continue to focus on investing in industries we view as recession resistant and that we are familiar with, including service-oriented sectors such as software and healthcare, all of which serve diversified and durable end markets. Blue Owl serves as the administrative agent on many of our investments and the majority of our investments are supported by sophisticated financial sponsors who provide operational and financial resources. Our borrowers that we classify as traditional financing, which exclude certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile, have a weighted average EBITDA of 394.7 million and we believe this scale contributes to the durability of our borrowers and their ability to adapt to different economic environments. In addition, Blue Owl continues to invest in, and is often the lead lender or administrative agent on, transactions in excess of 1 billion in size, which gives us the ability to structure the terms of such deals to maximize deal economics and credit protection. 
 Many of the companies in which we invest are continuing to see solid demand with modest growth in both revenues and EBITDA. However, in the event of further geopolitical, economic and financial market instability, in the U.S. and elsewhere, it is possible that the results of some of the middle-market companies similar to those in which we invest could be challenged. While we are not seeing signs of an overall, 
 87 

broad deterioration in our results or those of our portfolio companies at this time, there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our future results. 
 We also continue to invest in Credit SLF and specialty financing portfolio companies, including LSI Financing DAC 1 LSI Financing ). These companies may use our capital to support acquisitions which could continue to lead to increased dividend income across well-diversified underlying portfolios. In the future we may invest through additional specialty finance portfolio companies, joint ventures, partnerships or other special purpose vehicles. See Specialty Financing Portfolio Companies .

 The weighted average yield of our accruing debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders but, rather, relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. 
 Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 
 review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
 An investment will be placed on the Adviser's credit watch list when select events occur and will only be removed from the watch list with oversight of the Technology Lending Investment Committee and/or other Blue Owl agent. Once an investment is on the credit watch list, the Adviser works with the borrower to resolve any financial stress through amendments, waivers or other alternatives. If a borrower defaults on its 
 91 

payment obligations, the Adviser's focus shifts to capital recovery. If an investment needs to be restructured, the Adviser s workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Technology Lending Investment Committee. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser will rate the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. 
 This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 Investment Rating Description 1 Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable; 
 2 Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2; 
 3 Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition; 
 4 Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due); and 
 5 Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 Our Adviser rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 The Adviser has built out its portfolio management team to include workout experts who closely monitor our portfolio companies and who, on at least a quarterly basis, assess each portfolio company s operational and liquidity exposure and outlook to understand and mitigate risks; and, on at least a monthly basis, evaluates existing and newly identified situations where operating results are deviating from expectations. As part of its monitoring process, the Adviser focuses on projected liquidity needs and where warranted, re-underwriting credits and evaluating downside and liquidation scenarios. 
 The Adviser focuses on downside protection by leveraging existing rights available under our credit documents; however, for investments that are significantly underperforming or which may need to be restructured, the Adviser s workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Technology Lending Investment Committee. 
 The table below presents the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of the following periods:

 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interest obtained in connection with originated loans, such as options, warrants, or conversion rights. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income increased by 58.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in our investment portfolio which increased from 2.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 to 5.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns. PIK interest represented approximately 4.2 and 6.5 of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. PIK dividend income represented approximately 3.7 and 4.5 of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other income increased by 0.6 million period-over-period due a increase in incremental fee income, which are fees that are generally available to us as a result of closing investments and generally paid at the time of closing. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments. 
 
 For nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income increased by 165.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in our investment portfolio which increased from 2.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 to 5.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns. PIK interest represented approximately 4.5 and 6.4 of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. PIK dividend income represented approximately 3.8 and 7.3 of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Dividend income increased by 1.9 million period-over-period driven by an increase in our portfolio of dividend income-producing investments. Other income increased by 3.1 million period-over-period due to an increase in incremental fee income, which are fees that are generally available to us as a result of closing investments and generally paid at the time of closing. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments.

 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, we reimburse the Adviser for services performed for us. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total operating expenses, increased by 30.5 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in interest expense, management fees, performance based incentive fees and other expenses of 19.3 million, 4.1 million, 3.9 million, and 3.5 million, respectively. The increase in total operating expense was partially offset by a reversal in the capital gains incentive fees of 0.3 million due to unrealized depreciation on the portfolio. The increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in average daily borrowings to 2.0 billion from 1.1 billion, coupled with an increase in the average interest rate to 8.3 from 8.1 , period over period. The increase in management fees was driven by growth in the net asset value of the portfolio period-over-period. The increase in incentive fees was due to higher pre-incentive fee net investment income. The increase in offering costs, professional fees, director s fees and other general and administrative expenses was driven by an amendment to the Expense Deferral Agreement period over period. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total operating expenses, increased by 85.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in interest expense, management fees, performance based incentive fees and other expenses of 48.0 million, 10.2 million, 11.3 million, and 16.0 million, respectively. The increase in total operating expenses was partially offset by a reversal in the capital gains incentive fees of 0.5 million due to unrealized depreciation on the portfolio. The increase in interest expenses was driven by an increase in average daily borrowings to 1.7 billion from 1.0 billion, coupled with an increase in the average interest rate to 8.4 from 8.0 period over period. The increase in management fees was driven by growth in the net asset value of the portfolio period-over-period. The increase in incentive fees was due to higher pre-incentive fee net investment income period-over-period. The increase in offering costs, professional fees, director s fees and other general and administrative expenses was driven by an amendment to the Expense Deferral Agreement period over period. 
 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. In addition, a RIC may, in certain cases, satisfy this distribution requirement by distributing dividends relating to a taxable year after the close of such taxable year under the spillover dividend provisions of Subchapter M. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.2 million and 0.4 million of U.S. federal excise tax expenses, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 0.2 million and 0.2 million of U.S. federal excise tax, respectively.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of any offering of our common stock and from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. The primary uses of our cash are for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying or reimbursing our Adviser), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities, enter into additional debt securitization transactions. or issue additional debt securities. Additional financings could include SPV drop down facilities and unsecured notes. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . 
 In addition, from time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange debt securities in open market purchases or by other means, including privately negotiated transactions, in each case dependent on market conditions, liquidity, contractual obligations, and other matters. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 
 97 

2023, our asset coverage ratio was 233.1 and 235.4 , respectively. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitment we are required to fund. Our current target ratio is 0.90x-1.25x. As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average cost of debt was 8.6 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash, taken together with our available debt capacity is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. Our long-term cash needs will include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and funding of additional portfolio investments. Funding for long-term cash need will come from unused net proceeds from financing activities. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term cash requirements. We cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to us in sufficient amounts in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 429.9 million available under our credit facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 91.1 million in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1.6 billion in cash was used for operating activities, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of 2.2 billion offset by sell downs and repayments 0.5 billion of and other operating activity of 0.1 billion. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was 1.6 billion during the period, which was the result of proceeds from gross borrowings on our credit facilities of 2.5 billion, partially offset by repayments on our credit facilities of 1.7 billion, and 1.1 billion of proceeds from issuance of common shares. 
 Net Assets 
 Share Issuances 
 In connection with our formation, we have the authority to issue 3,000,000,000 common shares, 0.01 per share par value, 1,000,000,000 of which are classified as Class S common shares, 1,000,000,000 of which are classified as Class D common shares, and 1,000,000,000 of which are classified as Class I common shares. Pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-260095), we registered 5,000,000,000 in any combination of amount of shares of Class S, Class D, and Class I common stock at an initial public offering price of 10.00 per share. 
 In certain cases, and subject to the Dealer Manager s approval, the shares of holders of Class S or Class D shares may be converted or exchanged into an equivalent net asset value amount of Class I shares, including in situations where a shareholder exits a relationship with a participating broker-dealer for this offering and does not enter into a new relationship with a participating broker-dealer for this offering. 
 On September 30, 2021, we issued 100 common shares for 1,000 to OTCA, an affiliate of the Adviser. 
 On October 6, 2021, we received a subscription agreement totaling 50 million for the purchase of shares of our Class I common stock from entities affiliated with the Adviser. As of December 31, 2022, we had called all 50 million of the commitment pursuant to the subscription agreement and commenced our continuous public offering. 
 OTCA will not tender the Class I shares it purchased on September 30, 2021 for repurchase as long as our Adviser remains the investment adviser of the Company. There is no current intention for our Adviser to discontinue its role.

We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan which was amended and restated on May 6, 2024. The amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan provides for reinvestment of any cash distributions on behalf of shareholders who have enrolled in the distribution reinvestment plan. As a result, if the Board authorizes and declares a cash distribution, then the shareholders who have enrolled in the distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. We expect to use newly issued shares to implement the distribution reinvestment plan. 
 We may fund our cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to us, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to us on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from the Adviser, which is subject to recoupment. In no event, however, will funds be advanced or borrowed for the purpose of distributions, if the amount of such distributions would exceed our accrued and received revenues for the previous four quarters, less paid and accrued operating expenses with respect to such revenues and costs. Prior to the termination of the Expense Support Agreement on March 7, 2023, a portion of the Company's distributions resulted from expense support from the Adviser. The purpose of this arrangement was to avoid distributions being characterized as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. 
 The tables below presents the source of cash distributions on a U.S. GAAP basis that the Company has declared on its shares of common stock for the following periods:

 Share Repurchases 
 The Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will engage in any share repurchase, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of our Board, we may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of our investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. 
 We have commenced a share repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to conduct quarterly repurchase offers to allow its shareholders to tender their shares at a price equal to the net offering price per share for the applicable class of shares on each date of repurchase. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. We intend to limit the number of shares to be repurchased in each quarter to no more than 5.00 of its outstanding shares of common stock. 
 Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct periodic repurchase offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS. 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5, the Board designated the Adviser as our valuation designee to perform fair value determinations relating to the value of assets held by us for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the average bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as the valuation designee, based on, among other things, independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of our Adviser. 
 As part of the valuation process, the Adviser, as the valuation designee, takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 Our Adviser, as the valuation designee, undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the average bid price of those market quotations; 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser s valuation committee; 
 Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser s valuation committee; 
 Our Adviser, as the valuation designee, reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; 
 Each quarter, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, provides the Audit Committee a summary or description of material fair value matters that occurred in the prior quarter and on an annual basis, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, will provide the Audit Committee with a written assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of its fair value process; and 
 The Audit Committee oversees the valuation designee and will report to the Board on any valuation matters requiring the Board s attention. 
 We conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis. 
 We apply ASC 820, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below: 
 Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 118 

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Adviser, as the valuation designee, evaluates the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), the Adviser, as the valuation designee, subjects those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Financial and Derivative Instruments 
 Pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, all derivative instruments entered into by us are designated as hedging instruments. For all derivative instruments designated as a hedge, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument shall be recorded in the same line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item. Fair value is estimated by discounting remaining payments using applicable current market rates, or market quotes, if available. Rule 18f-4 requires BDCs that use derivatives to, among other things, comply with a value-at-risk leverage limit, adopt a derivatives risk management program, and implement certain testing and board reporting procedures. We do not currently use derivatives. Rule 18f-4 exempts BDCs that qualify as limited derivatives users from the aforementioned requirements, provided that these BDCs adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the BDC s derivatives risks and comply with certain recordkeeping requirements. Rule 18f-4 provides that a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Pursuant to Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. We currently qualify as a limited derivatives user and expect to continue to do so. We have adopted a derivatives policy that complies with the recordkeeping requirements of Rule 18f-4. 
 
 Interest and Dividend Income Recognition 
 Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization and accretion of discounts or premiums. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends, the majority of which is structured at initial underwriting. PIK interest or dividends represent accrued interest or dividends that are added to the principal amount of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or at the occurrence of a certain liquidation event. Discounts to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. Premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized to first call date. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. If at any point we believe PIK interest is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest income. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 119 

Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. 
 Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distributions for tax purposes equal to at least the sum of: 
 90 of our investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and 
 90 of our net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. 
 As a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. 
 We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below. 
 Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; 
 98.2 of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and 
 100 of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. 
 While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We intend to pay monthly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 With respect to distributions we have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan which was amended and restated on May 6, 2024. The amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan provides for reinvestment of any cash distributions on behalf of shareholders who have enrolled in the distribution reinvestment plan. As a result, if the Board authorizes and declares a cash distribution, then the shareholders who have enrolled in the distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. We expect to use newly issued shares to implement the distribution reinvestment plan. 
 Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2021, and continue to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as distributions. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we generally must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In order for us to not be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 
 120 

98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4 nondeductible U.S. excise tax on this income. 
 We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2023. As applicable, our prior three tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and inflation risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We primarily invest in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, as our valuation designee, based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Adviser, as the valuation designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Credit Risk 
 We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting to reputable financial institutions the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held the majority of our cash balances with a single highly rated money center bank and such balances are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We seek to mitigate this exposure by monitoring the credit standing of these financial institutions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In a low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 99.0 of our debt investments based on fair value were floating rates and the majority of our debt investments have a floor of 0.8 . Additionally, the weighted average reference rate floor, based on fair value, of our debt investments was 0.7 and the majority of our debt investments have a floor of 0.8 . The Revolving Credit Facility, the SPV Asset Facility I, the SPV Asset Facility II, and the Series 2023B Notes bear interest at variable interest rates with no interest rate floor. Athena CLO III bears interest at fixed and variable rates. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments) assuming each floating rate investment is subject to 3-month reference rate election and there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 in thousands) Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income (1) 
 Up 300 basis points 142,574 60,836 81,738 Up 200 basis points 95,049 40,557 54,492 Up 100 basis points 47,525 20,279 27,246 Down 100 basis points (47,525) (20,279) (27,246) Down 200 basis points (95,049) (40,557) (54,492) Down 300 basis points (142,461) (60,836) (81,625) 
 (1) Excludes the impact of income based fees 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates. 
 122 

Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, borrow in certain foreign currencies under our credit facilities or issue notes in certain foreign currencies. These investments, borrowings and issuances are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts or cross currency swaps to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. Instead of entering into a foreign currency forward contract in connection with loans or other investments denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan, issuance or investment. To the extent the loan, issuance or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our credit facilities, we may utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation is likely to continue in the near to medium-term, particularly in the United States, with the possibility that monetary policy may tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies profit margins. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

 We commenced a share repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to conduct quarterly repurchase offers to allow our shareholders to tender their shares at a price equal to the net offering price per share for the applicable class of shares on each date of repurchase. 
 Our Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will engage in any share repurchase, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of our Board, we may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of our investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. The purpose of the offers to repurchase is to provide shareholders with the potential for a measure of liquidity since there is otherwise no public market for shares of our common stock. 
 We intend to limit the number of shares to be repurchased in each quarter to no more than 5.00 of our outstanding shares of common stock. 
 
 Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.
