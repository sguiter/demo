 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

. The Company expects to incur significant additional losses and liabilities
in connection with its start-up and commercialization activities. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from
its operations to pay its operating expenses. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classifications of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
There are no assurances that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

Management believes that the Company s future
success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations, generate cash from operating activities, and obtain additional
financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations, or sell additional shares
of stock or borrow additional funds. The Company s inability to obtain additional cash could have a material adverse effect on its
financial position, results of operations, and its ability to continue in existence. 

Operating results for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, may not be indicative of full year 2024 results. 

In management s opinion, the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our financial position as of September 30,
2024, and our results of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023.

Business Overview 

Blue Biofuels, Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on
March 28, 2012, as Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. Since December 2013, Blue Biofuels, Inc. (the Company has been a
technology company focused on emerging technologies in renewable energy, biofuels, and lignin. 

In early 2018, the Company s chief executive
officer CEO Ben Slager invented a new reactor technology with a higher yield and a continuous throughput in the Cellulose-to-Sugar
process, or CTS, and the Company filed a process patent application for this technology. Mr. Slager has since further developed the system
with the technical staff of the Company. The CTS patent was awarded in 2021 in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 10,994,255) and has
subsequently been granted in Japan, Canada and El Salvador. The Company also filed this patent in other major jurisdictions of the world
including the European Patent Organization, Australia, Brazil, China, the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, and the
Russian Federation. The patent applications are currently pending in all of these international jurisdictions. In addition to this patent,
the Company has received one additional patent in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 11,484,858B2), for which it has also applied in all
the above-mentioned jurisdictions. Further, the company has filed for 3 other patents in the United States which are currently pending. 

16 

Mr. Slager has since further developed the system
with the technical staff of the Company. The patented CTS process is a continuous mechanical/chemical dry process for breaking down cellulosic
material for conversion into biofuels. CTS can break down any cellulosic material including grasses and agricultural waste. The
CTS mechanical/chemical process allows for exact process control to ensure that all the material passing through it does so on the optimum
reaction parameters through which optimal efficiency is achieved. 

The new technology made it worthwhile to financially
restructure the Company through Chapter 11. The Company voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 on October 22, 2018, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in the Southern District of Florida. The Company exited Chapter 11 on September 18, 2019, while keeping all classes, including shareholders,
unimpaired. The bankruptcy case was closed on October 25, 2019. 

CTS is environmentally friendly in that it recycles
the water and catalyst, and it has a low carbon footprint: the amount of added atmospheric carbon created by burning the biofuels produced
by the CTS system was absorbed by the plant-based feedstock while growing and is merely released back into the atmosphere. No extra CO2
is released into the atmosphere when our biofuels are burned. This is to be distinguished from fossil fuels because new CO2 is released
when fossil fuels are burned. 

The Company believes a significant difference between
CTS cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol is the wide range of abundantly available feedstocks that CTS can process compared to just corn
as the feedstock. The CTS feedstocks are nonfood and have much lower costs than corn. In addition, while in corn ethanol only the corn
kernels are used, CTS uses the whole plant or its waste products, meaning it could obtain much higher yields per acre. 

In 2022, the Company partnered with K.R. Komarek to
build its CTS machines going forward. Komarek is an industry leading manufacturing company that builds briquetting machines and compaction/granulation
systems with throughput capacities up to 50 tons per hour. 

In 2023, the Company completed the build-out of a
pilot plant based on a modified Komarek machine and is in the process of further testing and optimizing the plant. In September 2024,
the Company received a 1.15 million grant from the Department of Energy to complete the commercialization of its CTS process. The Company
believes that it can optimize the pre and post processing elements at this pilot scale plant to finalize design and operational parameters
to provide operating cost estimates of a full-scale commercial volume system. Due to its mechanical nature and modularity, we anticipate
that one plant would have multiple modular CTS systems. 

In addition, the Company has licensed the patented
Vertimass Process that is a single-step process that converts ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other renewable biofuels
including bio-gasoline. The license agreement with Vertimass is the subject to a confidentiality agreement between the parties. 

Plan of Operation 

In January 2024, the Company formed a 50-50 joint
venture partnership with Vertimass called VertiBlue Fuels, LLC, that has the mission to build an ethanol-to-SAF facility in Florida with
the initial goal to produce around 10 million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and then expand SAF production to approximately
70 million gallon per year. VertiBlue Fuels plans to initially convert sugarcane ethanol, and then, when the Company s CTS technology
is fully commercialized, to build commercial CTS and ethanol facilities on the front-end to produce cellulosic SAF and generate the large
D7 RIN and other government credits. In any event, commencing commercial production will require project financing. 

The total process from cellulosic feedstock to SAF
consists basically of three steps: 

1) 
 Conversion from feedstock to fermentable cellulosic sugars (CTS) 

2) 
 Ferment the cellulosic sugars into cellulosic ethanol. 

3) 
 Covert the ethanol into SAF and related products. This third step happens with the Vertimass technology which the Company has licensed. 

17 

Any new biofuels plant that is built would require
various government permits. In particular, renewable fuels are subject to rigorous testing and premarket approval requirements by the
EPA s Office of Transportation and Air Quality and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and,
in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, storage and use of renewable fuels. The
process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure
of resources. The Company anticipates raising the necessary capital for this as a part of its project-based financing. 

The ethanol industry is competitive with over 200
ethanol plants in the United States alone. Currently, the vast majority use corn as feedstock. Their profitability depends highly on the
fluctuations between the price of corn and the price of ethanol. Since the Company does not plan to use corn, and plans on having long-term
purchase agreements with cellulosic feedstock suppliers, we anticipate that our profitability will be more consistent. Further, cellulosic
biofuels yield much higher incentives than non-cellulosic biofuels. 

The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which included the
Renewable Fuel Standard Program enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), mandates a certain amount of renewable fuel
be blended into the transportation fuel used by all vehicles in the country. This Program provides monetary incentives to companies that
produce renewable transportation fuel, and establishes Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) or credits for each gallon of renewable
transportation fuel produced in the United States, and breaks down those fuels into different D-codes depending on the source of the renewable
fuel. D3 is the code for renewable ethanol that comes from cellulosic materials. The EPA s final D3 RIN volume mandates for cellulosic
biofuel include 840 million gallons for 2023, 1.09 billion gallons for 2024, and 1.38 billion gallons for 2025 (the D3 mandate). This
mandate has increased every year and is statutorily mandated to increase in the future and become a larger portion of the full renewable
fuels mandate, if and when cellulosic biofuels can be produced profitably in larger and larger quantities. The RFS mandate for 2024 calls
for 21.54 billion gallons of total renewable fuel, 15 billion from conventional biofuels (corn ethanol) and 6.54 billion from advanced
biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels. The blend wall (or upper limit to the amount of ethanol that can be blended into
U.S. gasoline and automobile performance and comply with the Clean Air Act) of limiting ethanol content in gasoline to 10 , limits the
total amount of ethanol consumed in the United States. Recent proposals have make 15 blending available year around in some states. The
value of the D3 RIN fluctuates, but as of this filing, it is approximately 3.17 per gallon of ethanol. For comparison, the D6 RIN for
corn ethanol is 0.69. To profit from these incentives, the Company plans to apply for these D3 RIN credits as it brings its first plant
into commercial operation. 

Section 45Z of the Inflation Reduction Act passed
on August 16, 2022, offers a Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC) per gallon of transportation fuel produced with a base amount of 20 cents
per gallon or up to 1 per gallon for a qualified facility (depending on its carbon index) that was built while paying at least prevailing
wages and which met apprenticeship requirements. For sustainable aviation fuel, those figures are 35 cents and 1.75 per gallon respectively.
The Company plans to apply for CFPC credits when it begins building its commercial facilities. The CFPC currently does not apply to transportation
fuel sold after December 31, 2027. 

A Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credit (LCFS) is offered
by various states (primarily California) for any amount of reduced CO2 in the production lifecycle of transportation fuels as compared
to the amount of CO2 emitted in the production lifecycle of fossil fuels. The production lifecycle includes transportation costs to the
point of use. California is currently offering around 66 per metric ton of CO2 reduction. When it is closer to commercial production,
the Company plans to analyze the cost effectiveness of applying for these LCFS credits to determine in which state it could earn the most
credits. 

At commercial scale, management expects to be able
to earn substantial renewable fuel credits and produce sustainable ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and other sustainable biofuels
more profitably than they could be from existing commercial corn ethanol producers. Cellulosic ethanol comes with a much more valuable
D3 RIN credit as compared to the D6 RIN allocated to corn ethanol; cellulosic SAF comes with a very valuable D7 RIN, and cellulosic bio-gasoline
comes with a valuable D3 RIN. The Company also expects to receive Clean Fuel Production Credits related to section 45Z of the Inflation
Reduction Act, and the Company also plans to pursue Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits. 

After its first plant is profitable, the Company intends
to grow with additional plants in the United States and explore international growth by either licensing the CTS technology or forming
joint ventures with foreign domestic partners to build plants. 

The Company believes that its management and consultants
have significant experience in the development of technologies from concept to commercialization. As of this date, the Company has not
generated any material revenues from its business.

Capital Formation 

From January 1, 2024, through the date of filing,
the Company issued an aggregate of 114,545 shares of its common stock for services valued at 10,094. 

From January 1, 2024, through the date of filing,
the Company issued an aggregate of 177,500 warrants for services valued at 11,844 and 150,000 warrants for interest with a fair value
of 9,947. 

From January 1, 2024, through the date of filing,
4,025,000 previously issued options vested. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized additional stock-based
compensation of 45,527 in connection with modification of the exercise price of 7,475,000 vested options. 

From January 1, 2024, through the date of filing,
3,397,981 warrants expired or were cancelled. 

Going Concern 

The Company has incurred losses since inception, has
a working capital deficiency, and may be unable to raise further capital. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital
deficit of 1,743,047 and had incurred accumulated losses of 55,466,394 since its inception. The Company expects to incur significant
additional losses in connection with its continued start-up activities. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and its need to obtain additional financing to sustain operations.
The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its
obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to pay its operating
expenses. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the three and nine month period
ended September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2023 

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company recognized 0 in revenue as opposed to 0 in 2023. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company s general and administrative expenses increased by 17,821 to 236,981 from 219,160 in 2023. This increase is primarily
the result of 42,552 in accounting expenses in 2024 versus 5,500 in 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company s general and administrative expenses decreased by 162,235 to 781,718 from 943,953 in 2023. This decrease is primarily
the result of 53,262 in stock-based compensation expense in 2024 versus 169,382 in 2023, and advertising and promotion declining to
 0 in 2024 from 46,579 in 2023. 

Interest expense decreased in the quarter ended September
30, 2024 by 22,026 to 3,635 from 25,661 in 2023. Interest expense decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 by 16,574
to 54,569 from 71,143. 

Research and development (R D) costs for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, were 410,805, an increase of 117,131 from 293,674 in 2023. The increase in R D expenses is primarily
the result of equity-based compensation of 127,446 in 2024 versus 0 in 2023. 

Research and development (R D) costs for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,309,829, a decrease of 431,489 from 1,741,318 in 2023. The decrease in R D expenses is primarily
the result of a decrease in bonuses to 0 from 276,930 in 2023, and equity-based compensation of 390,739 from 467,646 in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 149,366
in cash and cash equivalents, and total stockholders equity on September 30, 2024, was negative 2,511,937. As of December 31,
2023, the Company had 41,008 in cash and cash equivalents, and total stockholders deficit at December 31, 2023, was 3,561,082.
Total debt, including convertible notes, accounts payable and other notes payable at September 30, 2024, together with interest payable
thereon and legacy liabilities, was 4,001,000 a decrease of 590,301 from December 31, 2023, where it stood at 4,591,301. This decrease
is primarily attributable to the cancellation of 2,417,502 in legacy debt related to the Company s restructuring, offset by an
increased in deferred compensation of 718,625. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company s net cash used in operating activities decreased by 702,065 to 792,412 from 1,494,478 in the nine months ending September
30, 2023. This is primarily attributed to the extinguishment of debt of 2,417,502 in 2024 versus nil in 2023, offset by an increase in
deferred wages to 718,625 from 366,988 in 2023. 

19 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company s investing activities used 29,230 in cash, as compared to 307,782 in the first nine months of 2023. This can be primarily
attributed to capitalizing 282,038 used to purchase machinery and equipment for a pilot plant in 2023, as compared to 0 in 2024. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company generated an aggregate of 930,000 through its financing activities versus 1,675,022 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
which is a decrease of 745,022. This decrease from the prior year can primarily be attributed to net proceeds of 1,002,772 for the issuance
of common stock in 2023 and 97,250 from the exercise of warrants and options, versus 0 for both in 2024. 

Capital Resources 

At this time, the Company has limited liquidity and
capital resources. To continue funding its operations, the Company will need to generate revenue or obtain additional financing for current
and future operations. The Company anticipates needing additional funds for G A expenses and will seek project financing for a commercial
ethanol to SAF facility in addition to funds needed to complete the commercialization of its CTS system. There is no guarantee that the
Company will achieve all of the additional funding that is needed. 

As of the date of this filing, in 2024 the Company
has raised 930,000 through the issuance of convertible notes and 0 through the issuance of shares and the exercise of warrants. The
Company previously raised 16,963,625 in shares and 1,970,916 through converted notes and 700,000 in debt or convertible notes since
inception. However, there is no guarantee that the company will be able to raise any additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company. 

The inability to obtain this funding either in the
near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize
the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to reevaluate and revise its operations. 

Equity 

As of September 30, 2024, shareholders deficit
was 2,511,937. 

There were 305,678,008 shares of common stock issued
and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 

There were no preferred shares outstanding. 

The Company has paid no dividends.
