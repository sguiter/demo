Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms

The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). However, the Company also presents and discusses
 certain non-GAAP financial measures that it believes are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. Management may also use such non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the effectiveness of business strategies and for planning and
 budgeting purposes. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative or substitute for the results reflected in the Company s GAAP financial statements.

We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important supplemental measures of operating performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other parties
 interested in our industry. We believe that EBITDA is helpful to investors in evaluating our results of operations without the impact of expenses affected by financing methods, accounting methods and the tax environment. We believe that Adjusted
 EBITDA provides additional useful information to investors by excluding non-operational or non-recurring expenses to provide a measure of operating performance that is more comparable from period to period. Management also uses these non-GAAP
 financial measures for evaluating operating performance, assessing the effectiveness of business strategies, projecting future capital needs, budgeting and other planning purposes.

The following key performance indicators presented herein, some of which represent non-GAAP financial measures, have these meanings and are calculated as follows:

EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, severance, gain/loss on sale of assets, costs related to impairment and other lease
 charges, franchisee default and closed store revenue/expense, and closed and non-operating store costs.

14 

Index 

Retail sales represents the restaurant sales reported by our franchisees, which may be segmented by brand or domestic/international locations.

Comparable store retail sales includes the retail sales for restaurants that have been open for at least 18 months as of the end of the reporting period. The sales results for a restaurant that was closed
 temporarily for remodeling or relocation within the same trade area are included in the calculation only for the days that the restaurant was open in both periods being compared.

Average units open reflects the number of restaurants open during a reporting period weighted by the percentage of the days in a reporting period that each restaurant was open.

Non-operating store costs represent gain or loss on asset disposal, store closure expenses, lease termination expenses and expenses related to abandoned store sites.

Franchisee default and closed store revenue/expense represents the net of accelerated revenues and costs attributable to defaulted area development agreements and closed franchised stores.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024 increased 0.1 million compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The following table sets forth a
 reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods shown (in thousands):

Revenues:

Revenues are derived from franchise royalties, supplier and distributor incentives, franchise license fees, area development exclusivity fees and foreign master license fees,
 advertising funds, supplier convention funds, sublease rental income, and other income. The volume of supplier incentive revenues is dependent on the level of chain-wide retail sales, which are impacted by changes in comparable store sales and
 restaurant count, as well as the products sold to franchisees through third-party food distributors.

Total revenues for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 and for the same period in the prior fiscal year were 3.1 million and 3.1 million, respectively.

Pizza Inn Franchise and License 

Pizza Inn franchise revenues increased by 0.1 million to 2.7 million for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
 The 4.5 increase was driven by increases in supplier and distributor incentives.

Pie Five Franchise and License 

Pie Five franchise revenues decreased by 0.1 million to 0.3 million for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
 The 29.7 decrease was driven by decreases in domestic royalties.

Costs and Expenses:

General and Administrative Expenses 

Total general and administrative expenses increased by 0.1 million to 1.4 million for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior
 fiscal year. The 7.4 increase was driven by increases in legal fees, primarily due to decreases in legal settlement recoveries.

Franchise Expenses 

Franchise expenses include general and administrative expenses directly related to the sale and continuing service of domestic and international franchises. Total franchise expenses
 decreased by 0.2 million to 1.0 million for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The 15.1 decrease was driven by decreases in advertising fees.

Provision (Recovery) for Credit Losses 

The Company monitors franchisee receivable balances and adjusts credit terms when necessary to minimize the Company s exposure to high-risk accounts receivable. For the three month
 period ended September 29, 2024, recoveries for credit losses was 17 thousand compared to provision for credit losses of 25 thousand for the same period in the prior fiscal year. During the three month period ended September 29, 2024, the Company
 recorded a gain in provision for credit losses due to the recoveries of receivables that had been previously reserved.

Interest Expense and Income 

Interest expense was zero for the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to zero for the same fiscal period of the prior year. Interest income increased by 80 thousand to
 82 thousand for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by interest received on U.S. Treasury bills.

Amortization and Depreciation Expense 

Amortization and depreciation expense decreased by 12 thousand to 43 thousand for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior
 fiscal year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower depreciation of equipment.

For the three months ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 169 thousand and 132 thousand, respectively. The increase was
 driven by increases in federal taxes, primarily due to higher taxable income.

The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable
 temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets.

Basic net income per share increased 0.01 per share to 0.04 per share for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
 The Company had net income of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to net income of 0.4 million in the comparable period in the prior fiscal year, on revenues of 3.1 million for the three months ended September 29,
 2024 compared to 3.1 million in the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The stability in revenue was primarily due to increases in supplier and distributor incentives, offset by a decrease in domestic royalties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the three month period ended September 29, 2024, the Company's primary source of liquidity was proceeds from operating activities.

Cash flows from operating activities generally reflect net income adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, changes in deferred taxes, stock-based
 compensation, and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities was 0.5 million for the three month period ended September 29, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities of
 0.6 million for the three month period ended September 24, 2023. The primary driver of decreased operating cash flow during the three month period ended September 29, 2024 was decreased accrued expenses related to payroll and related costs.

Cash flows from investing activities reflect purchases and maturities of short-term investments as well as net proceeds from the sale of assets and capital expenditures for the
 purchase of Company assets. Cash used in investing activities during the three month period ended September 29, 2024 was 2.0 million compared to cash used in investing activities of 12 thousand for the three months ended September 24, 2023. Net
 cash used by investing activities during the three month period ended September 29, 2024 was primarily attributable to increased purchases of U.S. treasury bills.

Cash flows used in financing activities generally reflect changes in the Company's stock and debt activity during the period. Net cash used in financing activities was zero for the
 three month periods ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023.

Management believes the cash on hand combined with net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the next 12 months and beyond.

Employee Retention Credit

On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the CAA was signed into law. The CAA expanded eligibility for an employee retention credit for companies
 impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with fewer than five hundred employees and at least a twenty percent decline in gross receipts compared to the same quarter in 2019, to encourage retention of employees. This payroll tax credit was a refundable
 tax credit against certain federal employment taxes. For the fiscal year ended June 26, 2022, the Company recorded 0.7 million of other income for the employee retention credit. As of September 29, 2024, 0.6 million has been received and 0.1
 million is still outstanding and included within accounts receivable on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets,
 liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and
 assumptions are reviewed periodically. Actual results could differ materially from estimates.

19 

Index 

The Company believes the following critical accounting policies require estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, are susceptible to change, and therefore
 require subjective judgments. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition in future periods.

Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables generated from franchise royalties and supplier concessions. The Company records an allowance for credit losses to allow for any
 amounts which may be unrecoverable based upon an analysis of the Company s prior collection experience, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. Actual realization of accounts receivable could differ materially from the Company s
 estimates.

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is
 evaluated based on the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from use and eventual disposition of the assets compared to their carrying value. If impairment is indicated, the carrying value of an impaired asset is
 reduced to its fair value, based on discounted estimated future cash flows.

Franchise revenue consists of income from license fees, royalties, area development and foreign master license agreements, advertising fund revenues, supplier incentive and
 convention contribution revenues. Franchise fees, area development and foreign master license agreement fees are amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the related contract agreement. In the event of a closed franchise or
 defaulted development agreement, the remaining balance of unamortized license fees will be recognized in entirety as of the date of the closure or default. Royalties and advertising fund revenues, which are based on a percentage of franchise retail
 sales, are recognized as income as retail sales occur. Supplier incentive revenues are recognized as earned, typically as the underlying commodities are shipped.

The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary
 differences, and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, using a more likely than not standard. In
 assessing the need for the valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. In making such assessment, more weight is given to evidence that can be
 objectively verified, including recent operating performance.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10, which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and
 disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. ASC 740-10 requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than
 not threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being
 realized upon ultimate settlement. As of September 29, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.

The Company assesses its exposures to loss contingencies from legal matters based upon factors such as the current status of the cases and consultations with external counsel and
 provides for the exposure by accruing an amount if it is judged to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. If the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate, operating results could be adversely impacted.

Item 3.
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required for a smaller reporting company.

Item 4.
 Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information it is required to disclose in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
 procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal
 financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
