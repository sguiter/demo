Historically,
we sold and installed video surveillance equipment, primarily for security purposes and secondarily for operational efficiencies and
marketing. We also provided video hosting, in-vehicle streaming video, archiving, and real-time remote surveillance services to a variety
of businesses and organizations. While we previously only used off-the shelf camera systems from well-known camera brands, we now source
our own cameras using manufacturers in Taiwan in order for us to be more flexible in fulfilling our customer needs. We now have the capability
to provide IP cameras and NVRs based on customer specifications. We still utilize ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) cameras,
which are a global standard for the interface of IP-based physical security products. 

In
2014, we changed our revenue model from direct project-based sales to licensing our platform and selling IoT hardware to service providers
such as telecommunications companies, integrators and other technology resellers already providing services to an existing customer base.
Partnering with service providers that have an existing loyal subscriber base allows us to focus on servicing just a handful of our partners
and concentrating on our technology offering. Service providers leverage their end-user infrastructure to sell, bill, and provide customer
service for Iveda s product offering. This business model provides dual revenue streams one from hardware sales and the
other from monthly licensing fees. 

Iveda
Taiwan, our subsidiary in Taiwan, specializes in deploying new, and integrating existing, video surveillance systems for airports, commercial
buildings, government customers, data centers, shopping centers, hotels, banks, and Safe City. Iveda Taiwan combines security surveillance
products, software, and services to provide integrated security solutions to the end user. Through Iveda Taiwan, we have access not only
to Asian markets but also to Asian manufacturers and engineering expertise. Iveda Taiwan is our research and development arm, working
with a team of developers in Taiwan. 

noncontrolling interest in the Company s
consolidated subsidiary Iveda Phils, Inc. located in the Philippines. Since the Company consolidates the financial statements of all wholly-owned
and controlled subsidiaries, the noncontrolling owners share of each subsidiaries results of operations are deducted from
net income or loss in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

t
record any impairment losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Revenues
from fixed-price equipment installation contracts (project sales) are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage
completed is measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract. This method is used because
management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Because of inherent uncertainties
in estimating costs and revenues, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change. 

Contract
costs include all direct material, subcontractors, labor costs, and equipment costs related to contract performance. General and administrative
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such
losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income
and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Changes in estimated job profitability resulting from job performance,
job conditions, contract penalty provisions, claims, change orders, and settlements are accounted for as changes in estimates in the
current period. Profit incentives are included in revenues when their realization is reasonably assured. Claims are included in revenues
when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated. 

Iveda
 US hardware sales are made through independent distributors or integrators who purchase products from the Company at a wholesale
 price and sell to the end user (typically municipalities or a commercial customer) at a retail price. The distributor retains the
 margin as its compensation for its role in the transaction. The distributor or integrator generally maintains product inventory or
 product is drop shipped from the manufacturer. Accordingly, upon application of steps one through five above, revenue is recorded
 when the product is shipped to the distributor or as directed by the distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement. 

Iveda
 US also sells software that includes licensing fees that are paid either monthly or yearly. The revenues are recorded monthly, if
 the license is paid yearly the revenue will be recorded as deferred revenue and amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective
 time period.

According
to the Taiwan corporate income tax TCIT reporting system, the TCIT sales cut-off base is concurrent with the business
tax classified as value-added type VAT which will be reported to the Ministry of Finance MOF on a bi-monthly
basis. Since the VAT and TCIT are accounted for on a VAT tax basis that recorded all sales on business tax on a VAT tax reporting system,
the Company is bound to report the TCIT according to the MOF prescribed tax reporting rules. Under the VAT tax reporting system, sales
cut-off did not take the accrual base but rather on a VAT taxable reporting basis. Therefore, when the company adopted US GAAP on accrual
basis, the sales cut-off TCIT timing difference which derived from the VAT reporting system will create a temporary sales cut-off timing
difference and this difference is reflected in the deferred tax assets or liabilities calculations.

Overview 

Iveda
has been offering real-time IP video surveillance technologies to our customers since 2005. While we still offer video surveillance technologies,
our core product line has evolved to include AI intelligent search technology that provide true intelligence to any video surveillance
system and IoT (Internet of Things) devices and platforms. Our evolution is in response to digital transformation demands from many cities
and organizations across the globe. Our IvedaAI intelligent video search technology adds critical intelligence to normally passive video
surveillance systems. IvedaAI provides AI functions to any IP camera and most popular network video recorders (NVR) and video management
systems (VMS). IvedaAI comes with an appliance or server, preconfigured with multiple AI functions based on the end user requirements.

IvedaAI
consists of deep-learning video analytics software running in a computer/server environment that can either be deployed at an edge level
or data center for centralized cloud model. We combined hardware and artificial intelligence software for fast and efficient video search
for objects stored in an external (NVR) or storage device and live streaming video data from any IP camera. 

IvedaAI
works with any ONVIF-compliant IP cameras and most popular NVR/VMS (Video Management System) platforms, enabling accurate search across
dozens to thousands of cameras in less than one second. IvedaAI products are designed to maximize efficiency, save time, and cut cost.
Instead of watching hours of video recording after-the-fact, users can set up alerts. 

Iveda
offers many IoT sensors and devices for various applications such as energy management, smart home, smart building, smart community and
patient/elder care. Our gateway and station serve as the main hub for sensors and devices in any given area. They are equipped with high-level
communication protocols such as Zigbee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB. They connect to the Internet via Ethernet or cellular data network.
We provide IoT platforms that enable centralized device management and push digital services on a massive scale. Our smart devices include
water sensor, environment sensor, entry sensor, smart plug, siren, body temperature pad, care watch and tracking devices. 

We
also offer smart power technology for office buildings, schools, shopping centers, hotels, hospitals, and smart city projects. Our smart
power hardware is equipped with an RS485 communication interface allowing the meters to be connected to various third-party SCADA software
for monitoring and control purposes. This line of product includes smart power, water meter, smart lighting controls systems, and smart
payment system. 

Iveda s
Cerebro manages all the components of our smart power technology including statistics on energy consumption. Cerebro is a software platform
designed to integrate multiple unconnected energy, security and safety applications and devices and control them through one comprehensive
user interface. 

Cerebro s
roadmap includes dashboard for all of Iveda s platforms for central management of all devices. Cerebro is system agnostic and will
support cross-platform interoperability. The common unified user interface will allow remote control of platforms, sensors and subsystems
throughout an entire environment. This integration and unification of all subsystems enable acquisition and analysis of all information
on one central command center, allowing comprehensive, effective, and overall management and protection of a city. 

Iveda s
Utilus smart pole technology is a smart power management and wireless mesh communications network deployed on new or existing light pole
structures. The Utilus network uses WiFi, 4G and 5G small cell capabilities, and other wireless protocols to provide distributed video
surveillance with AI video search technology and remote management of local devices such as trackers, water meters, electrical meters,
valves, circuit breakers and sensors. 

In
the last few years, the smart city concept has been a hot topic among cities across the globe. With little to no human interaction, technology
increases efficiency, expedites decision making, and reduces response time. Dwindling public safety budgets and resources has necessitated
the transformation. More and more municipalities are using next-generation technologies to improve the safety and security of its citizens.
Our response is our complete suite of IoT technologies, including AI intelligent video search technology, smart sensors, tracking devices,
video surveillance systems, and smart power. 

We
license our platform and sell IoT hardware to service providers such as telecommunications companies, integrators and other technology
resellers already providing services to an existing customer base. Partnering with service providers that have an existing loyal customer
base allows us to focus on servicing just a handful of our partners and concentrating on our technology offering. Service providers leverage
their end-user infrastructure to sell, bill, and provide customer service for Iveda s product offering. This business model provides
dual revenue streams one from hardware sales and the other from monthly licensing fees.

delivery to the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company PLDT for distribution to its customers with a cloud video
surveillance service offering, utilizing our Sentir platform. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A description of our critical accounting policies and related
judgments and estimates that affect the preparation of our financial statements is set forth in our consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2023. Such policies are unchanged. 

New
Accounting Standards 

There
were no new standards recently issued which would have an impact on our operations or disclosures. 

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Revenue 

We
recorded net consolidated revenue of 2.40 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.87 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.53 million, or 175 . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our service
revenue was 0.06 million, or 3 of net revenue, and our equipment sales and installation revenue was 2.34 million, or 97 of net revenue.
For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our service revenue was 0.09 million, or 10 of consolidated net revenue, and our equipment
sales and installation revenue was 0.79 million, or 90 of net revenue. The increase in total revenue in 2024 compared with the same
period in 2023 is attributable primarily to increased equipment sales from Iveda Taiwan as a result of delivery timing related to long-term
contracts. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Total
cost of revenue was 2.0 million (83 of revenue; gross margin of 17 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.73
million (84 of revenue; gross margin of 16 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.26 million, or 172 . The
increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased Iveda Taiwan revenue. The slight increase in overall gross margin was primarily
attributed to the higher margin equipment and service revenue for new customers. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses were 1.01 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1.05 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 0.04) million, or (3 ). This net decrease in operating expenses in 2024 compared with 2023 is due primarily
to no significant investor relations campaigns in the US based operations during this period. 

23 

Loss
from Operations 

Loss
from operations decreased to 0.60 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.91 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.31 million, or 34 . A majority of the decrease in loss from operations was primarily due to
increased revenues and related gross margins and reduction in operating expenses. 

Other
Income (Expense), Net 

Other
income (expense), net was 27,363 of net other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 54,303 of net
other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 26,904) of other income, or (50 ). The majority of the
other income for 2024 and 2023 was interest income from cash in the bank. 

Net
Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest 

Net
Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest of the Philippines Joint Venture was 19,331 for the three months ended September 30,
2024 compared to 23,522 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction is attributed to less pre-revenue expenses in
2024 versus the initial travel and presentation expenses of 2023 to various cities in the Philippines. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss was 0.57 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.85 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease of 0.28 million, or 33 , in net loss was primarily due to increased revenues and related gross margins and reduction
in operating expenses. 

Results
of Operations for the Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Revenue 

We
recorded net consolidated revenue of 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 5.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.2 million), or (22 ). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our service revenue
was 0.27 million, or 6 of net revenue, and our equipment sales and installation revenue was 4.0 million, or 94 of net revenue. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our service revenue was 0.36 million, or 7 of consolidated net revenue, and our equipment
sales and installation revenue was 5.1 million, or 93 of net revenue. The decrease in total revenue in 2024 compared with the same
period in 2023 is attributable primarily to decreased equipment sales from Iveda Taiwan as a result of delivery timing related to long-term
contracts. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Total
cost of revenue was 3.2 million (74 of revenue; gross margin of 26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 4.6
million (83 of revenue; gross margin of 17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.4 million), or (30 ). The
decrease in cost of revenue was primarily driven by decreased Iveda Taiwan revenue. The increase in overall gross margin was primarily
attributed to the higher margin equipment and service revenue for smaller contracts. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses were 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 3.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 0.2 million, or 6 . This net increase in operating expenses in 2024 compared with 2023 is due primarily to
a ramp up in investor relations in the US based operations related to maintaining NASDAQ compliance. 

Loss
from Operations 

Loss
from operations was 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.3 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The loss from operations for the nine months was consistent because of the reduction in loss from operations in the most recent
quarter results. 

Other
Income (Expense), Net 

Other
income (expense), net was 111,657 of net other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 76,500 of net
other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 35,157 of other income, or 46 . The majority of the
other income for 2024 was interest income from cash in the bank. 

24 

Net
Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest 

Net
Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest of the Philippines Joint Venture was 40,330 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to 83,489 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction is attributed less pre-revenue expenses in 2024
versus the initial travel and presentation expenses of 2023 to various cities in the Philippines. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss was 2.16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.14 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase of 0.02 million, or 1 , in net loss was primarily due to increased gross margins and decreased operating costs. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.6 million compared to 4.8 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease
in our cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to the operating losses during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 offset by a sale of common stock and pre-funded warrants during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. There
are no legal or economic factors that materially impact our ability to transfer funds between our U.S.-based and Taiwan-based segments. 

Net
cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.2) million compared to 1.9) million net cash
used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
consisted primarily of the net loss of 2.2) million. Other factors for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.0) million
cash used from the increase of inventory and by the increase of 1.9) million of accounts receivable. Net cash used by operating activities

net loss of 2.1) million. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.3 million consisting primarily of the development
of the IvedaAI platforms. Net cash used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.6 million consisting
primarily of the development of the IvedaAI platforms. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.3 million compared with 0.9 million provided
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2024 of 2.3 million is primarily a result
of the sale of common stock and pre-funded warrants, 1.8 million, and the net proceeds from bank loans in Taiwan for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The cash provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is related primarily to the exercise of 945,900
warrants at 1.40 with net proceeds of 1.4 million offset by 0.45 million payments against short and long term loans in Taiwan during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

25 

We
have experienced significant operating losses since our inception. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 32 million in net operating
loss carryforwards available for federal income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in 2025. We did not recognize any benefit from
the federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2023 or 2022. We also had approximately 5.0 million in state net operating loss carryforwards,
which expire after five years. 

We
have limited liquidity and have not yet established a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs, based on our
current estimated burn rate. Accordingly, our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate greater revenue
through increased sales and/or our ability to raise additional funds through the capital markets. No assurance can be given that we will
be successful in future financing and revenue-generating efforts. Even if funding is available, we cannot assure investors that it will
be available on terms that are favorable to our existing stockholders. Additional funding may be achieved through the issuance of equity
or debt securities that could be significantly dilutive to the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. In addition, these
newly issued securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. Accordingly, such a
financing transaction could materially and adversely impact the price of our common stock. 

Substantially
all of our cash is deposited in three financial institutions, two in the United States and one in Taiwan. At times, amounts on deposit
in the United States may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. Deposits in Taiwan financial institutions are insured by CDIC Central
Deposit Insurance Corporation with maximum coverage of NTD 3 million. At times, amounts on deposit in Taiwan may be in excess
of the CDIC insurance limit. 

Our
accounts receivable are unsecured, and we are at risk to the extent such amounts become uncollectible. Although we perform periodic evaluations
of our customers credit and financial condition, we generally do not require collateral in exchange for our products and services
provided on credit. 

We
provide an allowance for doubtful collections, which is based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information,
and existing economic conditions. Payment terms for our U.S.-based segment require prepayment for most products before they are shipped
and monthly Sentir licensing fees, which are due in advance on the first day of each month. For our U.S.-based segment, accounts receivable
that are more than 120 days past due are considered delinquent. Payment terms for our Taiwan-based segment vary based on our agreements
with our customers. Generally, we receive payment for our products and services within one year of commencing the project, except that
we retain 5 of the total payment amount and release such amount one year after the completion of the project. For our U.S.-based segment,
we had no doubtful accounts receivable allowances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. For
our Taiwan-based segment, we set up no doubtful accounts receivable allowances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year
ended December 31, 2023. We deem the rest of our accounts receivable to be collectible based on certain factors, including the nature
of the customer contracts and past experience with similar customers. Delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit
valuation and specific circumstances of the customer, and we generally do not charge interest on past due receivables. 

Effects
of Inflation 

For
the periods for which financial information is presented, we do not believe that the current levels of inflation in the United States
have had a significant impact on our operations. Likewise, we do not believe that the current levels of inflation in Taiwan have had
a significant impact on the operations of Iveda Taiwan. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt, and we have not entered
into any synthetic leases. We are, therefore, not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise
if we had engaged in such relationships.

 QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(i) and are not required to provide information under this item. 

ITEM
 4. 
 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). There is inadequate knowledge of technical accounting and SEC reporting process in the Company.
The Company is filing financial statements with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) under accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America US GAAP ). The Company needs enough accounting personnel to perform all accounting functions
and that have appropriate experience in financial reporting under US GAAP. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as of December 31, 2023, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In
December 2013, we hired Robert J. Brilon, as Chief Financial Officer who has experience in SEC reporting and disclosures. We have plans
for hiring additional financial personnel and implementing additional controls and processes involving both of our financial personnel
in order to ensure all transactions are accounted for and disclosed in an accurate and timely manner. There have not been any other changes
in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d)
of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues,
misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple
error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management or Board override of the control. 

The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
