 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest Expenses 
 in millions) 

Compensation and benefits expenses of 6,733 million in the current quarter increased 13 from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance DCP and an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses of 19,889 million in the current year period increased 7 from the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher discretionary incentive compensation on higher revenues, partially offset by lower severance costs. 
 During the prior year period, Compensation and benefits expenses included severance costs of 308 million, associated with a reduction in workforce during the second quarter of 2023. This specific reduction in workforce occurred across the Firm s business segments and geographic regions, impacted approximately 4 of the Firm s global workforce, and resulted from the Firm s review of its global workforce, operating expenses and the business environment following the acquisitions of E TRADE Financial Corporation E TRADE and Eaton Vance Corp. Eaton Vance ), rather than a change in strategy or exit of businesses. We recorded severance costs 

of 207 million in the Institutional Securities business segment, 78 million in the Wealth Management business segment, and 23 million in the Investment Management business segment for the prior year period. These costs were primarily incurred in the Americas and EMEA, with the majority in the Americas. 
 Non-compensation expenses of 4,350 million in the current year quarter increased 7 from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend. 
 Non-compensation expenses of 12,810 million in the current year period increased 3 from the prior year period, primarily due to higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend, partially offset by lower legal expenses and the absence of integration-related expenses incurred in the prior year period. 
 In the prior year period, integration expenses were 244 million, of which 171 million related to the integration of E TRADE within the Wealth Management business segment and 73 million related to the integration of Eaton Vance within the Investment Management business segment. Integration-related expenses primarily included non-compensation expenses such as information technology expense related to the consolidation of platforms, and professional fees related to changes in legal entity structures and the integration of clients, within both Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. All integration-related activities were substantially completed as of December 31, 2023. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 79 million in the current quarter was primarily related to provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and growth across loan portfolios. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was 134 million, primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 
 
 The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 149 million in the current year period was primarily related to provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and growth across certain loan portfolios. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 529 million in the prior year period was primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Economic and Market Conditions 
 The economic environment, client and investor confidence and overall market sentiment continued to improve in the third quarter of 2024. While inflationary pressures have moderated and interest rates declined, geopolitical risks including ongoing tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. political cycle and the timing and pace of further interest rate reductions present ongoing risks to the economic environment. These factors have impacted, and could continue to impact capital markets and our businesses, as discussed further in Business Segments herein. 
 For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A non-GAAP financial measure excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 
 These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 
 We present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, net of financing costs on DCP investments from net revenues. We also exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on DCP from compensation expenses. The impact of DCP investments and DCP are primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment results. These measures allow for better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends. By excluding the impact of these items, we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. 

Compensation expense for DCP awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards. 
 We invest directly, as principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of our obligations under these DCP awards. Changes in the fair value of such investments, net of financing costs, are recorded in net revenues, and included in Transactional revenues in the Wealth Management business segment. Although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments recognized in net revenues, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period. While this timing difference may not be material to our Income before provision for income taxes in any individual period, it may impact the Wealth Management business segment reported ratios and operating metrics in certain periods due to potentially significant impacts to net revenues and compensation expenses. 
 For more information, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Other Matters in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe analysts, investors and other stakeholders consider useful to allow for comparability to peers and of the period-to-period use of our equity. The calculation of tangible common equity represents common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. In addition, we believe that certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity, such as return on average tangible common equity ROTCE and tangible book value per common share, also non-GAAP financial measures, are useful for evaluating the operating performance and capital adequacy of the business period-to-period, respectively. The calculation of ROTCE represents annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. The calculation of tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding. 
 The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

 1. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework herein). The sums of the segments Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity. 
 2. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment, annualized as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 
 Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 
 We have an ROTCE goal of 20 . Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. 
 See Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results. 
 ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein. 
 
 Business Segments 
 Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 
 For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, provision for credit losses, compensation expense and income taxes, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Segments in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 3. Includes Investments and Other revenues. 
 Equity 
 Net revenues of 3,045 million in the current quarter and 8,905 million in the current year period increased 21 and 14 , respectively, compared with the prior year periods, reflecting an increase in both Execution services and Financing, particularly in the Americas and Asia. 
 Financing revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity and lower funding and liquidity costs. 
 Execution services revenues increased primarily due to higher gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity, higher client activity in derivatives and cash equities and mark-to-market gains on business-related investments. 
 Fixed Income 
 Net revenues of 2,003 million in the current quarter increased 3 from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in Global macro products, partially offset by a decrease in Commodities. 
 Global macro products revenues increased primarily due to improved results in rates products in a changing rate 

environment driven by central bank activities and gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity in foreign exchange products. 
 Credit products revenues were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter. 
 Commodities products and other fixed income revenues decreased primarily due to lower gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity and decreased client activity compared to elevated results in the prior year quarter, which benefited from higher volatility in energy markets. 
 Net revenues of 6,487 million in the current year period increased 4 compared with the prior year period, reflecting an increase in Global macro and Credit products, partially offset by a decrease in Commodities. 
 Global macro products revenues increased primarily due to gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity in foreign exchange and rates products. 
 Credit products revenues increased primarily due to higher gains on inventory held to facilitate client activity and increased client activity in securitized products. 
 Commodities products and other fixed income revenues decreased primarily due to decreased client activity compared to elevated results in the prior year quarter, which benefited from higher volatility in energy markets. 
 Other Net Revenues 
 Other net revenues were 304 million in the current quarter, compared with 277 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains compared with losses in the prior year quarter on DCP investments and higher contributions from our Japanese securities joint venture, partially offset by higher mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, inclusive of hedges. 
 Other net revenues were 892 million in the current year period compared with 837 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans, higher mark-to-market gains on DCP investments and higher contributions from our Japanese securities joint venture, partially offset by higher mark-to-market losses on corporate loans, inclusive of hedges. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 68 million in the current quarter was primarily related to growth across loan portfolios and provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 93 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 
 The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 124 million in the current year period was

primarily related to growth across loan portfolios and provisions for certain specific commercial real estate loans. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was 379 million in the prior year period, primarily related to credit deterioration in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. 
 For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see Credit Risk herein. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Non-interest expenses of 4,836 million in the current quarter increased 10 compared with the prior year quarter as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses and Compensation and benefits expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation on higher revenues and higher expenses related to DCP. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased primarily reflecting higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend. 
 Non-interest expenses of 14,381 million in the current year period increased 5 compared with the prior year period as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses and Compensation and benefits expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation on higher revenues, partially offset by lower severance costs and lower expenses related to outstanding deferred equity compensation. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to higher execution-related expenses and increased technology spend, partially offset by lower legal expenses.

 Net Revenues 
 Asset Management 
 Asset management revenues of 4,266 million in the current quarter and 12,084 million in the current year period increased 18 and 15 , respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily reflecting higher fee-based asset levels due to higher market levels and the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows. 
 See Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards herein. 
 Transactional Revenues 
 Transactional revenues of 1,076 million in the current quarter and 2,891 million in the current year period increased 59 and 17 , respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily driven by gains on DCP investments and higher client activity. 
 For further information on the impact of DCP, see Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information herein. 

Net Interest 
 Net interest revenues of 1,774 million in the current quarter and 5,428 million in the current year period decreased 9 and 13 , respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily due to lower average sweep deposits, partially offset by higher yields on our investment portfolio and lending growth. 
 The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors have impacted client preferences for cash allocation to higher-yielding products and client demand for loans. These factors, along with other developments, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income and to the extent they persist, or others arise, such as further interest rate reductions, net interest income may be further impacted in future periods. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 11 million in the current quarter was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate loans, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 41 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 
 
 The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 25 million in the current year period was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate and securities-based loans, and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. In the prior year period, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of 150 million was primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Non-interest expenses of 5,199 million in the current quarter increased 12 , compared with the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher expenses related to DCP. 
 
 Non-compensation expense increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting increased technology spend, higher marketing and business development costs, and higher legal expenses, partially offset by lower professional services expenses. 

September 2024 Form 10-Q 15 

Table of Contents 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest expenses of 15,230 million in the current year period increased 6 , compared with the prior year period, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses increased from the prior year period, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher expenses related to DCP, partially offset by lower severance costs. 
 
 Non-compensation expense decreased from the prior year period, primarily due to the absence of integration-related expenses in the current year period and lower other professional services expenses, partially offset by increased technology spend.

 Net Revenues 
 Asset Management and Related Fees 
 
 Asset management and related fees of 1,384 million in the current quarter and 4,072 million in the current year period increased 5 and 6 , respectively, from the prior year periods, primarily driven by higher average AUM on higher market levels from the prior periods. 
 
 Asset management revenues are influenced by the level, relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. While higher market levels drove increases in average AUM in the current quarter, we have continued to see net outflows in the Equity asset class, which may be influenced by the performance of our products relative to their benchmarks, offset by higher net 

inflows in the Alternatives and Solutions and Fixed Income asset classes reflecting client preferences. To the extent these conditions continue, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be impacted. 
 See Assets under Management or Supervision herein. 
 Performance-based Income and Other 
 Performance-based income and other revenues of 71 million in the current quarter increased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher revenues from DCP investments and higher accrued carried interest in infrastructure and real estate funds, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds. 
 Performance-based income and other revenues of 146 million in the current year period increased from the prior year period, primarily due to higher accrued carried interest in infrastructure and real estate funds and higher revenues from DCP investments, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds. 
 Non-interest Expenses 
 Non-interest expenses of 1,195 million in the current quarter increased 9 from the prior year quarter, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to DCP and compensation associated with carried interest. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM and increased technology and infrastructure spend. 
 Non-interest expenses of 3,495 million in the current year period increased 5 from the prior year period, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher compensation associated with carried interest and higher discretionary incentive compensation. 
 Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM and increased technology and infrastructure spend.

 1. Inflows represent investments or commitments from new and existing clients in new or existing investment products, including reinvestments of client dividends and increases in invested capital. Inflows exclude the impact of exchanges, whereby a client changes positions within the same asset class. 
 2. Outflows represent redemptions from clients funds, transition of funds from the committed capital period to the invested capital period and decreases in invested capital. Outflows exclude the impact of exchanges, whereby a client changes positions within the same asset class. 
 3. Market impact includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on portfolio investments. This excludes any funds where market impact does not impact management fees. 
 4. Other contains both distributions and foreign currency impact for all periods. Distributions represent decreases in invested capital due to returns of capital after the investment period of a fund. It also includes fund dividends that the client has not reinvested. Foreign currency impact reflects foreign currency changes for non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. 
 5. In 2023, our Retail Municipal and Corporate Fixed Income business FIMS was combined with our Parametric retail customized solutions business. The impact of the change was a 6 billion movement in AUM from Fixed Income to the Alternatives and Solutions asset class included in Other.

 Accounting Development Updates 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

We are currently evaluating the following accounting updates; however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 
 
 Income Tax Disclosures. This accounting update requires disclosure of additional information in relation to income taxes, including additional disaggregation of the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. For the income tax rate reconciliation, this update requires (1) disclosure of specific categories of reconciling items; and (2) additional information for reconciling items that are greater than or equal to 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). For income taxes paid, this update requires disclosure of information, including (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes; and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Additionally, the update requires disclosure of (1) income (or loss) before income taxes, disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (2) income taxes disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. The accounting update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 
 
 Segment Reporting. This accounting update requires additional reportable segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, primarily about significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss. This update does not change how operating segments are identified or aggregated, or how quantitative thresholds are applied to determine the reportable segments. The accounting update is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and our Board of Directors Board ). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Corporate Treasury department Treasury ), Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board. 
 
 Balance Sheet 
 We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 
 We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business segment needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

 A substantial portion of total assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables. In the Institutional Securities business segment, these arise from market-making, financing and prime brokerage activities, and in the Wealth Management business segment, these arise from banking activities, including management of the investment portfolio. Total assets increased to 1,258 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 1,194 at December 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity Risk Management Framework 
 The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. For a further discussion about the Firm s Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Risk Management Framework in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 
 Liquidity Resources 
 We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks Liquidity Resources ), to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. We actively manage the amount of our Liquidity Resources considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements.

The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk appetite and is calibrated to meet various internal and regulatory requirements and to fund prospective business activities. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

 Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt, and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. 
 Regulatory Liquidity Framework 
 Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio 
 We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100 . 
 The LCR rule requires large banking organizations to have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising 

from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. 
 The NSFR rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is their regulatory capital and liabilities subject to standardized weightings, equal to or greater than their required stable funding, which is their projected minimum funding needs, over a one-year time horizon. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100 .

 1. Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. 
 
 Funding Management 
 We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. 
 We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, bank notes, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. 
 Treasury allocates interest expense to our businesses based on the tenor and interest rate profile of the assets being funded. Treasury similarly allocates interest income to businesses carrying deposit products and other liabilities across the businesses based on the characteristics of those deposits and other liabilities.

 3. Our deposits are primarily held in U.S. offices. 
 Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics relative to other sources of funding. Each category of deposits presented above has a different cost profile and clients may respond differently to changes in interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions. Total deposits in the current year period increased as a result of an increase in Time deposits and Savings and other deposits, partially offset by lower Brokerage sweep deposits, largely due to net outflows to alternative cash equivalent and other investment products.

 2. Includes only borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. 
 Borrowings of 298 billion as of September 30, 2024 increased when compared with 264 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to issuances net of maturities and redemptions. 
 We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.

and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities. 
 For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements. 
 Credit Ratings 
 We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. See also Risk Factors Liquidity Risk in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 
 In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 
 While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future 

periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency before the downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 
 Capital Management 
 We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements, such as the SCB, and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

 Regulatory Requirements 
 Regulatory Capital Framework 
 We are a financial holding company FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHC Act and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve ). The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that are swap entities, see Note 15 to the financial statements. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For more information, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Capital Requirements in the 2023 Form 10-K. For additional information on TLAC, see Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements herein. 
 Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus our capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments 

to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.

 2. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Regulatory Requirements G-SIB Capital Surcharge in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 3. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5 , but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at zero. 
 The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of CET1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Our capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market RWAs Standardized Approach is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs Advanced Approach is equal to our 2.5 capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.

 Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of (i) the Standardized Approach and (ii) the Advanced Approach. The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights and exposure methodologies, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach. 
 Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 , a minimum SLR of 3 and an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2 .

CECL Deferral. Beginning on January 1, 2020, we elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as our RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25 per year from January 1, 2022 and are phased-in at 75 from January 1, 2024. The deferral impacts will become fully phased-in beginning on January 1, 2025.

 Regulatory VaR VaR for regulatory capital requirements 
 
 In the current year period, Credit risk RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Under the Standardized Approach, the increase was primarily due to increased exposure in Securities financing transactions, Corporate lending and Other credit risk driven by higher securitizations. Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily due to increased exposure in Corporate lending, Derivatives, Securities financing transactions and Other credit risk driven by higher securitizations. 
 
 Market risk RWA increased in the current year period under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily driven by higher Specific risk charges on non-securitization standardized charges and higher Regulatory Stressed VaR. 
 
 The increase in Operational risk RWA in the current year period is related to legal expenses and execution losses.

 The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt LTD and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs covered BHCs ), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise

 Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer 
 The Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve s annual CCAR framework. 
 We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than 250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements. 
 As part of its annual capital supervisory stress testing process, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB for each large BHC, including us. 
 Our SCB remained at 5.4 through September 30, 2024. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB resulted in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 required ratio of 12.9 . 
 For the 2024 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2024. On June 26, 2024, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its

supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, in which the projected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario increased from the prior annual supervisory stress test by 50 basis points, from 4.1 to 4.6 . Following the publication of the supervisory stress test results, we announced that our SCB will be 6.0 from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. In addition to the projected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario, our SCB reflects the increase in our common stock dividend in the dividend add-on. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.5 . Generally, our SCB is determined annually based on the results of the supervisory stress test. 
 
 We also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website and increased our quarterly common stock dividend to 0.925 per share from 0.85, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 16, 2024.

 Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 
 Our required capital Required Capital estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 
 The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs e.g ., acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company common equity. We generally hold Parent Company common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.

 We continue to evaluate our Required Capital framework with respect to the impact of evolving regulatory requirements, as appropriate. 
 Resolution and Recovery Planning 
 We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC Agencies a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. We submitted our 2023 full resolution plan on June 30, 2023. In June 2024, we received joint feedback on our 2023 resolution plan from the Agencies, with no shortcomings or deficiencies identified. 
 As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the Funding IHC ). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its contributable assets to our supported entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our supported entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support.

Regulatory Developments and Other Matters 
 FDIC Final Rulemaking on Insured Depository Institution Resolution Plans 
 
 On June 20, 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the required cadence and informational content of covered insured depository institution IDI resolution plan submissions, which describe the IDI's strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of the IDI. As a result of the final rule, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries will be required to submit full resolution plans every two years and interim targeted information at certain times between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, the new rule introduces a new credibility standard that will be used to evaluate full resolution plan submissions, which would be subject to FDIC enforcement action. The final rule is effective beginning October 1, 2024, and the first submission for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under the new rule will be in 2026. For more information on our resolution plan-related submissions and associated regulatory actions, see Business Supervision and Regulation Financial Holding Company Resolution and Recovery Planning in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 FDIC Final Rulemaking on Special Assessment 
 
 Following the failures of certain banks and resulting losses to the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund in the first half of 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule on November 16, 2023 to implement a special assessment to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors. We recorded the cost of the special assessment of 286 million in Non-interest expenses when the final rule was published in the Federal Register, in the fourth quarter of 2023. We recorded the incremental estimated cost of 40 million during the first nine months of 2024 based on subsequent notifications received from the FDIC which contained the revised estimated net losses from those bank failures. 
 Basel III Endgame and G-SIB Surcharge Proposals

 Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds. For a further discussion of market risk, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Market Risk in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Trading Risks 
 We have exposures to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities, correlations and spreads of the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities. 
 The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. 
 For information regarding our primary risk exposures and market risk management, VaR methodology, assumptions and limitations, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk Market Risk Trading Risks in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 1. The high and low VaR values for the Total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and, therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure. 
 2. Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days. Similar diversification benefits are also are taken into account within each component. 
 
 Average Total Management VaR and average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories decreased slightly from the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven by reduced exposures in the interest rate and credit spread category, partially offset by lower diversification benefit. 
 Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues 
 We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model s accuracy. There were no trading loss days in the current quarter.

Revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading.

 The Wealth Management business segment reflects a substantial portion of our non-trading interest rate risk. Net interest income in the Wealth Management business segment primarily consists of interest income earned on non-trading assets held, including loans and investment securities, as well as margin and other lending on non-bank entities and interest expense incurred on non-trading liabilities, primarily deposits.

 The previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks (subject to a floor of zero percent in the downward scenario) on net interest income over the next 12 months for our Wealth Management business segment. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our Wealth Management business segment, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted balance sheet and business activity. The forecast includes modeled prepayment behavior, reinvestment of net cash flows from maturing assets and liabilities, and deposit pricing sensitivity to interest rates. These key assumptions are updated periodically based on historical data and future expectations. 
 We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our Wealth Management business segment across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors.

 Risk Disclosures 

Our Wealth Management business segment balance sheet is asset sensitive, given assets reprice faster than liabilities, resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios and lower net interest income in declining interest rate scenarios. The level of interest rates may impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm, given competition for deposits from other institutions and alternative cash-equivalent products available to depositors. Further, the level of interest rates could also impact client demand for loans. 
 Net interest income sensitivity to interest rates at September 30, 2024 decreased from June 30, 2024, primarily driven by the effect of changes in the mix of our assets and liabilities.

 We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a reasonably possible 10 decline in investment values and related impact on performance-based income, as applicable 
 Asset Management Revenue Sensitivity 
 Certain asset management revenues in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments are derived from management fees, which are based on fee-based client assets in Wealth Management or AUM in Investment Management (together, client holdings ). The assets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of equity, fixed income and alternative investments and are sensitive to changes in related markets. These revenues depend on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, and client behavior such as the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions. Therefore, overall revenues may not correlate completely with changes in the related markets. 

Credit Risk 
 Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.

 2. Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment adviser and manager. Loans held at fair value are the result of the consolidation of investment vehicles (including CLOs) managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured loans to corporations. 
 3. Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, including large corporate and institutional clients, as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately 33 billion since December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in Corporate lending commitments and Secured lending facilities within the Institutional Securities business segment, and growth across portfolios within the Wealth Management business segment.

 Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments include the borrower s financial strength, industry, facility structure, LTV ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered. 

The allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments was relatively unchanged since December 31, 2023, reflecting provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and growth across certain loan portfolios, offset by charge-offs and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. 
 The base scenario used in our ACL models as of September 30, 2024 was generated using a combination of consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. This scenario assumes modest economic growth in 2024, followed by a gradual improvement in 2025 as well as lower interest rates relative to the prior quarter forecast. The ACL calculation incorporates key macroeconomic variables, including U.S. real GDP growth rate. The significance of key macroeconomic variables on the ACL calculation varies depending on portfolio composition and economic conditions.

 The current economic environment and changes in business and consumer behavior have adversely impacted commercial real estate borrowers due to pressure from higher interest rates, tenant lease renewals, and elevated refinancing risks for loans with near-term maturities, among other issues. While we continue to actively monitor all our loan portfolios, the commercial real estate sector remains under heightened focus given the sector s sensitivity to economic and secular factors, credit conditions, and difficulties specific to certain property types, most notably office. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , our lending against commercial real estate CRE properties within the Institutional Securities business segment totaled 10.3 billion and 9.4 billion, respectively. This represents 4.4 and 4.5 , respectively, of total exposure reflected in the Institutional 

Securities Loans and Lending Commitments table above. Those CRE loans are originated for experienced sponsors and are generally secured by specific institutional CRE properties. In many cases, loans are subsequently syndicated or s ecuritized on a full or partial basis, reducing our ongoing exposure. 
 In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we provide certain secured lending facilities which are typically collateralized by pooled CRE mortgage loans and are included in Secured lending facilities in the Institutional Securities Loans and Lending Commitments Held for Investment table above.

 Securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, generally for any purpose other than purchasing, trading or carrying securities or refinancing margin debt. Other loans primarily include tailored lending, which typically consist of bespoke lending arrangements provided to ultra-high net worth clients. Securities-based lending and Other loans are generally secured by various types of eligible collateral, including marketable securities, private investments, commercial real estate and other financial assets.

 The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments provide margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as well as to collateralize short positions. Institutional Securities primarily includes margin loans in the Equity Financing business. Wealth Management includes margin loans as well as non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities. Amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage. 
 Credit exposures arising from margin lending activities are generally mitigated by their short-term nature, the value of collateral held and our right to call for additional margin when

collateral values decline. However, we could incur losses in the event that the customer fails to meet margin calls and collateral values decline below the loan amount. This risk is elevated in loans backed by collateral pools with significant concentrations in individual issuers or securities with similar risk characteristics.

 Model Risk 
 Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making or damage to our reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley: 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the Firm as of September 30, 2024, and the related condensed consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements and statements of changes in total equity for the three-month and nine-month ended periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the cash flow statements for the nine-month ended periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated income statement, comprehensive income statement, cash flow statement and statement of changes in total equity for the year then ended (not presented herein) included in the Firm s Annual Report on Form 10-K; and in our report dated February 22, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

Basis for Review Results 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Firm s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 The allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments was relatively unchanged for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and growth across certain loan portfolios, offset by charge-offs and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The base scenario used in our ACL models as of September 30, 2024 was generated using a combination of consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. This scenario assumes modest economic growth in 2024, followed by a gradual improvement in 2025 as well as lower interest rates relative to the prior quarter forecast. The ACL calculation incorporates key macroeconomic variables, including U.S. real GDP growth rate. The significance of key macroeconomic variables on the ACL calculation varies depending on portfolio composition and economic conditions. Other key macroeconomic variables used in the ACL calculation include corporate credit spreads, interest rates and commercial real estate indices.

 The OCC establishes capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm s regulatory capital requirements, although G-SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. 
 The OCC s regulatory capital framework includes Prompt Corrective Action PCA standards, including well-capitalized PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC s PCA standards. In addition, 

failure by the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries and the Firm s financial statements. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MSBNA and MSPBNA risk-based capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules. Beginning on January 1, 2020, MSBNA and MSPBNA elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on risk-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25 per year from January 1, 2022 and are phased-in at 75 from January 1, 2024. The deferral impacts will become fully phased-in beginning on January 1, 2025.

 Additionally, MSBNA is conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer. However, as MSBNA is prudentially regulated as a bank, its capital requirements continue to be determined by the OCC.
