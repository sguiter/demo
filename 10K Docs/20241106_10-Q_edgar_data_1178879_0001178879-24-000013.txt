SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are all statements, other than statements of historical facts, that discuss our current expectation and projections relating to our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans, and objectives of management. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words "aim," "anticipate," "believe," "can," "could," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "intend," "likely," "may," "might," "outlook," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "seek," "should," "will," "would," the negatives or plurals thereof, and other words and terms of similar meaning, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 
 We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Although we believe that our assumptions made in connection with the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the assumptions and expectations will prove to be correct. You should understand that the following important factors could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of clinical trials for our drug candidates; 
 the cost of manufacturing drug supply for our commercial, clinical and preclinical studies, including the cost of manufacturing Pombiliti (also referred to as "ATB200" or "cipaglucosidase alfa"); 
 the future results of preclinical research and subsequent clinical trials for pipeline candidates we may identify from time to time, including our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize such therapies; 
 the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 
 any changes in regulatory standards relating to the review of our product candidates; 
 any changes in laws, rules or regulations affecting our ability to manufacture, transport, test, develop, or commercialize our products, including Galafold , Pombiliti + Opfolda , or our product candidates; 
 the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales, and distribution; 
 the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments; 
 the estimates regarding the potential market opportunity for our products and product candidates; 
 our ability to successfully commercialize Galafold (also referred to as "migalastat HCl"); 
 our ability to successfully commercialize Pombiliti + Opfolda (together, also referred to as "AT-GAA") in the E.U., U.K., U.S., Switzerland and elsewhere, if regulatory applications are approved; 
 our ability to manufacture or supply sufficient clinical or commercial products, including Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda 
 our ability to obtain reimbursement for Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda 
 our ability to satisfy post-marketing commitments or requirements for continued regulatory approval of Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda 
 our ability to obtain market acceptance of Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda , or any other product developed or acquired that has received regulatory approval; 
 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing, and defending intellectual property-related claims, including Hatch-Waxman litigation; 
 the impact of litigation that has been or may be brought against us or of litigation that we are pursuing or may pursue against others, including Hatch-Waxman litigation; 
 the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, and technologies; 
 our ability to successfully integrate acquired products and technologies into our business, or successfully divest or license existing products and technologies from our business, including the possibility that the expected benefits of the transactions will not be fully realized by us or may take longer to realize than expected; 
 our ability to establish licensing agreements, collaborations, partnerships or other similar arrangements and to obtain milestone, royalty, or other economic benefits from any such collaborators; 
 1 

the costs associated with, and our ability to comply with, emerging environmental, social and governance standards, including climate reporting requirements at the local, state and national levels; 
 our ability to successfully protect our information technology systems and maintain our global operations and supply chain without interruption; 
 our ability to accurately forecast revenue, operating expenditures, or other metrics impacting profitability; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 
 changes in accounting standards. 
 In light of these risks and uncertainties, we may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions, and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that we believe could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Those factors and the other risk factors described herein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future collaborations, alliances, business combinations, partnerships, strategic out-licensing of certain assets, the acquisition of preclinical-stage, clinical-stage, marketed products or platform technologies or other investments we may make. Consequently, there can be no assurance that actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us. Given these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation, and specifically decline any obligation, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, even if experience or future developments make it clear that projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized, except as may be required by law.

 billion as of September 30, 2024 and anticipates incurring losses through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Company has historically funded its operations through stock offerings, product revenues, debt issuances, collaborations, and other financing arrangements. 
 Based on its current operating model, which includes expected revenues, the Company believes the current cash position is sufficient to fund the Company's operations and ongoing research programs for at least the next 12 months. Potential business development opportunities, pipeline expansion, and investment in manufacturing capabilities could impact the Company's long-term capital requirements.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses." The standard is intended to require more detailed disclosures about specified categories of expenses (including employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization) included in certain expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

 million in cash and cash equivalents and million of marketable securities which are reported at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized holding gains and losses are generally reported within other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). If a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below the Company's cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary or if an available-for-sale debt security s fair value is determined to be less than the amortized cost and the Company intends or is more than likely to sell the security before recovery and it is not considered a credit loss, such security is written down to its estimated fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an impairment charge. If the unrealized loss of an available-for-sale debt security is determined to be a result of credit loss, the Company would recognize an allowance and the corresponding credit loss would be included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The Company regularly invests excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions, money market funds, notes issued by the U.S. government, as well as fixed income investments and U.S. bond funds, both of which can be readily purchased and sold using established markets. The Company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of these financial instruments is mitigated as, in accordance with Company policy, such securities are of high credit rating. Investments that have original maturities greater than three months but less than one year are classified as current.

 There were no unrealized loss positions as of September 30, 2024. Unrealized loss positions in the marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 reflect temporary impairments and are not a result of credit loss. Additionally, as these positions have been in a loss position for less than twelve months and the Company does not intend to sell these securities before recovery, the losses are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Some of the statements we make in this section are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements . Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 entitled Risk Factors . 
 Overview 
 We are a global, patient-dedicated biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and delivering novel medicines for rare diseases. We seek to deliver the highest quality therapies that have the potential to obsolete current treatments, provide significant benefits to patients, and be first- or best-in-class. Our two marketed therapies are Galafold , the first oral monotherapy for people living with Fabry disease who have amenable genetic variants, and Pombiliti + Opfolda , a novel two-component treatment designed to improve uptake of active enzyme into key disease relevant tissues for adults living with late-onset Pompe disease. 
 Galafold (also referred to as "migalastat") is approved in over 40 countries around the world, including the United States ("U.S."), European Union ("E.U."), United Kingdom ("U.K."), and Japan. Additionally, Galafold has been granted orphan drug status in the U.S., E.U., U.K., Japan and several other countries. 
 Pombiliti + Opfolda (also referred to as "cipaglucosidase alfa-atga/miglustat") is approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., and Switzerland. Multiple regulatory submissions and reimbursement processes with global health authorities are currently underway. Additionally, Pombiliti + Opfolda has been granted orphan drug designation or status in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Japan and data exclusivity in the E.U. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to create, manufacture, test, and deliver the highest quality medicines for people living with rare diseases through internally developed, jointly developed, acquired, or in-licensed products and product candidates. We are leveraging our global capabilities to develop and broaden our franchises in Fabry and Pompe disease, with focused discovery work on next generation therapies and novel technologies. 
 Highlights of our progress include: 
 Commercial success in Fabry disease. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Galafold revenue was 330.6 million of consolidated revenue, which represented an increase of 49.4 million compared the same period in the prior year. We continue to see strong commercial momentum and expansion into additional geographies. 
 Commercial and regulatory success in Pompe disease. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pombiliti + Opfolda revenue was 48.0 million of consolidated revenue. Pombiliti + Opfolda was approved by the European Commission ("EC") in June 2023, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA)" of the United Kingdom in August 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in September 2023, and the Swissmedic of Switzerland in July 2024. 
 Pipeline advancement and growth. We are leveraging our global capabilities to develop and broaden our franchises in Fabry and Pompe disease, with focused discovery work on next generation therapies and novel technologies. 
 Financial strength . Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 was 249.8 million.

Our Commercial Products and Product Candidates 
 Galafold (migalastat HCl) for Fabry Disease 
 Our oral precision medicine, Galafold , was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in August 2018 for the treatment of adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable galactosidase alpha gene ("GLA") variant based on in vitro assay data. Galafold was approved in the E.U. and U.K. in May 2016 as a first-line therapy for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents, aged 16 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and who have an amenable variant. Marketing authorization approvals as well as approvals for adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing 45 kg or more have been granted in over 40 countries around the world. We plan to continue to launch Galafold in additional countries upon receipt of marketing authorization. 
 As an orally administered monotherapy, Galafold is designed to bind to and stabilize an endogenous alpha-galactosidase A ("alpha-Gal A") enzyme in those patients with genetic variants identified as amenable in a Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP") cell-based amenability assay. 
 Pombiliti (cipaglucosidase alfa-atga) + Opfolda (miglustat) for Pompe Disease 
 We have leveraged our biologics capabilities to develop Pombiliti + Opfolda , a novel treatment paradigm for Pompe disease. Pombiliti + Opfolda was approved by the EC in June 2023, the MHRA in August 2023, the FDA in September 2023, and the Swissmedic in July 2024 for adult late-onset Pompe disease ("LOPD") patients. Additional regulatory submissions and reimbursement processes with global health authorities are currently underway. 
 Pombiliti + Opfolda consists of a uniquely engineered rhGAA enzyme, cipaglucosidase alfa-atga, with an optimized carbohydrate structure to enhance cellular uptake, administered intravenously in combination with orally administered miglustat. Miglustat binds to and stabilizes the cipaglucosidase alfa-atga in circulation reducing inactivation of rhGAA to improve the uptake of active enzyme into key disease relevant tissues. Miglustat is not an active ingredient that contributes directly to glycogen reduction. 
 In addition, clinical studies are ongoing in pediatric patients for both the LOPD and infantile-onset Pompe disease ("IOPD") populations. 
 Next Generation Therapies 
 We are committed to continued innovation for all people living with Fabry or Pompe disease. As part of our long-term commitment, we are continuing discovery efforts for next-generation genetic medicines for Fabry and Pompe disease. 
 Strategic Alliances and Arrangements 
 We will continue to evaluate business development opportunities to build stockholder value and provide us with access to the financial, technical, clinical, commercial resources, and intellectual property necessary to develop and market technologies or products in rare and orphan diseases. We are exploring potential collaborations, alliances, and various other business development opportunities on a regular basis. These opportunities may include business combinations, partnerships, the strategic out-licensing of certain assets, or the acquisition of preclinical-stage, clinical-stage, or marketed products or novel technologies consistent with our corporate strategy to develop and provide therapies to patients living with rare and orphan diseases.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 
 The following table provides selected financial information for the Company: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net product sales 141,517 103,501 38,016 Cost of goods sold 13,279 9,946 3,333 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales 9.4 9.6 (0.2) Operating expenses: Research and development 26,160 40,704 (14,544) Selling, general, and administrative 75,106 65,651 9,455 Changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable 1,995 (1,995) Restructuring charges 3,143 3,143 Depreciation and amortization 2,170 2,228 (58) Other expense: Interest income 1,081 1,471 (390) Interest expense (12,692) (12,986) 294 Other (expense) income (3,263) 3,833 (7,096) Income tax (expense) benefit (13,514) 3,128 (16,642) Net loss attributable to common stockholders (6,729) (21,577) 14,848 
 Net Product Sales. Net product sales increased 38.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to both the continued growth of Galafold in Europe and the U.S. as well as the launch of Pombiliti + Opfolda in Europe and the U.S., and a 0.8 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 
 Research and Development Expense. The following table summarizes our principal development programs and the out-of-pocket, third-party expenses incurred: 
 (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Projects 2024 2023 Third party direct project expenses Galafold (Fabry Disease) 
 2,380 4,505 Pombiliti + Opfolda (Pompe Disease) 
 10,590 15,233 Pre-clinical and other programs 646 1,753 Total third-party direct project expenses 13,616 21,491 Other project costs Personnel costs 9,707 15,194 Other costs 2,837 4,019 Total other project costs 12,544 19,213 Total research and development costs 26,160 40,704 
 The 14.5 million decrease in research and development costs was primarily driven by our Pombiliti + Opfolda commercial launch, decreasing both clinical spend and the number of employees supporting research and development efforts. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased 9.5 million, primarily driven by personnel costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees to support our commercial launch activities and third party professional fees. 
 21 

Other (Expense) Income . The decrease of 7.1 million was primarily related to movement in foreign exchange rates caused by remeasurement of foreign-denominated balances. 
 Income Tax Expense . We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are largely dependent on the mix of pre-tax earnings among the many jurisdictions in which we operate and differences in the timing of the recognition of such earnings under the relevant accounting standards and tax rules. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 
 The following table provides selected financial information for the Company: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net product sales 378,589 284,274 94,315 Cost of goods sold 38,107 26,002 12,105 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales 10.1 9.1 1.0 Operating expenses: Research and development 79,172 117,352 (38,180) Selling, general, and administrative 236,711 205,031 31,680 Changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable 2,583 (2,583) Restructuring charges 9,188 9,188 Loss on impairment of assets 1,134 (1,134) Depreciation and amortization 6,506 5,691 815 Other expense: Interest income 3,991 5,407 (1,416) Interest expense (37,640) (37,322) (318) Other expense (11,946) (13,007) 1,061 Income tax (expense) benefit (34,155) 700 (34,855) Net loss attributable to common stockholders (70,845) (117,741) 46,896 
 Net Product Sales. Net product sales increased 94.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to both the continued growth of Galafold in Europe and the U.S. as well as the launch of Pombiliti + Opfolda in Europe and the U.S., partially offset by the 0.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange. 
 22 

Cost of goods sold . Cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs as well as royalties associated with net product sales. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales increased 1.0 primarily due to inventory write-offs associated with validation efforts in the current period. 
 Research and Development Expense. The following table summarizes our principal development programs and the out-of-pocket, third-party expenses incurred: 
 (in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, Projects 2024 2023 Third party direct project expenses Galafold (Fabry Disease) 
 6,420 10,971 Pombiliti + Opfolda (Pompe Disease) 
 31,003 44,126 Pre-clinical and other programs 2,095 3,218 Total third-party direct project expenses 39,518 58,315 Other project costs Personnel costs 31,287 47,108 Other costs 8,367 11,929 Total other project costs 39,654 59,037 Total research and development costs 79,172 117,352 
 The 38.2 million decrease in research and development costs was primarily driven by our Pombiliti + Opfolda commercial launch, decreasing both clinical spend and the number of employees supporting research and development efforts. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expense. Selling, general, and administrative expense increased 31.7 million, primarily driven by personnel costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees to support our commercial launch activities, external costs required to support the manufacture and sale of our commercial products, and third-party professional fees. 
 Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges were primarily related to an initiative to reduce operating costs by abandoning a lease that we no longer believe is useful in our operations. 
 Income Tax Expense . We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are largely dependent on the mix of pre-tax earnings among the many jurisdictions in which we operate and differences in the timing of the recognition of such earnings under the relevant accounting standards and tax rules. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As a result of our significant research and development expenditures, as well as expenditures to build a commercial organization to support the launch of Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda , we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in 2002. We have historically funded our operations through stock offerings, product revenues, debt issuance, collaborations, and other financing arrangements. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 In November 2022, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC to create an at-the-market equity program ("ATM program"), pursuant to which we may offer to sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering gross proceeds of up to 250.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, an aggregate of 164.7 million worth of shares remain available to be issued and sold under the ATM program. 
 23 

Cash Flow Discussion 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 249.8 million. We invest cash in excess of our immediate requirements in regard to liquidity and capital preservation in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including obligations of U.S. government agencies and money market accounts. Wherever possible, we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk. Although we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits, we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. For more details on the cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, refer to " Note 3. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash," in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.0 million. The components of net cash used in operations included the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 70.8 million and a net decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of 55.2 million offset by 65.7 million of stock compensation and 30.4 million of other non-cash adjustments. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in inventory of 61.6 million to support our continued commercial growth and an increase in accounts receivable of 9.1 million , partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 28.2 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 11.5 million associated with timing of payments. 
 Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 72.5 million . The components of net cash used in operations included the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 117.7 million offset by 68.0 million of stock compensation, 25.9 million of other non-cash adjustments, and a net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities of 48.7 million . The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in inventory of 42.2 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 26.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 41.1 million associated with Pombiliti + Opfolda launch activities and increases in sales rebates associated with increased commercial sales of Galafold . 
 Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.8 million. Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, sales, and maturities of investments and capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities reflects 101.9 million from the sale and redemption of marketable securities, partially offset by 78.8 million for the purchase of marketable securities and 3.3 million for capital expenditures. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 122.0 million. Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, sales and maturities of investments and capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities reflects 180.8 million from the sale and redemption of marketable securities, partially offset by 53.1 million for the purchase of marketable securities and 5.7 million for capital expenditures. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects 19.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with the ATM program offering, net of issuance costs, and 6.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the withholding taxes paid on vested restricted stock unites of 21.2 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 53.5 million. Net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects 63.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of shares in connection with the ATM program offering, net of issuance costs, and 7.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the withholding taxes paid on vested restricted stock units of 16.4 million. 
 24 

Funding Requirements 
 We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development expenses, including expenses related to conducting clinical trials. Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including: 
 the scope, progress, results and costs of clinical trials for our drug candidates; 
 the cost of manufacturing drug supply for our commercial, clinical and preclinical studies, including the cost of manufacturing Pombiliti (also referred to as "ATB200" or "cipaglucosidase alfa"); 
 the future results of preclinical research and subsequent clinical trials for pipeline candidates we may identify from time to time, including our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize such therapies; 
 the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 
 any changes in regulatory standards relating to the review of our product candidates; 
 any changes in laws, rules or regulations affecting our ability to manufacture, transport, test, develop, or commercialize our products, including Galafold , Pombiliti + Opfolda , or our product candidates; 
 the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales, and distribution; 
 the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments; 
 the estimates regarding the potential market opportunity for our products and product candidates; 
 our ability to successfully commercialize Galafold (also referred to as "migalastat HCl"); 
 our ability to successfully commercialize Pombiliti + Opfolda (together, also referred to as "AT-GAA") in the E.U., U.K., and U.S., Switzerland and elsewhere, if regulatory applications are approved; 
 our ability to manufacture or supply sufficient clinical or commercial products, including Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda 
 our ability to obtain reimbursement for Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda 
 our ability to satisfy post-marketing commitments or requirements for continued regulatory approval of Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda 
 our ability to obtain market acceptance of Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda or any other product developed or acquired that has received regulatory approval; 
 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing, and defending intellectual property-related claims, including Hatch-Waxman litigation; 
 the impact of litigation that has been or may be brought against us or of litigation that we are pursuing or may pursue against others, including Hatch-Waxman litigation; 
 the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, and technologies; 
 our ability to successfully integrate our acquired products and technologies into our business, or successfully divest or license existing products and technologies from our business, including the possibility that the expected benefits of the transactions will not be fully realized by us or may take longer to realize than expected; 
 our ability to establish licensing agreements, collaborations, partnerships or other similar arrangements and to obtain milestone, royalty, or other economic benefits from any such collaborators; 
 the costs associated with, and our ability to comply with, emerging environmental, social and governance standards, including climate reporting requirements at the local, state and national levels; 
 our ability to successfully protect our information technology systems and maintain our global operations and supply chain without interruption; 
 our ability to accurately forecast revenue, operating expenditures, or other metrics impacting profitability; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 
 changes in accounting standards. 
 25 

We may seek additional funding through public or private financings of debt or equity. Based on our current operating model, which includes expected revenues, we believe that the current cash position is sufficient to fund our operations and ongoing research programs for at least the next 12 months. Potential impacts of business development collaborations, pipeline expansion, and investment in manufacturing capabilities could impact our long-term capital requirements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments and make changes when necessary. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There were no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the items that we disclosed as our significant accounting policies and estimates described in " Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Company's financial statements as contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our market risks, and the way we manage them, are summarized in Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our market risks or to our management of such risks since December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") was carried out under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, with the participation of our management. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 During the fiscal quarter covered by this report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ("Teva"), Aurobindo Pharma Limited ("Aurobindo"), and Lupin Limited ("Lupin") in connection with Abbreviated New Drug Applications ANDA filed with the FDA requesting approval to market generic Galafold . In November 2022, the Company filed four lawsuits against Teva, Lupin, and Aurobindo in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Court") for infringement of its Orange Book-listed patents. In the fourth quarter of 2023, a stipulation order to stay litigation with respect to Lupin was ordered. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, a stipulation was filed with the court and approved by the presiding judge, whereby the parties agreed to accept the Company s definition of the terms that were in dispute. As such, the scheduled Markman hearing was deemed unneeded and cancelled. 
 In October 2024, the Company entered into a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license with Teva which will allow Teva to market its generic version of Galafold in the United States beginning on January 30, 2037, or earlier in certain circumstances. In accordance with the license agreement, a consent judgment and permanent injunction was entered with the Court and all Hatch-Waxman litigation between Amicus and Teva has been terminated. As required by law, Amicus and Teva have submitted the confidential license agreement to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice for review. 
 The litigation will continue against Aurobindo as the remaining active party, and the litigation stay remains in place for Lupin. The Company has, and will continue to, vigorously enforce its Galafold intellectual property rights.
