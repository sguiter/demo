 million (subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments) using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Company s existing credit facility, which included repayment of approximately million of Antares debt. The total assets of Antares included approximately lots owned or controlled in the Dallas Fort Worth market. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.

Business Overview 
 
 Driven by a commitment to sustainability, we design and build homes and communities in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Metro New York, and Texas. We create inspired spaces for modern living and feature homes and communities in vibrant, prime locations which connect seamlessly with their surroundings and enhance the local lifestyle for living, working, and playing. The defining principle, Live in Your Element , creates the foundation for our customers to live where they want to live, how they want to live in a home created especially for them. 
 
 We are engaged in the acquisition, development, and sale of homes and lots in six states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New York, and Texas, which also comprise the Company s six reportable segments. We build and sell an extensive range of home types across a variety of price points, but we focus our efforts on the first-time homebuyer. Our Corporate operations are a non-operating segment that supports our homebuilding operations by providing executive, finance, treasury, human resources, accounting, and legal services. 
 
 In April 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Antares Acquisition, LLC Antares ), a Dallas Fort Worth based homebuilder, for approximately 239.8 million (subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments) using a combination of cash on hand and borrowing under the Company s existing credit facility, which included repayment of approximately 40.2 million of Antares debt. The Antares acquisition increased our presence in Texas with approximately 2,100 lots owned or controlled at the time of acquisition. We believe this acquisition fits with and continues to advance our overall business strategy by expanding into new and diverse markets. 
 
 In October 2023, the Company expanded into the Colorado market by acquiring certain assets of Richfield Homes, LLC Richfield ). The Company paid an aggregate cash purchase price of 22.5 million to acquire approximately 290 owned or controlled lots in the greater Denver, Colorado area, including any construction in progress on those lots. This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. We believe this acquisition fits with and continues to advance our overall business strategy by allowing us to expand into new geographic markets and to continue to shift inventory and product to more affordable offerings. 
 
 We manage inventory challenges by partnering with suppliers that can dedicate their attention and products to us, leveraging operational forecasts to assist in making purchase orders with sufficient lead time, using standard size products that are interchangeable, and holding select products on hand to ensure availability. In recent periods we have focused on being strategic in the contracts we enter into and the vendors we use. Over the last few quarters, we have seen improvements in our cycle time from beginning construction on a home to final delivery to the homebuyer. We believe these steps will allow us to continue to shorten our construction cycle time. Costs of construction have generally increased over recent quarters at a moderate pace. Higher construction costs to build our homes are primarily being driven by increased land costs in the markets we operate in and financing costs driven in large part by higher interest rates. 
 
 Sustained higher mortgage interest rates have amplified challenges to affordability for many potential homebuyers and put pressure on demand across the nation. While our absorption and cancellation rates have stabilized to a large extent as many homebuyers acclimated to a higher interest rate environment, continued inflation, and the potential for interest rates to remain high, continues to cause affordability concerns and market uncertainty. These concerns have continued to cause challenges across the homebuilding industry throughout 2024. Although we saw marginal relief in mortgage interest rates at the end of the third quarter of 2024, and expect rates to trend downward in coming quarters, there can be no assurance as to the direction, timing, and magnitude of any such movement. We expect future federal funds rate changes by the Federal Reserve to precede and ultimately drive mortgage interest rates changes. Those changes can significantly influence our absorption and cancellation rates. Even as rates show signs of easing, some homebuyers, anticipating further decreases in rates, may continue to delay purchasing a home. In light of these expectations, we are focusing our sales and marketing efforts on addressing affordability through a commitment to lower fixed interest rate incentive programs as well as providing purchase incentives, subject to managing our inventory levels in the market. We manage certain nationwide marketing programs, however incentives are specifically tailored to the circumstances of each community. We regularly perform stress tests on our backlog to identify homebuyers that are most likely to cancel their sales contracts, without intervention, due to higher costs from rising interest rates. 
 
 During 2024, we launched our exclusive financial services, Landsea Elements, which provides end-to-end support for our homebuyers through our existing services, Landsea Mortgage and Landsea Title, along with our newest offering, Landsea Insurance Agency. Through a licensing agreement, we partner with NFM Lending as a preferred lender to provide mortgage services under the name Landsea Mortgage. In connection with this arrangement, we have focused many of our incentives on mortgage interest rates and 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 22 

assisting homebuyers with buydowns on their home loans. This focus has helped achieve certain goals related to sales pace and absorption, but these additional discounts and incentives have lowered revenue and gross margins. We continue to monitor the credit worthiness of our homebuyers with NFM Lending with the objective of converting as many of our sales as possible into successful home deliveries. In addition to Landsea Mortgage, we offer title and insurance services through Landsea Title and Landsea Insurance Agency, respectively. Together we believe these offerings, bundled under the umbrella of Landsea Elements, provide significant value to potential homebuyers in facilitating the home buying process and additional opportunities for us to generate positive returns while managing and converting sales to deliveries with additional insights throughout the home buying process. 
 
 In March 2024, Landsea Holdings Corporation Landsea Holdings ), the Company s then-majority stockholder, completed an underwritten secondary offering of approximately 2.8 million shares of the Company s common stock. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by Landsea Holdings. The Company paid costs, fees, and expenses for the offering of 0.6 million. Immediately following completion of such sale by Landsea Holdings, the aggregate beneficial ownership of Landsea Holdings fell below 50 of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, we no longer qualify as a controlled company under The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC listing standards. In September 2024, Landsea Holdings ownership further decreased and was less than 25 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Strategy 
 
 Our strategy is focused on maximizing stockholder returns through profitability and efficiency, while balancing appropriate amounts of leverage. In general, we are focused on the following long-term strategic objectives: 
 
 Expand community count in current markets and enhance operating returns 
 Maintain an appropriate supply of lots 
 Continue to focus on entry-level product offerings 
 Strengthen unique brand position through product differentiation 
 Continue geographic expansion and diversification into new markets 
 Leverage existing sales, marketing, and general and administrative base to enhance stockholder returns and profitability 
 Become a top-ten homebuilder in the United States 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are defined as numerical measures of a company s performance that exclude or include amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 We present non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted home sales gross margin, net debt to total capital, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income in their respective sections below to enhance an investor s evaluation of the ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of the results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting. 

Summary Results of Operations 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, home sales revenue increased 31 to 1,036.4 million from 790.2 million and home deliveries increased 30 to 1,894 units from 1,459 units, in each case as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in home sales revenue and home deliveries year-over-year is primarily the result of improvements in our California and Arizona segments as well as the addition of Antares in our Texas segment and Richfield to begin our Colorado segment. The results were also impacted by the sale of model homes in June and July 2024 which we immediately leased back. The model home sales generated 64.9 million and 61.5 million in home sales revenue and cost of sales, respectively. These improvements were partially offset by challenges to affordability across all of our operating segments as mortgage interest rates remain high and more incentives are required to sustain demand. In total, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.4 million compared to 19.5 million in the corresponding prior year period. 
 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 23 

We remain focused on growth and view our ability to maintain optimal leverage ratios as a key factor in obtaining the financing required in order to expand. While we have grown organically and through acquisitions in recent years, we have been able to act on our strategy and be opportunistic about acquisitions and other growth opportunities. Our debt to capital ratio increased to 51.8 as of September 30, 2024 following the acquisition of Antares compared to 44.1 as of December 31, 2023. Our net debt to total capital ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure; see below for the definition and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure) increased to 49.2 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 30.4 as of December 31, 2023. We believe the continued strength of our balance sheet and operating platform position us well to continue to execute our growth strategy and are focused on reducing our leverage ratios over time. 
 
 We anticipate the homebuilding markets in each of our operating segments to be tied to both the local economy and the macro-economic environment. Accordingly, net orders, home deliveries, and average selling price ASP can be negatively affected by economic conditions, such as rising interest rates, decreases in employment and median household incomes, decreases in household formations, and increases in supply of inventories. Shortages in labor or materials can also significantly increase costs, reduce gross margins, and lower our overall profitability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we observed improved absorption rates in all markets, except California, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to successful sales promotions that have helped generate sales, partially offset by continued high mortgage interest rates and concerns about home affordability. In California, with limited exceptions, our current product offerings are at a slightly higher price point than the comparable period in the prior year and therefore a lower absorption is to be expected. Mortgage interest rates continue to be a primary concern for homebuyers and while we continue to see stabilization in most markets, homebuyers continue to be sensitive to mortgage interest rates. Our results have been impacted, and could be further impacted, by continued challenges in home affordability as a result of price appreciation, elevated mortgage interest rates, or tightening of mortgage lending standards.

Net New Home Orders, Dollar Value of Orders, and Monthly Absorption Rates 
 
 Changes in the dollar value of net new orders are impacted by changes in the number of net new orders and the ASP of those homes. Monthly Absorption Rate is calculated as total net new orders per period, divided by the average active communities during the period, divided by the number of months per period. Commentary on significant changes for each of the segments in these metrics is provided below.

 In the Arizona segment, for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced improvements across all of the metrics outlined above compared to the prior year period. We believe this was due to the continued use of sales programs throughout a challenging environment for affordability. Interest rates had a significant impact on our Arizona segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and resulted in lower net orders at that time. Although interest rates continue to be high, we have seen the market partially stabilize around those higher rates and expectations. While we continue to use targeted incentives, ASP increased and we experienced a significant amount of business during the period, resulting in a significant increase in net new orders. Even though these metrics improved during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the current interest rate environment may continue to present challenges to our business throughout all of our segments. 
 
 In the California segment, the decrease in net new orders count and dollar value for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding prior period was primarily due to community turnover along with continued challenges from the current interest rate environment. We are in the process of transitioning from some of our larger projects to new projects which are just beginning to sell. These communities have varied price points. In the months leading up to the current period, we substantially sold out three older communities which provided a significant number of orders and dollar value during the comparable period. Additionally, during the first three months of 2024, we had primarily been selling homes in communities with higher price points while two of the new communities we opened during the most recent six months ended September 30, 2024, have sales prices at a more attainable price point for the local market and we have seen additional sales coming from those communities. This change in product mix for the period contributed to the decrease in our overall ASP. Like other markets, California continues to 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 25 

see challenges from higher interest rates and there is still uncertainty about the long-term trends as consumers continue evaluating prices and overall payments in the current environment. 
 
 Our operations in our Colorado segment began in October 2023 with the acquisition of the assets of Richfield. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Colorado segment had 24 and 81 net new home orders, respectively, with ASPs of 0.5 million during both periods. 
 
 Our Florida segment has shown improvement across most net new home order metrics for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding prior period. Additional incentives continue to be key for this segment in selling homes at our desired pace. While this has kept ASPs from rising even higher, we have generally been able to drive more net new orders at a quicker pace. We continue to strive for the right balance between incentives and sales pace and are seeing the greater absorption that we have been striving for in the market. As with our other segments, buyers are still sensitive to interest rate increases which may continue to present additional challenges even as interest rates are expected to decrease over the next several quarters. 
 
 The Metro New York segment has one community, with only one residential unit and a retail space remaining to sell and deliver as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Texas segment began integrating the operations of Antares following the acquisition in April 2024. This led to an increase in net new home orders, dollar value, and absorption compared to the comparable prior periods. We expect new orders to rise throughout the year as we continue to expand our footprint in Texas and build our reputation in the areas where our communities are located. 
 
 Average Selling Communities

Home Deliveries and Home Sales Revenue 
 
 The changes in home sales revenue are the result of changes in the number of homes delivered and the ASP of those delivered homes. Commentary on significant changes for each of the segments in these metrics is provided below.

 Our Arizona segment delivered more homes at sustained price points during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior periods. The increase in home deliveries and revenue was primarily the result of increased new home orders in recent quarters as our sales incentives took hold and produced positive growth in our sales and ultimate delivery to customers. We have also seen some stabilization in incentives needed to deliver homes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior periods, however market uncertainty remains and future deliveries may require additional incentives until interest rates improve further. 
 
 Our California segment delivered more homes at higher price points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior period. The increase in home deliveries, revenue, and ASP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven primarily by communities at which we are closing homes mostly with slightly higher price points. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we delivered fewer homes as some of our communities closed out in recent periods and we are focused on driving sales at our new communities. Market uncertainty remains a key factor during the current period and future deliveries may require additional incentives until interest rates improve further. 
 
 We began operations in the Colorado segment in October 2023 following the acquisition of the assets of Richfield. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Colorado segment delivered 40 and 81 homes and generated 18.9 million and 37.9 million in home sales revenue, respectively. 
 
 Our Florida segment delivered fewer homes during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease during the periods was the result of fewer net new orders in recent periods as customers grapple with higher mortgage interest rates. Fluctuations in mortgage interest rates continue to cause uncertainty with buyers. Similar to our other segments, market uncertainty and concerns of affordability remain and could impact future results further. 
 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 27 

The Metro New York segment has one community and delivered one of its final two residential units during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The segment has only one more residential unit and a retail space remaining to deliver as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Texas segment began integrating the operations of Antares following the acquisition in April 2024. This led to an increase in home deliveries and revenue compared to the comparable prior periods. We expect deliveries to rise throughout the year as we continue to expand our footprint in Texas and build our reputation in the areas where our communities are located. 
 
 Home Sales Gross Margins 
 
 Home sales gross margin measures the price achieved on delivered homes compared to the costs incurred to build the home. In the following table, we calculate gross margins adjusting for interest in cost of sales, real estate inventories impairment, and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process inventory. We believe the below information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that indebtedness, real estate inventories impairment, and acquisitions have on the gross margins and allows for comparability to previous periods and competitors. See Note 2 Business Combination and Asset Acquisition within the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding acquired work in process inventory.

 (1) This non-GAAP financial measure should not be used as a substitute for the Company s operating results in accordance with GAAP. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure is meaningful because it provides insight into the impact that financing arrangements and acquisitions have on our homebuilding gross margin and allows for comparability of our gross margins to competitors that present similar information. 
 
 Home sales gross margin decreased by 160 basis points and 240 basis points from the corresponding periods in 2023 to 17.1 and 15.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to the need for continued sales discounts and incentives to drive sales and delivery activity in the current period coupled with higher land acquisition costs as well as higher interest costs due to the rising interest rate environment. Adjusted home sales gross margin excluding interest, real estate inventories impairment, and purchase price accounting for acquired inventory decreased 120 basis points and 200 basis points to 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 28 

22.8 and 21.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Land costs increased and discounts and incentives remained an important part of our sales strategy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. The incentives primarily related to mortgage interest rate buydowns on behalf of our home-buyers. 

Backlog 
 
 Backlog reflects the number of homes, net of cancellations, for which we have entered into a sales contract with a customer but have not yet delivered the home. 
 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Homes Dollar Value ASP Homes Dollar Value ASP Homes Dollar Value ASP (dollars in thousands) Arizona 152 70,760 466 134 58,000 433 13 22 8 California 71 59,668 840 284 253,735 893 (75) (76) (6) Colorado 14 6,857 490 N/A N/A N/A N/A Florida 373 199,546 535 342 171,004 500 9 17 7 Metro New York N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Texas (1)

 (1) Backlog acquired in Texas at the date of the Antares acquisition was 70 homes with a value of 35,118 thousand. 
 
 The decrease in the number of backlog homes and value as of September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to more of our buyers desiring quick move-in homes for certainty of delivery and certainty of payment. Therefore, we are converting our backlog at a faster rate in 2024 versus the same period in 2023. As our home deliveries have outpaced net new orders in California, our backlog has decreased. This is due in part to the transition of communities described above in that we ve recently closed out of larger communities while newer offerings are opening for sale. We also continue to see significant homebuyer demand in California for quick move-in homes which can frequently enter into a sales contract and be delivered in the same quarter. In Arizona, we have seen demand generally stabilize compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The decrease in backlog is partially offset by backlog throughout the Dallas Fort Worth metropolitan area acquired as part of our acquisition of Antares. Overall, the current market environment remains uncertain and further challenges could persist. 

Lot Sales and Other Revenue 
 
 Lot sales and other revenue and gross margin can vary significantly between reporting periods based on the number of lots under contract and the percentage of completion related to the development activities required as part of the lot sales and other contracts. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 12.9 million and 27.3 million, respectively, of lot sales and other revenue in our Arizona and Florida segments related to the sale of lots and, in certain cases, the subsequent development of lots under contract. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 19.3 million and 22.1 million, respectively, of lot sales and other revenue in our Arizona segment related to the subsequent development of lots sold in prior periods. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had contract assets of 2.6 million and 6.0 million, respectively, related to lot sales and other revenue. The contract asset balance is included in other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and represents cash to be received for work already performed on lot sale and other contracts. The amount of the transaction price for lot sales and other contracts allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 0.2 million and 1.1 million, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 the Company had no deferred revenue related to lot sales and other revenue included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 0.2 million deferred revenue related to lot sales and other revenue. We recognize these amounts as development progresses and the related performance obligations are completed.

Lots Owned or Controlled 
 
 The table below summarizes the lots owned or controlled by reportable segment as of the dates presented. Lots controlled includes lots where we have placed a deposit and have a signed purchase contract or rolling option contract.

 The total lots owned or controlled at September 30, 2024 increased 6 from September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the Antares acquisition in April 2024. While we continue to deliver on owned homes and take possession of lots previously under contract, we are monitoring the market to appropriately manage future lot contracts. Our goal remains to maintain a strong balance sheet while entering into contracts for new lots when we are satisfied that the timing and metrics support our actions. 

Results of Operations by Segment 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Pretax income (loss) (dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands) Arizona 7,792 5,253 12,625 4,826 California 9,580 9,795 28,788 17,184 Colorado 167 (1,913) Florida 2,026 4,378 7,850 23,993 Metro New York (636) (917) (2,885) (1,818) Texas (1,142) (1,383) (5,880) (4,144) Corporate (2,898) (4,577) (18,387) (14,246) Total 14,889 12,549 20,198 25,795 
 
 Our Arizona segment recorded pretax income of 7.8 million and 12.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pretax income of 5.3 million and 4.8 million in the comparable periods in 2023. The increase in pretax income during the current periods was primarily due to an increase in deliveries and home sales revenue despite the incentives required to continue to close homes at our desired pace as well as slightly lower sales, marketing, and general and administrative SG A expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue during the current periods. 
 
 Our California segment recorded pretax income of 9.6 million and 28.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pretax income of 9.8 million and 17.2 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase in pretax income during the nine-month period was primarily due to a comparative increase in deliveries and home sales revenue as well as lower SG A expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. This was partially offset by increased costs of home sales resulting in lower gross margins. 
 
 Colorado operations began in October 2023 with the acquisition of the assets of Richfield. Our Colorado segment recorded pretax income of 0.2 million and pretax loss of 1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Our Florida segment recorded pretax income of 2.0 million and 7.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pretax income of 4.4 million and 24.0 million in the comparable period in 2023. As noted above, slower net new orders during much of 2023 driven primarily by rising mortgage interest rates resulted in lower deliveries in the nine months 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 30 

ended September 30, 2024. Lower gross margins driven primarily by the need for incentives as well as higher SG A expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year have suppressed the segment s net income. Increased incentives and marketing efforts have been effective in increasing net new orders and we expect to see those deliveries and increased revenue reflected in upcoming quarters. Higher inflation and mortgage interest rates may still present challenges in the near future. 
 
 The Metro New York segment recorded a pretax loss of 0.6 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pretax loss of 0.9 million and 1.8 million in the comparable period in 2023. We continue to wind down the sales and deliveries activities in this segment. 
 
 Our Texas segment recorded pretax loss of 1.1 million and 5.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to pretax loss of 1.4 million and 4.1 million in the comparable period in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Texas segment began integrating the operations of Antares following the acquisition in April 2024, which led to incremental costs from Antares operations. Additionally, gross margins at Texas are subject to the effects of purchase price accounting adjustments which increased the book value of our real estate inventories at the time of acquisition and will continue to result in lower gross margins for a period of time until the acquired inventories are delivered. 
 
 We have also identified our Corporate operations as a non-operating segment, as it serves to support the business s operations through functional departments such as executive, finance, treasury, human resources, accounting, and legal. The majority of the Corporate personnel and resources are dedicated to activities relating to the business s operations and are allocated accordingly. The Corporate non-operating segment generated a larger pretax loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to transaction costs resulting from the Antares acquisition and the secondary offering in the first half of the year. Debt costs related to the issuance of senior notes and the modification of our revolving credit facility including the write-off of previous deferred financing costs, as well as one-time severance costs also contributed to the corporate operations costs. 

Sales, Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, As a Percentage of Home Sales 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing expenses 23,445 16,930 7.2 6.6 General and administrative expenses 21,932 25,463 6.7 9.9 Total sales, marketing, and G A expenses 45,377 42,393 13.9 16.5

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to the increasing volume of sales and deliveries and thus related commission costs as well as higher marketing and advertising costs in the current period. General and administrative G A costs also increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to transaction costs associated with the Antares acquisition and one-time severance costs. Continuing compensation and other administrative costs grew as we brought on the additional employees related to the Antares acquisition. G A costs decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior period due to lower compensation, including the effects of the recent reduction-in-force, partially offset by additional costs from the Antares acquisition. 
 
 The SG A expense rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.9 and 13.9 , a decrease of 2.6 and 2.0 from the prior year periods, respectively. The SG A expense rate decreased primarily due to higher deliveries and home sales revenue in the current periods compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 31 

more than offset the increases in SG A expenses discussed above. We expect to continue to be able to further leverage our G A base, including wages, and reduce the percentage of SG A compared to home sales revenue in future periods. 

Other income (expense), net 
 
 Other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of income from our Landsea Elements activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the results were offset by a million write-off of previously deferred financing costs associated with the amendment of the revolving credit facility in April 2024. 

Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.5 million and 4.8 million, respectively. Income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.1 million and 6.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.5 and 24.0 compared to 24.4 and 24.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefits and estimated deduction limitations for executive compensation under Section 162(m), partially offset by tax credits for energy-efficient homes. The difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefits and estimated deduction limitations for executive compensation under Section 162(m), partially offset by tax credits for energy-efficient homes. 
 
 The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements might be impacted if we used different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 36.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and cash held in escrow, a 132.4 million decrease from December 31, 2023. The change was primarily due to the acquisition of Antares, net paydowns of our revolving credit facility, and ordinary business activities as cash from home deliveries was primarily reinvested to acquire and construct additional real estate inventories. This was partially offset by cash receipts from the issuance of 300 million of senior notes. See below for additional information on the senior notes. Cash held in escrow represents closings happening immediately before quarter-end in which we received the funds from the title company subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 Our principal sources of capital are cash generated from home and land sales activities, borrowings under our credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of senior notes. Principal uses of capital are land purchases, land development, home construction, repayments on the credit facility, the acquisition of other homebuilders, and the payment of routine liabilities. 
 Cash flows for each community depend on the community s stage in the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, entitlements and other approvals, and construction of model homes, roads, utilities, general landscaping, and other amenities. Given that these costs are a component of inventory and not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognizing earnings. In the later stages of community development, cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes, as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred. From a liquidity standpoint, we are actively acquiring and developing lots in our markets to maintain and grow our supply of lots and active selling communities. 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 32 

We expect to generate cash from the sale of inventory including homes under construction. We generally intend to re-deploy the cash generated from the sale of inventory to acquire and develop strategic, well-positioned lots that represent opportunities to generate future income and cash flows by allocating capital to best position us for long-term success. When it meets our strategic goals, we may continue to purchase companies that strengthen our position in markets in a way that would not be possible with organic growth. As we continue to expand our business, we expect that our cash outlays for land purchases and development may, at times, exceed our cash generated by operations. 
 We intend to utilize debt as part of our ongoing financial strategy, coupled with redeployment of cash flows from operations to finance our business. We believe the continued strength of our balance sheet and operating platform position us well to continue to execute our growth strategy and are focused on reducing our leverage ratios over time, with approximate targets for our debt to capital and net debt to total capital ratios in the mid-40s and mid-30s, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 757.4 million in aggregate principal, excluding discount and deferred loan costs, and had 226.7 million in additional borrowing capacity under our credit facility. We will consider several factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our business as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. In addition, our Amended Credit Agreement and the agreements governing our Senior Notes (both as defined below) contain certain financial covenants, among other things, which limit the amount of leverage we can maintain, as well as minimum tangible net worth and liquidity requirements. 
 We believe that we will be able to fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs with our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and cash expected to be available from our credit facility or through accessing debt or equity capital as needed. 

Line of Credit Facility 
 In October 2021, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement which was amended in April 2024 (the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured borrowing of up to 455.0 million of which there was 207.4 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024. As part of the amendment, the Company wrote off 5.2 million of previously deferred financing costs associated with the line of credit facility prior to the amendment. This write-off is included in other (expense) income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company may increase the borrowing capacity up to 850.0 million, under certain conditions. Funds available under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to a borrowing base requirement which is calculated on specified percentages of our real estate inventories. The Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a daily simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate, a term SOFR rate, or a base rate (in each case calculated in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is adjusted by reference to a grid based on a leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margin was 3.40 . The Amended Credit Agreement matures in April 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement matures in April 2027. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the loan was 8.23 .

 In July 2023, the Company entered into a senior unsecured note (the Note Purchase Agreement ). The Note Purchase Agreement provided for the private placement of 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 11.0 senior notes (the 11.0 Senior Notes ). The Company received the proceeds, net of discount and fees, in July 2023. The 11.0 Senior Notes mature in July 2028. 
 In April 2024, the Company completed the sale to certain purchasers of 300.0 million of 8.875 senior notes (the 8.875 Senior Notes , together with the 11.0 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes ).The Company received the proceeds, net of fees, in April 2024. The 8.875 Senior Notes mature in April 2029. 
 Our Senior Notes are not secured, however, the agreements governing the Senior Notes contain some restrictions on secured debt and other transactions. Our Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by most of our homebuilding segment subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at our option, with a standard make whole provision until July 17, 2025 then at premiums that vary based upon the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed.

Financial Covenants 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement have certain financial covenants, including requirements for us to maintain a minimum liquidity balance, minimum tangible net worth as well as maximum leverage and interest coverage ratios. See the table below for the covenant calculations.

 58.0 
 The Amended Credit Agreement and agreements governing the Senior Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants, including limitations on incurrence of other indebtedness, liens, dividends and other distributions, asset dispositions, restricted payments, investments, and limitations on fundamental changes. They contain customary events of default for such facilities, subject to cure periods in certain circumstances, which would result in the termination of the commitments in the case of the Amended Credit Agreement and permit the lenders or holders, as applicable, to accelerate payment on outstanding amounts. These events of default include nonpayment of principal, interest, and fees or other amounts; breach of covenants, including those described above; inaccuracy of representations and warranties; cross default to certain other indebtedness; unpaid judgments; and certain bankruptcy and other insolvency events. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under each of our Amended Credit Agreement and the agreements governing the Senior Notes. 

Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, and as part of the entitlement and development process, the Company s subsidiaries are required to provide performance bonds to assure completion of certain public facilities. The Company had 115.8 million and 109.3 million of performance bonds outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Cash Flows Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the comparison of cash flows is as follows: 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 18.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 2.1 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to a 43.6 million increase in cash spent on real estate inventories and a 25.0 million increase in cash spent on other assets compared to the prior period. These cash movements were partially offset by an increase of 38.9 million compared to the prior period in collections of cash held in escrow, as well as fewer payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses in the normal course of business resulting in an increase of 10.1 million in cash from operating activities. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 240.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.5 million during the same period in 2023. This difference was related to payments of 235.0 million, net of cash received, which we made in connection with our acquisition of Antares in April 2024, while we did not acquire any businesses in the prior period. 
 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 34 

Net cash provided by financing activities was 171.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.3 million during the same period in 2023. The increase in cash received was primarily due to the issuance of 300.0 million worth of senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 242.5 million, net of discount, in the prior period. We also had net proceeds of 14.9 million from other financing transactions, less net repayments on the revolving credit facility of 81.7 million, and 14.7 million less spent on repurchases of our common stock compared to the prior period. This was partially offset by a 9.9 million increase in cash distributions to a partner which holds a noncontrolling interest in one of our consolidated joint ventures. 
 
 Option Contracts 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land purchase contracts in order to procure lots for the construction of homes. We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved lots. These purchase contracts typically require a cash deposit, and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements, including obtaining applicable property and development entitlements. We also utilize option contracts with land sellers and others as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns, to help manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings, and to reduce the use of funds from financing sources. Option contracts generally require payment of a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices. Our obligations with respect to purchase contracts and option contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related non-refundable cash deposits. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding purchase and option contracts totaling 713.3 million, net of 105.3 million related cash deposits (of which 1.7 million was refundable) pertaining to these contracts. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding purchase and option contracts totaling 663.1 million, net of 96.2 million related cash deposits (of which 1.0 million was refundable) pertaining to these contracts. 
 
 The utilization of land option contracts is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers willing to enter into option takedown arrangements, the availability of capital to financial intermediaries to finance the development of optioned lots, general housing market conditions, and local market dynamics. Options may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain geographic regions. 

Material Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there had been no material changes to our known contractual and other obligations appearing in the Material Cash Requirements section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 
 Stock Repurchases 
 In March 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing for the repurchase of up to 10.0 million worth of common stock, with an expiration of December 31, 2023. In July 2023, the Board of Directors authorized additional capacity of approximately 3.3 million, with an expiration date of December 31, 2023, and an additional 10.0 million with no stated expiration date. In October 2023, the Board of Directors authorized additional capacity of 20.0 million with no stated expiration date. No additional stock repurchase authorizations occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 534,436 shares of common stock for a total of 6.4 million, excluding commissions, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 2.5 million in remaining capacity from previous authorizations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1,391,867 and 2,360,736 shares of common stock for a total of 13.7 million and 21.2 million, respectively, excluding commissions, which was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. A portion of these shares were repurchased directly from the Company s majority shareholder at the time. Refer to Note 9 Related Party Transactions for additional information. 
 The timing and amount of repurchases are based on a variety of factors such as the market price of the Company's common stock, corporate and contractual requirements, market and economic conditions, and legal requirements. 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 35 

Seasonality 
 
 Historically, the homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity during the spring, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes four to eight months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs, and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We include non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted home sales gross margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net debt to total capital, and adjusted net income. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors additional insights to facilitate the analysis of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies may use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP financial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented. 

Net Debt to Total Capital 
 
 The following table presents the ratio of debt to capital as well as the ratio of net debt to total capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ratio of debt to capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing total debt, net of issuance costs, by total capital (sum of total debt, net of issuance costs, plus total equity). 
 
 The non-GAAP ratio of net debt to total capital is computed as the quotient obtained by dividing net debt (which is total debt, net of issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents as well as cash held in escrow to the extent necessary to reduce the debt balance to zero) by total capital. The most comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of debt to capital. We believe the ratio of net debt to total capital is a relevant financial measure for investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of our ability to obtain financing. We believe that by deducting our cash from our debt, we provide a measure of our indebtedness that takes into account our cash liquidity. We believe this provides useful information as the ratio of debt to capital does not take into account our liquidity and we believe that the ratio of net debt to total capital provides supplemental information by which our financial position may be considered. 
 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 36 

See table below reconciling this non-GAAP measure to the ratio of debt to capital.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 The following table presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in evaluating operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) income tax (benefit) expense, (ii) interest expenses, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) real estate inventories impairment, (v) purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, (vi) loss on debt modification, (vii) transaction costs related to business combinations, (viii) write-off of deferred offering costs, and (ix) abandoned projects costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest, effective tax rates, levels of depreciation and amortization, and items considered to be non-recurring. Accordingly, we believe this measure is useful for comparing our core operating performance from period to period. 
 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 37 

Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Adjusted Net Income 
 
 Adjusted Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating and understanding our operating results without the effect of certain expenses that were historically pushed down by our parent company and other non-recurring items. We believe excluding these items provides a more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted Net Income attributable to Landsea Homes is calculated by excluding the effects of related party interest that was pushed down by our parent company, purchase accounting adjustments for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations, loss on debt 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 38 

modification, and real estate inventories impairment, and tax-effected using a blended statutory tax rate. We adjust for the expense of related party interest pushed down from our parent company as we have no obligation to repay the debt and related interest.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Due to the nature of homebuilding and our business we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and inflation as described below. We are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in our stock prices and related characteristics. 
 
 Interest Rates 
 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with (i) variable rate debt such as our revolving credit facility and (ii) demand and pricing pressure with respect to home sales. Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on a daily simple SOFR rate, a term SOFR rate, or a base rate (in each case calculated in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement). The Senior Notes bear interest on the outstanding amount at fixed rates of 11.0 and 8.875 per annum, and therefore are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Higher interest rates are associated with downward demand and pricing pressure with respect to home sales and we may need to provide mortgage interest-related incentives to consumers to remain competitive in certain markets. For a more complete discussion of the impact of interest rates on our results of operations, see Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Operations can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material, and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to customers through increased prices, when weak housing market conditions exist, we are often unable to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, under the supervision of our Company s Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures: (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (b) include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to Company s management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 See Part 1, Item1, Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies - Legal . 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Other than the below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 
 Because Landsea Green holds a significant percentage of our common stock, it may influence the outcome of major corporate decisions, and the interests of Landsea Green and its affiliates, including certain of our directors, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. 
 
 Landsea Green Management Limited Landsea Green currently holds, indirectly, approximately 24.9 of our common stock, and we are party to an amended and restated stockholder s agreement with Landsea Holdings Corporation, a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Landsea Green. As a result, Landsea Green is able to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders or our board of directors, including the election of directors, the selection of senior management, disposals of assets or business, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the size and timing of annual budgets, increases or decreases in stock capital and issuances of new securities. 
 
 Landsea Green may have interests that are different from, and potentially adverse to, our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree. In addition, certain of our directors are currently affiliated with Landsea Green, and, as a result, may have real or apparent conflicts of interest on matters affecting both us and Landsea Green, which in some cases may have interests adverse to ours. Landsea Green s concentration of ownership could also negatively affect our ability to obtain financing required for opportunistic investments or to offset periods of net losses or financial distress, or have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities, decrease our ability to avoid defaults under our obligations or cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
 
 While we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of Nasdaq rules, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements during a one-year transition period. 
 
 Until March 8, 2024, Landsea Green beneficially owned a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock, making us a controlled company. Pursuant to Nasdaq listing standards, a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq listing standards that would otherwise require it to have a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors, a compensation committee that has a formal written charter and is comprised solely of independent directors and independent director oversight of director nominations. Our Board of directors is currently composed of a majority of independent directors. Our compensation committee and our nominating and corporate governance committee are also composed of a majority of independent directors, but are not required to consist entirely of independent directors until the end of the one-year transition period. Accordingly, until the end of the transition period, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. 
 
 The Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS may modify, delay or prevent our future acquisition or investment activities, and U.S. state or federal laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate in the United States. 
 
 For so long as Landsea Green retains a material ownership interest in us, we will be deemed a foreign person under the regulations relating to CFIUS. As such, acquisitions of or investments in U.S. businesses, including foreign businesses with U.S. subsidiaries, may be subject to CFIUS review, the scope of which includes, among other things, certain non-passive, non-controlling investments (including certain investments in entities that hold or process personal information about U.S. nationals), certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business, transactions the structure of which is designed or intended to evade or circumvent CFIUS jurisdiction, and any transaction resulting in a change in the rights of a foreign person in a U.S. business if that change could result in either control of the business or a covered non-controlling investment. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization 
 Landsea Homes Corp. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 41 

Act of 2018 FIRRMA also subjects certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. If a particular proposed acquisition or investment in a U.S. business falls within CFIUS s jurisdiction, we may determine that we are required to make a mandatory filing or that we will submit to CFIUS review on a voluntary basis, or to proceed with the transaction without submitting to CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the transaction. CFIUS may decide to block or delay an acquisition or investment by us, impose conditions with respect to such acquisition or investment or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business that we acquired without first obtaining CFIUS approval, which may limit the attractiveness of or prevent us from pursuing certain acquisitions or investments that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. In addition, among other things, FIRRMA authorizes CFIUS to prescribe regulations defining foreign person differently in different contexts, which could result in less favorable treatment for investments and acquisitions by companies from countries of special concern. If such future regulations impose additional burdens on acquisition and investment activities involving PRC and PRC-controlled entities, our ability to consummate transactions falling within CFIUS s jurisdiction that might otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders may be hindered. In addition, U.S. state or federal laws or regulations may restrict our normal business operations in the United States for so long as any China-domiciled individual or entities with their principal places of business in China (including Landsea Green), own a significant percentage of our outstanding shares of common stock, which could limit future growth in such jurisdictions. For example, a law that recently became effective in Florida prohibits, with limited exemptions, certain China-related persons and entities from, directly or indirectly, owning, having a controlling interest in, or acquiring certain real estate in Florida, including agricultural land or property located in proximity to military installations or critical infrastructure facilities. While we believe that the reduction of Landsea Green s ownership to below 25 of our common stock and other steps taken to insulate decisions with respect to Florida real property from Landsea Green s influence will be sufficient to prevent us from being subject to restrictions under this law, which is also subject to ongoing administrative interpretation and court challenges, these steps may be determined not to be sufficient, and our operations and future growth in Florida, or in any other jurisdiction which enacts a similar law, could be curtailed. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 The following table sets forth information concerning the Company s repurchases of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
