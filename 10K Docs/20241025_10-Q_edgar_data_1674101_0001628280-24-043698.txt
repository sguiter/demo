 , , and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily influenced by the negative impacts of non-deductible changes in the fair value of the warrant liabilities and discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation activity in the respective periods. The effective rate for the comparative three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily influenced by the mix of income between the Company s U.S. and non-U.S. operations, net of changes in valuation allowances reflect the negative impacts of non-deductible changes in the fair value of the warrant liabilities and the impact of changes in our indefinite reinvestment liability. 
 The Company provided U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on all temporary differences attributed to basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has certain earnings of certain foreign affiliates that continue to be indefinitely reinvested, but it was not practicable to estimate the associated deferred tax liability, due to interaction with other tax laws and regulations in the year of inclusion.

 Interest rate swaps From time to time the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments designed to hedge the variability in interest expense on floating rate debt. Derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. When the derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value are deferred through other comprehensive income depending on the effectiveness of the instrument. 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk of the Company s total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges effectively swapped a notional amount of of SOFR-based floating rate debt for fixed rate debt. The Company s interest rate swaps mature in March 2027. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized , , and , respectively, within Interest expense, net on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss). At September 30, 2024, the Company expects that approximately of pre-tax net gains on cash flow hedges will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the next twelve months. 
 The interest rate swaps are valued using the SOFR yield curves at the reporting date. Counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. The fair values of the Company s interest rate swaps are adjusted for nonperformance risk and creditworthiness of the counterparty through the Company s credit valuation adjustment CVA ). The CVA is calculated at the counterparty level utilizing the fair value exposure at each payment date and applying a weighted probability of the appropriate survival and marginal default percentages.

 Vertiv shareholders, Matthew Sullivan and Jose Karlo Ocampo Avenido, brought a derivative lawsuit, Sullivan v. Johnson, et al., C.A. No. 2023-0608, against Vertiv (as nominal defendant only) and certain of the Company s directors and officers in Delaware Court of Chancery for breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint alleges that certain of the named directors and officers caused the Company to issue materially false and/or misleading public statements with respect to inflationary and supply chain pressures and pricing issues, and that the Company suffered damages as a result. This action has been stayed since August 10, 2023, pending the securities class action. 
 We believe we have meritorious defenses against the allegations made in the aforementioned lawsuits, which are at the preliminary stages. However, we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of these matters or the amount of any cost associated with their resolution. 
 In November 2023, following the filing of the actions described above, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and a parallel request for documents from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York, which relate to the allegations made in the class action complaint and derivative action. The Company is actively responding to these matters. 
 In January 2024, the Mexican tax administration service, the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (the "SAT"), initiated a process to suspend the importer registration of one of the Company's wholly owned Mexico subsidiaries, Tecnolog a del Pac fico S.A. de C.V. TDP ), in connection with a contested customs tax audit for the period April 2016 to February 2018. SAT claimed its basis for the suspension was a failure by TDP to provide sufficient e vidence of the export of goods temporarily imported at required levels under Mexico's Manufacturing, Maquila and Export Services Industries Program ("IMMEX Program"). The Company and TDP has disputed SAT s position throughout the customs tax audit, through the filing of various petitions and appeals with appropriate documentation evidencing the complete and timely export of the goods temporarily imported during the audit period. TDP accepted a proposal from SAT to close the audit by making payments and fees totaling approximately which was recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2024. The Company intends to seek reimbursement of this amount as an undue payment in the near future from SAT, for which the outcome is currently unknown and no receivable has been established. 
 We are unable at this time to predict the outcome of these matters, including whether any proceedings may be instituted in connection with the government inquiries, or the amount of any cost associated with their resolution, except as noted above. 
 At September 30, 2024, other than as described above, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, taxes and other claims) that management believes were or will be material in relation to the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.

 Overview 
 We are a global leader in the design, manufacturing and servicing of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. We provide this technology to data centers, communication networks and commercial and industrial environments worldwide. We aim to help create a world where critical technologies always work, and where we empower the vital applications of the digital world. 
 Outlook and Trends 
 Below is a summary of trends and events that are currently affecting, or may in the future affect, our business, operations and short-term outlook: 
 Capacity Expansion: We have invested in capacity expansion to meet current and anticipated additional customer demand. For example, since acquiring E I in late 2021, we have approximately doubled our manufacturing capacity for switchgear, busbar and integrated solutions by opening new facilities and adding production to existing facilities. Additionally, in order to support our thermal management activity, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Pune, India in 2024 to further support our manufacturing capacity. We also recently opened a new facility in Pelzer, South Carolina to support the production of modular solutions, modular power systems and other infrastructure systems. We anticipate continuing to invest in capacity globally to provide the geographic presence that our customers need, and the ability to rapidly scale and to ensure resiliency. 
 Artificial Intelligence ("AI"): Increased maturity and adoption of AI and high-performance compute is currently impacting the data center industry, driving technology innovation which has led to increased demand. The Company has invested in developing new product, services, and solutions to serve this industry trend, is increasing capacity to support additional demand for AI infrastructure as necessary and we will continue to invest to support additional growth driven by AI. 
 Thermal Management Portfolio Expansion: We continue to invest in expansion of our thermal management portfolio and product capabilities to meet customer demands. The complexity of hybrid air and liquid cooling created by AI workloads presents significant opportunities for innovation within, and expansion of, the entire thermal chain to better optimize performance, power utilization, control, and heat re-use. Our investment and expansion efforts are directed at capturing new technologies across the entire thermal chain from chip to heat rejection and re-use and more to meet growing demands. Further, we are focused on the continued growth and expansion of our portfolio geographically, as we leverage our best-in-class regional products and expand such offerings into other regions and globally.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales were 2,073.5 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 330.9, or 19.0 , compared with 1,742.6 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in sales was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, partially offset by the negative impacts from foreign currency of 4.2. Product sales increased 266.3, which included the negative impacts from foreign currency of 2.5. Services spares sales increased 64.6, which included the negative impacts from foreign currency of 1.7. 
 Excluding intercompany sales, net sales were 1,198.6 in the Americas, 432.4 in Asia Pacific and 442.5 in Europe, Middle East Africa. Movements in net sales by segment and offering are each detailed in the Business Segments section below. 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales were 1,317.1 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 202.1, or 18.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by the impact of higher volumes. Gross profit was 756.4 in the third quarter of 2024, or 36.5 of sales, compared to 627.6, or 36.0 of sales in the third quarter of 2023. The margin expansion in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, pricing actions exceeding inflationary costs and manufacturing and procurement productivity. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A were 334.6 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 7.4, or 2.3 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in SG A was primarily driven by increased compensation costs and increased research and development costs. SG A as a percentage of sales were 16.1 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 18.8 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Other Operating Expense 
 The remaining other operating expenses includes amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, foreign currency (gain) loss, and other operating expense (income). These remaining operating expenses were 50.2 for the third quarter of 2024, which was a 0.7 increase from the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 5.0 increase in restructuring costs and a 2.6 increase in foreign currency loss offset by 3.3 of income related to mark-to-market gains on our economic hedges.

 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities represents the mark-to-market fair value adjustments to the outstanding warrants ("Private Placement Warrants") issued in connection with the initial public offering of our predecessor GS Acquisition Holdings Corp. The change in fair value of the outstanding Private Placement Warrants during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 resulted in a loss of 67.2 and 61.6, respectively. The change in fair value of these warrants is the result of changes in market prices of our common stock and other observable inputs deriving the value of the financial instruments. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 5,266,667 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net, was 35.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 43.5 in the third quarter of 2023. The 7.6 decrease is primarily driven by 4.9 of reduced interest expense as a result of our Term Loan amendments which resulted in a reduction to our interest rate margin and a 2.6 increase in interest income. To the extent interest rates continue to fluctuate our interest expense will change, although we expect these changes to be mitigated by our interest rate swaps and interest income. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 91.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 51.7 in the third quarter of 2023. The 40.2 increase is primarily due to increased business performance and the change in the discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation. The effective rate in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily influenced by the negative impact of non-deductible changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities and discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation. For the third quarter of 2023, income tax expense was primarily influenced by the mix of income between our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, net of valuation allowances, and reflects the negative impact of non-deductible changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities. 
 Business Segments 
 The following is detail of business segment results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment profitability is defined as operating profit (loss). Segment margin represents segment operating profit (loss) expressed as a percentage of segment net sales. For reconciliations of segment net sales and earnings to our consolidated results, see Note 11 Segment Information, of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment net sales are presented excluding intercompany sales.

 Americas net sales were 1,198.6 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 195.4, or 19.5 , from the third quarter of 2023. The increase in sales was primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to products increasing by 160.0 and service spares increasing by 35.4.

 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities represents the mark-to-market fair value adjustments to the outstanding Private Placement Warrants. The change in fair value of the outstanding warrant liability during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 resulted in a loss of 269.2 and a loss of 103.4, respectively. The change in fair value of these Private Placement Warrants was the result of changes in market prices of our common stock and other observable inputs deriving the value of the financial instruments and the exercise of 5,266,666 of the private placement warrants in February 2023 by GS Sponsor LLC. As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 5,266,667 private placement warrants that remained outstanding. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net, was 119.7 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 137.2 in the first nine months of 2023. The 17.5 decrease is primarily driven by a 13.6 increase in interest income and a 7.7 decrease in interest due to lower ABL Revolving Credit Facility borrowings during the period. To the extent interest rates continue to fluctuate our interest expense will change, although we expect these changes to be mitigated by our interest rate swaps. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense (benefit) was 171.4 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 118.8 in the first nine months of 2023. The 52.6 increase is primarily due to increased business results between the periods as well as the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities between the periods net of increased tax benefits due to stock compensation activity. The effective rate in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily influenced by the negative impacts of non-deductible changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities and discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation. In the first nine months of 2023, income tax expense was primarily influenced by the mix of income between our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, net of changes in valuation allowances and the negative impacts of non-deductible changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities and changes to our indefinite reinvestment liability.

 Capital Expenditures: Our capital expenditures are primarily related to the maintenance of our long-term assets, as well as the investment in projects, such as capacity and facility expansion, that support growth and innovation to further our enterprise strategy. Our capital expenditures (including capitalized software) were approximately 120.7 during the first nine months of 2024. We expect to have capital expenditures (including capitalized software) of 175 to 200 for the full year 2024. 
 We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations and other financial instruments. Refer below, as well as to Note 5 Debt and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In addition, we have uncertain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 6 Income Taxes of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We anticipate payments for lease obligations of approximately 60 for the full year 2024. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which could materially impact our financial condition or liquidity. 
 We, through our subsidiaries, are party to certain indebtedness arrangements, including the Senior Secured Notes due 2028, with an outstanding principal amount of 850.0 as of September 30, 2024 (the Notes ), the Term Loan due 2027, with an outstanding principal amount of 2,102.2, as of September 30, 2024 (the Term Loan ), and the ABL Revolving Credit Facility due 2029, which was extended earlier in 2024, providing up to 600.0 of revolving borrowings, for which we had no amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and collectively with the Term Loan, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities ). See Note 5 Debt of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed discussion of the material terms of the Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 908.7 in cash and cash equivalents, which includes amounts held outside of the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia. Non-U.S. cash is generally available for repatriation without legal restrictions, subject to certain taxes, mainly withholding taxes. We are not asserting indefinite reinvestment of cash or outside basis for our non-U.S. subsidiaries due to the outstanding debt obligations in instances where alternative repatriation options, other than dividends, are not available. At September 30, 2024, Vertiv had 584.2 of availability (subject to customary borrowing base and other conditions) under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, net of letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of 15.8, and taking into account the borrowing base limitations set forth in the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. 
 We believe our current cash and cash equivalent levels, augmented by availability under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, will provide adequate near-term liquidity for the next 12 months of independent operations, as well as the resources necessary to invest for growth in existing businesses and manage our capital structure on a short- and long-term basis. We expect to continue to opportunistically access the capital and financing markets from time to time. Access to capital and the availability of financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including our credit rating, economic conditions, and the overall liquidity of capital markets. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital and financing markets on acceptable terms.

 Net Cash provided by (used for) Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 894.1 in the first nine months of 2024, a 349.8 increase in cash generation compared to the first nine months of 2023. Net income from operations of 348.8 included 453.4 of net non-cash expense items, consisting of depreciation and amortization of 206.0, a loss on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 269.2, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of 25.8, and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of 5.5, offset by deferred taxes of 53.1. Trade working capital provided 69.2 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 17.8 utilized in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net Cash used for Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 120.7 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net cash used for investing activities of 71.1 in the first nine months of 2023. The increased use of cash over the comparable period was primarily driven by decreased proceeds from the disposition of property, plant and equipment of 12.4, increased capital expenditures of 26.2, and an increase in investments of capitalized software of 11.0. 
 Net Cash provided by (used for) Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 640.4 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 236.7 provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in cash used in 2024 was primarily the result of 599.9 of share repurchases related to common stock, 28.1 in dividend payments, offset by a decrease in year-over-year net repayments of 235.0 on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility in the first nine months of 2023, 16.6 decrease in net cash received associated with equity-based compensation activity, and 5.9 decrease of repayments on the Term Loan in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. The preceding discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The 2023 financial statements, as part of the 2023 Form 10-K, includes additional information about us, our operations, our financial condition, our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There has been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures from those described in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains (a) disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), and (b) internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information for the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 With the exception of the below, the Company is not a party to any material, pending legal proceedings or claims at September 30, 2024. From time-to-time, the Company may be a party to, or otherwise involved in, legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The nature of the Company s business ordinarily results in a certain amount of pending as well as threatened claims, litigation, investigations, regulatory and legal and administrative cases, matters and proceedings, all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. When the Company determines that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted, the Company vigorously defends itself. The Company considers settlement of cases when, in management s judgment, it is in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders to do so. 
 On May 3, 2022, a putative securities class action, In re Vertiv Holdings Co Securities Litigation , 22-cv-3572, was filed against Vertiv, certain of the Company s officers and directors, and other defendants in the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 16, 2022. The amended complaint alleges that certain of the Company s public statements were materially false and/or misleading with respect to inflationary and supply chain pressures and pricing issues, and asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These claims are asserted on behalf of a putative class of all persons and entities that (i) purchased Vertiv securities between February 24, 2021 and February 22, 2022; and/or (ii) purchased Vertiv securities in or traceable to the November 4, 2021 secondary public offering by a selling stockholder pursuant to a resale registration statement. On January 31, 2024, the Court issued an order dismissing the claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act. The motion to dismiss the claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act remains pending. 
 On June 9, 2023, two Vertiv shareholders, Matthew Sullivan and Jose Karlo Ocampo Avenido, brought a derivative lawsuit, Sullivan v. Johnson, et al., C.A. No. 2023-0608, against Vertiv (as nominal defendant only) and certain of the Company s directors and officers in Delaware Court of Chancery for breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint alleges that certain of the named directors and officers caused the Company to issue materially false and/or misleading public statements with respect to inflationary and supply chain pressures and pricing issues, and that the Company suffered damages as a result. This action has been stayed since August 10, 2023, pending the securities class action. 
 We believe we have meritorious defenses against the allegations made in the aforementioned lawsuits, which are at the preliminary stages. However, we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of these matters or the amount of any cost associated with their resolution. 
 In November 2023, following the filing of the actions described above, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and a parallel request for documents from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York, which relate to the allegations made in the class action complaint and derivative action. The Company is actively responding to these matters. 
 In January 2024, the Mexican tax administration service, the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (the "SAT"), initiated a process to suspend the importer registration of one of the Company's wholly owned Mexico subsidiaries, Tecnolog a del Pac fico S.A. de C.V. TDP ), in connection with a contested customs tax audit for the period April 2016 to February 2018. SAT claimed its basis for the suspension was a failure by TDP to provide sufficient e vidence of the export of goods temporarily imported at required levels under Mexico's Manufacturing, Maquila and Export Services Industries Program ("IMMEX Program"). The Company and TDP has disputed SAT s position throughout the customs tax audit, through the filing of various petitions and appeals with appropriate documentation evidencing the complete and timely export of the goods temporarily imported during the audit period. TDP accepted a proposal from SAT to close the audit by making payments and fees totaling approximately 10.1 which was recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2024. The Company intends to seek reimbursement of this amount as an undue payment in the near future from SAT, for which the outcome is currently unknown and no receivable has been established. 
 We are unable at this time to predict the outcome of these matters, including whether any proceedings may be instituted in connection with the government inquiries, or the amount of any cost associated with their resolution. 
 At September 30, 2024, other than as described above, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, taxes and other claims) that management believes were or will be material in relation to the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.

The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares of Class A common stock and the Board's authorization of the program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, Vertiv purchased 9,076,444 shares of its common stock, par value 0.0001 per share. During the second quarter of 2024, all shares repurchased were retired. As of September 30, 2024, 2.4 billion remain for additional share repurchases.
