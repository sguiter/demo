NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Overview Hawkeye Systems, Inc. (the Company ), is a Nevada corporation incorporated on May 15, 2018. Our previous focus was on pandemic management products and services. From inception until July of 2021, we focused on selling personal protective equipment PPE ). In July 2021, our management determined to cease the Company s operations as a seller of PPE, deeming that continuing operations in that sector was not a productive use of our resources. We are currently looking for investment opportunities in diversified industries, such as affordable housing development, and technology applications to mitigate the effects of climate change. From inception until the date of this filing our activities have primarily consisted of (i) liquidating our stock of personal protective equipment PPE products, (ii) the development of our business plan and the evaluation of strategic investment and business development strategies, including the execution of letters of intent and the provision of funding to a few selected target companies. Basis of presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on September 30, 2024. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions used for stock-based compensation, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 7 Table of Contents Fair value measurements When required to measure assets or liabilities at fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used. The Company determines the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. The categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 uses significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. The amount of the total gains or losses for the period are included in earnings that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date. The Company has no assets or liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis. Revenue recognition As of September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had no revenue. Cost of sales As of September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had no cost of sales. Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, including stock options, warrants to purchase the Company s common stock, and convertible note payable with accrued interest. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive were as follows: September 30 , September 30 , 2024 2023 Warrants - 239,401 Options 332,600 425,600 Convertible notes - 672,798 Total possible dilutive shares 332,600 1,337,799 Recent accounting pronouncements Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and their potential effect on our financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC subtopic 815-40 Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity . The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has early adopted this standard effective July 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective approach transition method. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For receivables, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. In addition, an entity will have to disclose significantly more information about allowances and credit quality indicators. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted the standard beginning in fiscal year 2023. Because the standard is still in the early stages of adoption, the Company assesses that the current adoption of the standard has not had a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and will continue to monitor it as it progresses through year-end close. 8 Table of Contents Note 2 - Going Concern The Company s financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP, applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using GAAP, applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 156,720, and an accumulated deficit of 12,843,924. The Company has not established sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs and will require additional capital to continue its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan to obtain such resources for the Company includes sales of equity instruments; traditional financing, such as loans; and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimum operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing this plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Note 3 Loan payable due to Eagle - JV partner July 17, 2020, the Company entered into a membership agreement with Eagle Equities LLC Eagle and Ikon Supplies Ikon to form a Nevada Limited Liability Company, HIE, LLC HIE for the purpose of procuring, funding the purchase of and sale of PPE (the Membership Agreement ). Subject to the provision of the Membership Agreement, the interest of any net profits would be shared 33.3 among each member. If there is a loss in some or all of the capital, the Company is contingently liable to contribute to repay 33.3 of the Origination Loan and Additional Contribution and of any losses of HIE. In addition, the Company is obliged to repay 1/3 of the loan contributed by Eagle or 1/3 of the capital paid by Eagle according to the Membership Agreement. HIE did not have any operating activities since July 2021. As a result, the Company s investment balance in HIE as of September 30, 2024 was 0, and the loan balance payable to joint venture partner Eagle totaled 442,251, unchanged since year 2021. Note 4 - Related Party Transactions Related party transactions are described in detail in Note 5, Note 6, Note 7, Note 8, and Note 10. 9 Table of Contents Note 5 Inventory Financing Payable related party On February 19, 2021, Steve Hall, a shareholder of the Company, advanced 1 million to the Company.

In addition to the principal amount of the advance, the related party will be entitled to 1/3 of the gross profit earned on the transaction. The terms of the agreement are non-interest bearing. The creditor is 100 at risk as this is a non-recourse funding vehicle. In June 2021 the Company cancelled the contemplated purchase of inventory and returned 500,000 to Mr. Hall. Mr. Hall agreed to allow the Company to retain the balance to fund future purchases and general operating expenses. On October 1, 2021, the Company and Steve Hall entered into a restated and amended promissory note, to consolidate and restate the terms pursuant to which Steve Hall had provided funds to the Company (the Consolidated Note ).

In addition to consolidating the advances singled out above, the Consolidated Note included the extension of a line of credit of up to 1,000,000, from Steve Hall to the Company. The principal amount of the Consolidated Note, excluding the 1,000,000 line of credit, was 1,105,000, payable on demand at any time after October 1, 2022 (the Due Date ), and accruing interest at a rate of 12 per year, if repaid within 90 days of the due date and 20 if repaid thereafter. Principal and interest due under the line of credit extended pursuant to the Consolidated Note would be added to the principal amount due under the Consolidated Note and be payable pursuant to the same terms. The line of credit was due and payable on the Due Date unless extended. At the option of holder, the Consolidated Note was convertible, at any time, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 0.02 per share. On April 1, 2024, the Company and Steve Hall entered into a debt consolidation agreement, which consolidated all amounts due by the Company to Steve Hall (the Debt Consolidation Agreement ), including amounts due under the Consolidated Note, which amounted to accrued interest of 240,274 and the principal balance of 500,000.

All principal disbursed under the line of credit would accrue interest and be payable on the same terms as principal due under the Consolidated Note. The line of credit expired on October 1, 2022, and was renewed and extended with same terms and a new maturity date of October 1, 2023. On April 1, 2024, the Company and Steve Hall entered into the Debt Consolidation Agreement, which consolidated all amounts due by the Company to Steve Hall under the line of credit. These amounted to accrued interest of 182,092 and the principal balance of 570,250. See note 11 Debt Consolidation Agreement. Note 7 Promissory Notes Payable related party On March 29, 2023, Steve Hall provided the Company with a loan in the principal amount of 1,000,000, as evidenced by a promissory note with an annual interest rate of 12 per year (the Steve Hall Note ). The purpose of the Steve Hall Note was to provide the Company with a funding source to make a follow-on investment in CNTNR USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation CNTNR ). On May 31, 2023 (or upon the closing of a debt financing), the Company would repay the outstanding principal balance of the Steve Hall Note to Steve Hall and transfer to him 90 of the shares of CNTNR, issued by CNTNR to the Company pursuant to the Company s investment in CNTNR, plus 90 of the CNTNR Warrants as described below in Note 9 - Note Receivable. On April 1, 2024, the Company and Steve Hall entered into the Debt Consolidation Agreement, which consolidated all amounts due by the Company to Steve Hall under the Steve Hall Note. These amounts included accrued interest of 170,183 and the principal balance of 1,708,000..

In the Amended CNTNR Note, the Company agreed to lend CNTNR the total principal amount of 1,000,000 Principal Amount with a commitment fee equivalent to 5 of the Principal Amount. CNTNR further agreed to pay the Company a monthly consulting fee of 5,000 beginning on March 1, 2023 that would continue until the Principal Amount was repaid. The balance of the consulting fee was recorded as an accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024, the accounts receivable has a zero balance. The Amended CNTNR Note had an annual interest rate of 12 and matured at the earlier of September 30, 2023, or the closing of a material debt or equity financing. Upon maturity of the Amended CNTNR Note, CNTNR would pay to the Company all outstanding Principal Amount and interest, plus any outstanding consulting fee and issue the Company 10 of the issued and outstanding shares of CNTNR (equivalent to 6,170,879 shares). Moreover, the Amended CNTNR Note includes warrant coverage of one warrant for every share issued in repayment of the Principal Amount at the closing of an intended merger with CNTNR which is equal to 6,170,879 warrants. The warrants will have a 30 discount rate to the current fair market price of the shares of CNTNR when exercised and will expire 36 months after April 6, 2023. On April 1, 2024, the Company assigned and transferred this note receivable to Steve Hall as part of the Debt Consolidation Agreement.

Based on our evaluation no material events have occurred that require disclosure. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion relates to the historical operations and financial statements of Hawkeye Systems, Inc. for the three months ended September 30, 2024 . Forward-Looking Statements The following Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report. The Management s Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words believe, plan, intend, anticipate, target, estimate, expect, and the like, and/or future-tense or conditional constructions will, may, could, should, etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those specifically addressed under the heading Risks Factors in our various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this quarterly report. The Company is currently looking for investment opportunities into target businesses in diversified industries, such as affordable housing development, and technology applications to mitigate the effects of climate change. Financial Condition and Results of Operations We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operations. We expect we will require additional capital to develop our business plan. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. We had no operating revenues, and cost of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Total operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 95,546 compared to 168,841 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of a decrease in professional fees - related party, management compensation, and general and administrative expenses. The Company s net loss was 156,720 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 214,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss for this period is primarily a result of operating expenses, and interest expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balance at September 30, 2024 was 7 compared to 50,296 at September 30, 2023. We do not believe these cash reserves are sufficient to cover our expenses for our operations for the next 12 months. We will require additional funding for our ongoing operations. During our first fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we received 55,600, and 450,000, from a promissory note issued by a related party. In addition, we intend to raise funds through the sale of equity and debt securities. We are a smaller reporting company and have accumulated losses to date. Under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence, we believe we will require additional funds over the next 12 months to complete our regulatory reporting and filings. However, we will require maximum participation through private placements, or alternative financing to implement our business plan. 14 Table of Contents There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business. Plan of Operation and Funding We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through equity offerings, warrant exercises, and related party advances in the near future. We have no guarantees or firm commitments that the related party advances will continue in the near future. Existing working capital, further advances, together with anticipated capital raises are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in raising enough capital, or that we will receive the cash flow required to fund our operations. We have no lines of credit with banking institutions or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through proceeds from convertible loans. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue our operations. Material Commitments As of the date of this quarterly report, we have entered into various commitments. For a discussion of the related items, please see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies. Purchase of Significant Equipment We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 15 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of the date of this quarterly report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Going Concern As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately 12,843,924 at September 30, 2024 and net loss from operations of 156,720 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We do not yet have a history of financial stability. Historically, the principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of equity securities, proceeds from convertible loans, and related party advances. In addition, the Company is in the development stage and has accumulated losses since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue operations is dependent on the success of Management s plans and raising of capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. We will require additional funding to finance our operations and regulatory filing obligations, as well as to identify, negotiate and materialize a business combination with a target business. We believe our current available cash may be insufficient to meet our cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to us, if at all. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates For a discussion of our accounting policies and related items, please see the Notes to the Financial Statements, included in Item 1. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In our review, we sought to find potential for material weaknesses in our financial controls, which is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in our accounting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, which include a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, whether unintentional errors or fraud. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our management, consisting of Corby Marshall as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(3) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) and financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as well as the guidance provided in SEC Release 33-8809. In such an evaluation, Mr. Marshall assessed daily interaction, self-assessment and other ongoing monitoring activities as evidence in the evaluation. Furthermore we sought to identify financial reporting risks, identify controls that adequately address financial reporting risks, considered entity level controls, reviewed the role of technology in our controls and reviewed the evidence available to support the assessment. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting on a timely basis information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act; and were not effective in assuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is actually disclosed or filed. Our management concluded that this is due to material weaknesses including (i) the Company having only two officers handling all financial transactions, (ii) lack of appropriate operational controls and consistency in providing our accounting personnel with financial information, (iii) incomplete financial statements on a daily basis and resulting errors in our underlying accounting system, (iv) lack of proper documentation of our assessment and evaluation, and (v) our determination that internal controls were ineffective due to the limited segregation of duties because of the limited management structure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 17 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 - Legal Proceedings From time to time the Company may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, we are not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this quarterly report, no director, officer, or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. We are not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our property that, in the opinion of management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.
