INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS 

References in this report
to the Company, COSG, we, us and our refer to Cosmos Group Holdings
Inc., a Nevada company (also known as Coinllectibles, Inc.), and all of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Where reference to a
specific entity is required, the name of such specific entity will be referenced. 

We are a Nevada holding
company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong and Singapore. Our investors hold shares of
common stock in Cosmos Group Holdings Inc., the Nevada holding company. This structure presents unique risks as our investors may never
directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiary and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our
cash flow needs. Our ability to obtain contributions from our subsidiaries are significantly affected by regulations promulgated by Hong
Kong and Singaporean authorities. Any change in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of new rules
and regulations may materially affect our operations and or the value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities
to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our structure,
please refer to Risk Factors Risks Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong . set forth in the Form 10-K filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on April 16, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). 

Cosmos Group Holdings Inc.
and our Hong Kong subsidiaries are not required to obtain permission or approval from the Chinese authorities including the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, the Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to operate our business or to issue securities to
foreign investors. However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the People s Republic of China the
PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign
ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject
to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that we inadvertently conclude
that such approvals are not required, that applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain
approvals in the future, or that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which would likely result in a material
change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept
foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions could cause the value of our common
stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies,
including the CSRC, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company s
securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly
decline or become worthless. 

There are prominent legal
and operational risks associated with our operations being in Hong Kong. For example, as a U.S.-listed Hong Kong public company,
we may face heightened scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value
of our common stock. It could also significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors
and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. We are subject to risks arising from the legal system
in China where there are risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws including where the Chinese government can change the
rules and regulations in China and Hong Kong, including the enforcement and interpretation thereof, at any time with little to no advance
notice and can intervene at any time with little to no advance notice. Changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M A
rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and Data Security Law, may target the Company s corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct
business in Hong Kong, accept foreign investments, or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. By way of example, the PRC government
initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including
cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable
interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly
enforcement. In April 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, which became effective in June 2020. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information
infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security.
On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments Draft Measures ), which required that, in addition to operator of critical information infrastructure, any
 data processor carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security should also be subject
to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when assessing the national security risks of the relevant
activities, including, among others, (i) the risk of core data, important data or a large amount of personal information being stolen,
leaked, destroyed, and illegally used or exited the country; and (ii) the risk of critical information infrastructure, core data, important
data or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled, or maliciously used by foreign governments after listing abroad.
The Cyberspace Administration of China has said that under the proposed rules companies holding data on more than 1,000,000 users must
now apply for cybersecurity approval when seeking listings in other nations because of the risk that such data and personal information
could be affected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign governments, The cybersecurity review will also investigate
the potential national security risks from overseas IPOs. On January 4, 2022, the CAC, in conjunction with 12 other government departments,
issued the New Measures for Cybersecurity Review (the New Measures on January 4, 2022. The New Measures amends the
Draft Measures released on July 10, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022. 

i 

The business of our subsidiaries
are not subject to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, given that: (i) we do not have one million individual
online users of our products and services in Hong Kong; (ii) we do not possess a large amount of personal information in our business
operations. In addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level
of our revenues which provided from us and audited by our auditor and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement
any acquisition of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than Renminbi RMB 400 million. Currently, these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operations, the ability to accept
foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions
are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new
laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact
such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list
our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks the Company is facing and the offering associated
with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to Risk Factors Risks Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong . 
set forth in the Form 10-K. 

The recent joint statement
by the SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB ), and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their
auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the HFCAA
if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor, and that as a result, an exchange may determine
to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act which would
reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two
thus reducing the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or being delisted. On December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted rules
to implement the HFCAA. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued its report notifying the Commission that it is unable to inspect or investigate
completely accounting firms headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong due to positions taken by authorities in mainland China and Hong
Kong. Our auditor is based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and is subject to PCAOB s inspection. It is not subject to the determinations
announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. However, in the event the Malaysian authorities subsequently take a position disallowing
the PCAOB to inspect our auditor, then we would need to change our auditor to avoid having our securities delisted. Furthermore, due to
the recent developments in connection with the implementation of the HFCAA, we cannot assure you whether the SEC or other regulatory authorities
would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and
quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates
to the audit of our financial statements. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access
to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous
determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB s access in the
future, the PCAOB will consider the need to issue a new determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event it is later determined
that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor, then such lack of inspection could cause our securities to
be delisted from the stock exchange. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
and on December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by President Biden, which contained, among other things,
an identical provision to Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and amended the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject
to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time before our Ordinary Shares may be prohibited from
trading or delisted. Please see Risk Factors- The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) to be permitted to inspect the issuer s public accounting firm within three years. This three-year period
will be shortened to two years if the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act is enacted. There are uncertainties under
the PRC Securities Law relating to the procedures and requisite timing for the U.S. securities regulatory agencies to conduct investigations
and collect evidence within the territory of the PRC. If the U.S. securities regulatory agencies are unable to conduct such investigations,
they may suspend or de-register our registration with the SEC and delist our securities from applicable trading market within the U.S . 
set forth in the Form 10-K. 

ii 

In addition to the foregoing
risks, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties arising from doing business in Hong Kong as summarized below and
in Risk Factors Risks Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

Adverse changes in economic
and political policies of the PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on overall economic growth in China and Hong Kong,
which could materially and adversely affect our business. Please see Risk Factors-We face the risk that changes in the policies
of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in Hong Kong and the profitability of
such business. and Substantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic policies
of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in
the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

We are a holding company
with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong and Singapore. This structure presents unique risks
as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong and Singapore subsidiaries and will be dependent upon contributions
from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have
a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future; you should
not buy our stock if you expect dividends. Please see Risk Factors- Because our holding company structure creates restrictions
on the payment of dividends, our ability to pay dividends is limited. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

There is a possibility
that the PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into
our business or for the payment of dividends. We rely on dividends from our Hong Kong subsidiaries for our cash and financing
requirements, such as the funds necessary to service any debt we may incur. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect
our ability to finance our cash requirements, service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our
shareholders . Please see Risk Factors - PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities
by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we
receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our Hong Kong subsidiaries,
which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business. Risk Factors -
Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends or other cash payments, our ability to pay
dividends or make other payments is limited. and Transfers of Cash to and from our Subsidiaries. set
forth in the Form 10-K. 

PRC regulation of loans to
and direct investments in PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering
to make loans or additional capital contributions to our operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong. Substantial uncertainties exist with respect
to the interpretation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate
governance and business operations. Please see Risk Factors- PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities
by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive
from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our Hong Kong subsidiaries, which could
materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand business. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

In light of China s
extension of its authority into Hong Kong, the Chinese government can change Hong Kong s rules and regulations at any time with
little or no advance notice, and can intervene and influence our operations and business activities in Hong Kong. We are currently not
required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges. However, if our subsidiaries or the holding company were
required to obtain approval in the future, or we erroneously conclude that approvals were not required, or we were denied permission from
Chinese authorities to operate or to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on a U.S. exchange and the value
of our common stock would likely significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors.
There is a risk that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings
conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in Hong Kong-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or
the value of our securities. Further, any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are
conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers would likely significantly limit or completely hinder our ability
to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
Please see Risk Factors-We face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact
upon the business we may be able to conduct in the Hong Kong and the profitability of such business . and Substantial
uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations
could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations
and financial condition . and The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which
we must conduct our business activities. We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges.
However, to the extent that the Chinese government exerts more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in
China-based issuers over time and if our PRC subsidiaries or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future and were
denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange and the
value of our common stock may significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. 
set forth in the Form 10-K. 

iii 

Governmental control of currency
conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment. 

We may become subject to
a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. We may be liable for
improper use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers. Please see Risk Factors- The Chinese government
exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. We are currently not required to obtain
approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges. However, to the extent that the Chinese government exerts more control over
offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers over time and if our PRC subsidiaries or the holding company
were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will
not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange and the value of our common stock may significantly decline or become worthless, which
would materially affect the interest of the investors . set forth in the Form 10-K. 

Under the Enterprise Income
Tax Law of the PRC EIT Law ), we may be classified as a Resident Enterprise of China. Such classification
will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders. Please see Risk Factors- Our global
income may be subject to PRC taxes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

Failure to comply with PRC
regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident Shareholders
to personal liability, may limit our ability to acquire Hong Kong and PRC companies or to inject capital into our Hong Kong subsidiary,
may limit the ability of our Hong Kong subsidiaries to distribute profits to us or may otherwise materially and adversely affect us. 

You may be subject to PRC
income tax on dividends from us or on any gain realized on the transfer of shares of our common stock. Please see Risk Factors-
Dividends payable to our foreign investors and gains on the sale of our shares of common stock by our foreign investors may become subject
to tax by the PRC. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

We face uncertainties with
respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies. Please see Risk
Factors- We and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises
by their non-PRC holding companies. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

We are organized under the
laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through a number of subsidiaries organized under the laws
of foreign jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of
U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, bring actions in Hong Kong against us or our management
or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries. Please see Risk Factors-
It may be difficult for stockholders to enforce any judgment obtained in the United States against us, which may limit the remedies otherwise
available to our stockholders . set forth in the Form 10-K. 

iv 

U.S. regulatory bodies may
be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China. 

There are significant uncertainties
under the EIT Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiary, and dividends payable by our PRC subsidiary to our
offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain treaty benefits. Please see Risk Factors- Our global income may be
subject to PRC taxes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations . 
set forth in the Form 10-K.

statement to the Company, COSG, we, us and our refer to Cosmos Group
Holdings Inc., a Nevada company and all of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Where reference to a specific entity is required,
the name of such specific entity will be referenced. 

Transfers of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries 

Cosmos Group Holdings Inc.
is a Nevada holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in Hong Kong primarily through our subsidiaries in
Hong Kong and Singapore. We may rely on dividends or other transfers of cash or assets to be made by our Hong Kong and Singapore subsidiaries
to fund our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders,
to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. If our Hong Kong and Singapore subsidiaries incur debt on their own
behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.
To date, our subsidiaries have not made any transfers, dividends or distributions to Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. and Cosmos Group Holdings
Inc. has not made any transfers, dividends or distributions of cash flows or other assets to our subsidiaries. 

We do not intend to make
dividends or distributions to investors of Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. in the foreseeable future. 

We currently intend to retain
all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying
any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual requirements, business
prospects and other factors the board of directors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments. 

Cosmos Group Holdings
Inc. (Nevada corporation) 

Subject to the Nevada Revised
Statutes and our bylaws, our board of directors may authorize and declare a dividend to shareholders at such time and of such an amount
as they think fit if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately following the dividend the value of our assets will exceed
our liabilities and we will be able to pay our debts as they become due. There is no further Nevada statutory restriction on the amount
of funds which may be distributed by us by dividend. Accordingly, Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. is permitted under the Nevada laws
to provide funding to our subsidiaries in Singapore and Hong Kong through loans or capital contributions without restrictions on the amount
of the funds, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements. 

Singapore and Hong Kong
Subsidiaries 

Our Hong Kong subsidiaries
and our Singapore subsidiary are also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong and Singapore to provide funding to Cosmos Group Holdings
Inc. through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. If our Hong Kong and Singapore subsidiaries incur
debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions
to us. To date, our subsidiaries have not made any transfers, dividends or distributions to Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. and Cosmos Group
Holdings Inc. has not made any transfers, dividends or distributions to our subsidiaries. 

v 

Under the current practice
of the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, no tax is payable in Hong Kong in respect of dividends paid by us. The laws and regulations
of the PRC do not currently have any material impact on transfer of cash from Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. to our Hong Kong subsidiaries
or from our Hong Kong subsidiaries to Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. There are no restrictions or limitation under the laws of Hong Kong imposed
on the conversion of Hong Kong dollar HKD into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of Hong Kong or
across borders and to U.S. investors. 

There is a possibility that
the PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into our business
or for the payment of dividends. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our cash requirements,
service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders. Please see Risk Factors - Risk Factors -
PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion
may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from offshore financing activities to make loans to or make additional capital
contributions to our Hong Kong subsidiary, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand
business. Risk Factors - Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends or other
cash payments, our ability to pay dividends or make other payments is limited. set forth in the Form 10-K. 

Current PRC regulations permit
PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to Hong Kong subsidiaries only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with
Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10 of
its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50 of its registered capital. Each of
such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although
the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be
used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective
companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As of the date of this report,
we do not have any PRC subsidiaries. 

The PRC government imposes
controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience
difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency to finance our cash requirements,
service debt or make dividend or other distributions to our shareholders. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their
own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our
subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock. 

Cash dividends, if any, on
our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay
to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of
up to 10 . 

If in the future we have
PRC subsidiaries, certain payments from such PRC subsidiaries to Hong Kong subsidiaries will be subject to PRC taxes, including business
taxes and VAT. As of the date of this report, we do not have any PRC subsidiaries and our Hong Kong subsidiaries have not made any transfers,
dividends or distributions nor do we expect to make such transfers, dividends or distributions in the foreseeable future. 

Pursuant to the Arrangement
between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income,
or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, the 10 withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5 if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns no
less than 25 of a PRC entity. However, the 5 withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and certain requirements must be satisfied,
including, without limitation, that (a) the Hong Kong entity must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong
Kong entity must directly hold no less than 25 share ownership in the PRC entity during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt
of the dividends. In current practice, a Hong Kong entity must obtain a tax resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply
for the 5 lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case

CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are not historical facts, and involve risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. All statements, other than statements
of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in the Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the Company s financial position, business strategy
and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, events or developments which the Company expects or anticipates will
or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof); expansion
and growth of the Company s business and operations; and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are
based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current
conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether
actual results or developments will conform with the Company s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including general economic, market and business conditions; the business opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented
to and pursued by the Company; changes in laws or regulation and other factors, most of which are beyond the control of the Company. 

These forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of predictive, future-tense or forward-looking terminology, such as believes, anticipates, 
 expects, estimates, plans, may, will, or similar terms. These statements
appear in a number of places in this filing and include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company,
and its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) trends affecting the Company s financial condition or
results of operations for its limited history; (ii) the Company s business and growth strategies; and, (iii) the Company s
financing plans. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve
significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements
as a result of various factors. Such factors that could adversely affect actual results and performance include, but are not limited to,
the Company s limited operating history, potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results and expenses, government regulation,
technological change and competition. For information identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, please refer to our filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, including our Current Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2024. 

Consequently, all of the
forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the
actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the
expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The Company assumes no obligations to update any such
forward-looking statements.

for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had an accumulated deficit of at September 30, 2024. The continuation
of the Company as a going concern in the next twelve months is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. Management
believes the Company is currently pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will
be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations. 

These and other factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company
not being able to continue as a going concern.

Overview 

We are a Nevada holding company
with operations conducted through our subsidiaries based in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is engaged
in two business segments: (i) the physical arts and collectibles business, and (ii) the financing/money lending business. 

Through our physical arts
and collectibles business, we provide authentication, valuation and certification AVC service, sale and purchase, hire
purchase, financing, custody, security and exhibition CSE services to art and collectibles buyers through traditional
methods as well as through leveraging blockchain technology through the creation of Digital Ownership Tokens DOTs ). 

DOT is an integrated, best
in class, smart contract for art and collectible pieces. We use blockchain technology to help resolve the issues of provenance, authenticity
and ownership in the arts and collectibles market. For each art or collectible piece, we create an individual DOT that includes
an independent appraisal, a 3D rendering of the piece, high-definition photo of the piece, AI recognition file of the piece and a set
of legal documents to provide proof of ownership and provenance of the piece to the blockchain. Our DOTs are intended to provide assurance
on the authenticity of art or collectible pieces as well as act as a record of ownership transfers using blockchain technology to establish
provenance of the piece. As the owner of a DOT, the buyer will be able to take the necessary legal action against those who
breach the digital ownership rights. We initially intend to focus on customers located in Hong Kong and expand throughout Asia and the
rest of the world. 

We conduct our DOT operations
from Singapore. In Singapore, cryptocurrencies and the custodianship of such cryptocurrencies are not specifically regulated. Cryptocurrency
exchanges and trading of cryptocurrencies are legal, but not considered legal tender. To the extent that cryptocurrencies or tokens are
considered capital market products such as securities, spot foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and the like, they will
be subject to the jurisdiction of the Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS ), Securities and Futures Act, anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. To the extent that tokens are deemed digital payment tokens, 
they will be subject to the Payment Services Act of 2019 which, among other things, require compliance with anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. According to the Payment Services Act of 2019, digital payment token 
means any digital representation of value (other than an excluded digital representation of value) that (a) is expressed as a unit; (b)
is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; (c) is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange
accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; (d) can be transferred,
stored or traded electronically; and (e) satisfies such other characteristics as the Authority may prescribe. Our DOTs, therefore, are
not securities or digital payment tokens subject to these acts. 

We receive fiat and cryptocurrency
from the sale of art and collectibles and collection of transaction fees derived from the secondary and subsequent sales of the collectibles.
In order to minimize the risk of price fluctuation in cryptocurrency, after we receive the cryptocurrencies, we will recognize the value
by immediately exchange them into US dollar or stable currencies that are pegged with US dollar.

There may be prominent risks
associated with our operations being in Hong Kong. We may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government
including the risk that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which may result in a material change in our
operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments,
and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions could change the value of our common stock to significantly
decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese
Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the
Company s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which may cause the value of our securities to
significantly decline or become worthless. 

As a U.S.-listed company
with operations in Hong Kong, we may face heightened scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change
in our operations and the value of our common stock. It could also significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue
to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Additionally, changes
in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M A rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and the soon to be effective Data Security Law,
may target the Company s corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong, accept foreign investments,
or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and the offering associated with
our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to Risk Factors Risk Factors Relating to Our Operations in Hong Kong as
disclosed in our set forth in the Company s Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

Commentary on our Revenue 
an overview 

The total revenue for 2024
Q2 was 19,185 from the DOT business segment. Our DOT revenue are primarily attributable to consultancy service. 

Commentary on DOT Revenue
 our key growth driver 

As a whole, the 2024 Q2 revenue
growth is in line with Management s expectations. Our business model focuses on the rights of ownership through a digital ownership
token attached to physical art or some other collectible with real world tangible value. The business is fundamentally different from
the model NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible that list third party NFTs for sale. Given the business model targets the physical
art and collectibles market, the relative growth in the overall art markets sales at major auction houses and art fairs, we were less
affected by the recent negative sentiment in the crypto and NFT markets. 

We currently generate revenue
from primary sales, or sales of new collectibles DOTs and resale transaction fees between 8 and 10 each time the DOT is sold in the
secondary market. Because each collectible has the potential of generating revenue beyond the initial sale, we intend to focus on bringing
quality primary sales DOT for long term ownership as well as resale potential to market. A key focus of the company is to work with appropriate
partners to mint and sell DOTs attached to high quality collectibles in an increasing range of art such as photographs and sculptures
and a range of other market segments including sports. We feel that DOTs are an attractive way for artists, galleries, auction houses
to engage with existing and new buyer bases in addition to their current sales strategies. We see further opportunity to engage with partners
to support strategies using applications of DOTs such as in the luxury goods segment. 

The sports collectibles
market is another area of potential application for DOTs. According to Market Decipher, the market value of sports collectibles 
which is currently at US 26.1billion, is expected to reach US 227 billion by 2032. Sports related NFTs, with a current estimated market
value of US 1.4 billion, is also expected to reach an estimated market value of US 92 billion by 2032. 

Other Activities 

In March 2022, we launched
a new sports division in our MetaMall and partnering with a former NBA basketball player as president of Coinllectible Sports. We hope
to exploit our DOT technology and the metaverse to bring innovation to the sports space, bridge the intersection of our DOT technology
and Sports memorabilia to improve experiences for fans, athletes, teams, events and partners.

Results of Operations. 

The recent outbreak of COVID-19,
which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic
activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout Asian region. National, regional
and local governments took a variety of actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, including office and store closures, quarantining suspected
COVID-19 patients, and capacity limitations. These developments have significantly impacted the results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows of the Company included in this reporting. The impact included the difficulties of working remotely from home including
slow Internet connection, the inability of our accounting and financial officers to collaborate as effectively as they would otherwise
have in an office environment and issues arising from mandatory state quarantines. 

While it is not possible
at this time to estimate with sufficient certainty the impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company s business, the continued
spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments could disrupt the operation of the Company s
business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global and domestic
economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s business and financial condition, including on its potential
to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary precautionary measures
intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, and discouraging
employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company s business. These measures are
continuing. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company s results will depend on future developments that are
highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions
to contain its impact. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had a working capital of 58,037,288 and accumulated deficit of 210,258,497. As a result, our continuation as a going concern is
dependent upon improving our profitability and continued financial support from our stockholders or other capital sources. Management
believes that continued financial support from existing shareholders and external financing will provide the additional cash necessary
to meet our obligations as they become due. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going
concern.

support operations. G A expenses from continued operations decreased by approximately 11,782,479 in the nine months ended September
30, 2024 from 15,425,508 for the same period of 2023. 

Other expenses 

Total other expenses from
continuing operations of 4,970 and 48,799,514 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenses
primary include interest income, convertible notes interest expense, loan interest expense and sundry income. 

Income Tax Expense 

We incurred income tax expense
from continuing operations of 84 and 0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 28,796 and 57,888. 

We expect to incur significantly
greater expenses in the near future as we develop our arts and collectibles technology business or enter into strategic partnerships.
We also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff, add infrastructure,
and incur additional costs related to being reporting act company, including directors and officers insurance and increased
professional fees. 

We have never paid dividends
on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently,
we do not expect to pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

Going Concern Uncertainties 

Our continuation as a going
concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital
in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings,
lease liability and short-term and long-term debts. In addition, with respect to the ongoing and evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,
which was designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, the outbreak has caused substantial disruption
in international economies and global trades and if repercussions of the outbreak are prolonged, could have a significant adverse impact
on our business. Given the addition political and public health challenges, our ability to obtain external financing or financing from
existing shareholders to fund our working capital needs has been materially and adversely impacted, and there can be no assurance that
we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of
liquidity discussed below are adequate to support general operations for at least the next 12 months.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

For a detailed description
of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of the Company, please refer to Part II, ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023 filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. 

The Company has reviewed
all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements
may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. 

ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4 Controls and Procedure 

Conclusion Regarding the
Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), under the supervision of and with the participation
of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, subject to limitations
as noted below, as of September 30, 2024, and during the period prior to and including the date of this report, were effective to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Inherent Limitations 

Because of its inherent limitations,
our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Subject to the foregoing
disclosure, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
