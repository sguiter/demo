 TOTAL Upon the Corporation s determination that a modified loan has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. Credit Quality Indicators: The Corporation categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Corporation analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial loans, with an outstanding balance greater than thousand. Any consumer loans outstanding to a borrower who had commercial loans analyzed will be similarly risk rated. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Corporation uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and debt service capacity of the borrower or of any pledged collateral. These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses which have clearly jeopardized repayment of principal and interest as originally intended. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some future loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those graded substandard, with the added characteristic that the severity of the weaknesses makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable or improbable based upon currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Furthermore, non-homogeneous loans which were not individually analyzed, but are 90+ days past due or on non-accrual are classified as substandard. Loans included in homogeneous pools, such as residential or consumer may be classified as substandard due to 90+ days delinquency, non-accrual status, bankruptcy, or loan restructuring.

 The Corporation evaluates the credit quality of its other loan portfolios, which includes residential real estate, consumer and lease financing loans, based primarily on the aging status of the loan and payment activity. Accordingly, loans on non-accrual status and loans past due or more and still accruing interest are considered to be nonperforming for purposes of credit quality evaluation.

The investment securities portfolio is evaluated for impairment related to credit losses by segregating the portfolio into general segments. In evaluating for impairment, management considers the reason for the decline, the extent of the decline, the duration of the decline and whether the Corporation intends to sell a security or is more likely than not to be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost. If an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security s amortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Gross unrealized losses on investment securities were million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. Management believes these losses represent negative adjustments to market value relative to the interest rate environment reflecting the increase in market rates and not losses related to the creditworthiness of the issuer. The portfolio contains primarily government agency, agency backed mortgage backed securities MBS ), and collateralized mortgage obligations CMO ), which are issued by government sponsored enterprises and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Secondarily, the Corporation invests in municipal securities issued by state and local governments. Of these, almost half are either insured or contain state enhancements. On the remaining, credit is monitored by the investment committee. Based upon our review of the issuers, we do not believe these investments to be other than temporarily impaired. Management does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before their anticipated recovery.

At September 30, 2024 other real estate owned was comprised of thousand from commercial loans and thousand from residential loans. Other real estate owned at December 31, 2023 with a value of thousand was reduced by thousand for fair value adjustment. At December 31, 2023 other real estate owned was comprised of thousand from commercial loans and thousand from residential loans. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing those loans, and is determined using several methods. Generally the fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. Appraisals for real estate generally use three methods to derive value: cost, sales or market comparison and income approach. The cost method bases value on the cost to replace current property. The market comparison evaluates the sales price of similar properties in the same market area. The income approach considers net operating income generated by the property and the investor s required return. The final fair value is based on a reconciliation of these three approaches. If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis, a broker s opinion of value, the net present value of future cash flows, or an observable market price from an active market. Fair value of other real estate is based upon the current appraised values of the properties as determined by qualified licensed appraisers and the Company s judgment of other relevant market conditions. Appraisals are obtained annually and reductions in value are recorded as a valuation through a charge to expense. The primary unobservable input used by management in estimating fair value are additional discounts to the appraised value to consider market conditions and the age of the appraisal, which are based on management s past experience in resolving these types of properties. These discounts range from to with an average discount of . Values for non-real estate collateral, such as business equipment, are based on appraisals performed by qualified licensed appraisers or the customers financial statements. Values for non real estate collateral use much higher discounts than real estate collateral. Other real estate and individually evaluated loans carried at fair value are primarily comprised of smaller balance properties.

For fixed-rate, collectively evaluated loans or deposits, variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, and for longer-term borrowings, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and considering credit risk. The valuation of individually evaluated loans was described previously. Loan fair value estimates represent an exit price. Fair values of loans held for sale are based on market bids on the loans or similar loans.

 Repurchase Agreements The Corporation enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase. The amounts received under these agreements represent short-term borrowings and are reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The securities underlying these agreements are included in investment securities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has no control over the market value of the securities, which fluctuates due to market conditions. However, the Corporation is obligated to promptly transfer additional securities if the market value of the securities falls below the repurchase agreement price. The Corporation manages this risk by maintaining an unpledged securities portfolio that it believes is sufficient to cover a decline in the market value of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

 Service charges on deposits : The Corporation earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Corporation fulfills the customer s request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Corporation satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer s account balance. Trust and financial services : The Corporation earns asset management fees from its contracts with trust customers to manage assets for investment, and/or to transact on their accounts. These fees are primarily earned over time as the Corporation provides the contracted monthly or quarterly services and are generally assessed based on a tiered scale of the market value of assets under management at month-end. Fees that are transaction based, including trade execution services, are recognized at the point in time that the transaction is executed, i.e. the trade date. Other related services provided and the fees the Corporation earns, which are based on a fixed fee schedule, are recognized when the services are rendered. Interchange income : The Corporation earns interchange fees from debit and credit cardholder transactions conducted through the payment network. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder. Gains/Losses on sales of OREO : The Corporation records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. When the Corporation finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Corporation assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable. Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Corporation adjusts the transaction price and related gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present.

 and right-of-use assets totaling related to these leases. At December 31, 2023, the Corporation had lease liabilities totaling and right-of-use assets totaling related to these leases. Lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are reflected in other liabilities and other assets, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was years and the weighted average discount rate used in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was . The calculated amount of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Corporation s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Corporation s discretion. If at lease inception, the Corporation considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Corporation will include the extended term in the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset. Regarding the discount rate, the new standard requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Corporation utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term. The following table represents lease costs and other lease information. As the Corporation elected, not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for them as a single lease component, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance and utilities. Lease costs were as follows: Short-term lease cost Variable lease cost Total lease cost Other information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities The right-of-use assets obtained above includes million in assets acquired in the SimplyBank acquisition.

 per share in cash. The aggregate value of the transaction was approximately million. Acquisition-related costs of million are included in the Corporation s income statement for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024. Goodwill of 10.3 million arising from the acquisition consisted largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the operations of the companies. The goodwill value is subject to change pending receipt of the final valuation. The goodwill for SimplyBank is deductible for income tax purposes as the transaction was accounted for as a taxable acquisition. The following table summarizes the consideration paid and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date. Fair value of total consideration transferred Assets acquired Cash Investment securities available-for-sale Federal funds sold Bank owned life insurance Federal Home Loan Bank stock Loans Premises and equipment Core deposit intangibles Other assets Total assets acquired Liabilities assumed Deposits FHLB advances Other liabilities Total liabilities assumed Net identifiable assets Goodwill The fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain receivables that were not considered impaired as of the acquisition date. The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted contractual cash flows. However, the Corporation believes that all contractual cash flows related to these financial instruments will be collected. As such, these receivables were not considered impaired at the acquisition date and were not subject to guidance relating to purchase credit deteriorated loans, which have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination. The fair value of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration was million on the date of acquisition. The gross contractual amounts receivable relating to the purchased financial assets with credit deterioration was million. The Corporation estimates, on the date of acquisition, that million of the contractual cash flows specific to the purchased financial assets with credit deterioration will not be collected.

 ITEMS 2. and 3. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The purpose of this discussion is to point out key factors in the Corporation s recent performance compared with earlier periods. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page three of this report. All figures are for the consolidated entities. It is presumed the readers of these financial statements and of the following narrative have previously read the Corporation s financial statements for 2023 in the 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as representing management s views as of any subsequent date. The forward-looking statements are based on management s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation, the Corporation s ability to effectively execute its business plans; changes in general economic and financial market conditions; changes in interest rates; changes in the competitive environment; continuing consolidation in the financial services industry; new litigation or changes in existing litigation; losses, customer bankruptcy, claims and assessments; changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the Corporation s business; and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements is available in the Corporation s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of these filings are available at no cost on the SEC s Web site at www.sec.gov or on the Corporation s Web site at www.first-online.com. Management may elect to update forward-looking statements at some future point; however, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. Critical Accounting Policies Certain of the Corporation s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Corporation s financial condition and results of operations, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, without limitation, changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for credit losses and the valuation of goodwill and valuing investment securities. See further discussion of these critical accounting policies in the 2023 Form 10-K. Allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents management s estimate of expected losses inherent within the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors: reviews and evaluations of specific loans, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, nonperforming loans, determination of acquired loans as purchase credit deteriorated, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Loans are individually evaluated when they do not share risk characteristics with other loans in the respective pool. Loans evaluated individually are excluded from the collective evaluation. Management elected the collateral dependent practical expedient upon adoption of ASC 326. Expected credit losses on individually evaluated loans are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. Management utilizes a cohort methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. This method identifies and captures the balance of a pool of loans with similar risk characteristics, as of a particular point in time to form a cohort, then tracks the respective losses generated by that cohort of loans over their remaining life. The cohorts track loan balances and historical loss experience since 2008, and management extends the look back period each quarter to capture all available data points in the historical loss rate calculation. The quantitative component of the ACL involves assumptions that require a significant level of estimation; these include historical losses as a predictor of future performance, appropriateness of selected delay periods, and the reasonableness of the portfolio segmentation. A historical data set is expected to provide the best indication of future credit performance. Delay periods represent the amount of time it takes a cohort of loans to become seasoned, or incur sufficient attrition through pay downs, renewals, or charge-offs. Portfolio segmentation relates to the pooling of loans with similar risk characteristics, such as industry types, collateral, and consumer purpose.

Table of Contents 
 On an annual basis, in the first quarter, management performs a recalibration of the delay periods and portfolio segmentation to determine whether they are reasonable and appropriate based on the information available at that time. Management considers qualitative adjustments to expected credit loss estimates for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. Where past performance may not be representative of future losses, loss rates are adjusted for qualitative and economic forecast factors. Management uses the peak three consecutive quarter net charge off rate to capture maximum potential volatility over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Historical losses utilized in setting the qualitative factor ranges are anchored to 2008 and may be supplemented by peer information when needed. The qualitative factor ranges are recalibrated annually to capture recent behavior that is indicative of the credit profile of the current portfolio. Qualitative factors include items, such as changes in lending policies or procedures, asset specific risks, and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts. Economic indicators utilized in forecasting include unemployment rate, gross domestic product, housing starts, and interest rates. Management uses a two-year reasonable and supportable period across all loan segments to forecast economic conditions. Management believes the two-year time horizon aligns with available industry guidance and various forecasting sources. Economic forecast adjustments are overlaid onto historical loss rates. As such, reversion from forecast rates to historical loss rates is immediate. The ACL and allowance for unfunded commitments were 46.2 million and 1.8 million, respectively at September 30, 2024, compared to 39.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively at December 31, 2023. The qualitative amount of the reserve increased 1.6 million to 12.6 million. The quantitative amount is 33.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 28.4 million at December 31, 2023. There was a decrease of 200 thousand in the allowance for unfunded commitments. See additional discussion of ACL in the Allowance for Credit Losses section below. Based on management s analysis of the current portfolio, management believes the allowance is adequate. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, historical loss experience, or the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses and the associated provision for credit losses. As management monitors these changes, as well as those factors discussed above, adjustments may be recorded to the allowance for credit losses and the associated provision for credit losses in the future. Summary of Operating Results Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.7 million, compared to 16.3 million for the same period in 2023. Basic earnings per share decreased to 0.74 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.37 for the same period in 2023. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.64 and 6.39 respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.35 and 13.19 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.0 million, compared to 48.3 million for the same period in 2023. Basic earnings per share decreased to 2.63 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4.02 for the same period in 2023. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.82 and 7.80 respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.33 and 12.98 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In light of events in the banking sector, including bank failures, continuing interest rate activity and recessionary concerns, the Corporation has proactively positioned the balance sheet to mitigate the risks affecting the Corporation and the overall banking industry in order to serve its clients and communities. Liquidity remains strong, with cash and available for sale securities representing approximately 24.6 of assets at September 30, 2024. The Corporation maintains the ability to access considerable sources of contingent liquidity at the Federal Home Loan Bank and several correspondent banks. Management considers the Corporation s current liquidity position to be adequate to meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Refer to the section Liquidity Risk for additional information. Capital remains strong, with ratios of the Corporation, and its subsidiary bank, well above the standards to be considered well-capitalized under regulatory requirements. Refer to the section Capital Adequacy , included elsewhere in this report for additional details.

 Asset quality remains solid, with a non-performing asset ratio of 0.31 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and net charge-offs of 0.43 to average loans and leases, reflecting the Company's disciplined underwriting and conservative lending philosophy which has supported the Corporation s strong credit performance during prior financial crises. Refer to the section Non-Performing Loan for additional information. 
 The Corporation will continue its safe and sound banking practices, but the continuing impact of the 2023 crisis and further extent on the Corporation s operations and financial results for the remainder of 2024 is uncertain and cannot be predicted. The primary components of income and expense affecting net income are discussed in the following analysis. Net Interest Income The Corporation s primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and other investments and the interest paid for deposits and other sources of funds. Net interest income increased 6.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 47.2 million from 41.2 million in the same period in 2023. The net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is 3.78 compared to 3.74 for the same period in 2023, a 1.16 increase. Net interest income decreased 2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 125.4 million from 127.7 million in the same period in 2023. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is 3.63 compared to 3.83 for the same period in 2023. The increase in yields on net loans and leases of 44 basis points is the primary contributor to the improved yield on average earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was due to market conditions as a result of Federal Reserve interest rate increases. Comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits increased 72 basis points, due to rate competition in the market. For the same period discussed above, interest paid on other borrowings increased 99 basis points due to higher borrowing rates. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.2 million compared to 11.6 million for the same period in 2023. Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.6 million compared to 31.5 million for the same period in 2023. Non-Interest Expenses The Corporation s non-interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 38.6 million compared to 32.3 million for the same period in 2023. The Corporation s non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 8.7 million to 104.6 milllion compared to the same period in 2023. This includes 1.7 million of acquisition related expenses, as well as an overall increase in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition. Allowance for Credit Losses The Corporation s provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 9.4 million, compared to provision of 1.2 million for the same period of 2023. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 were 4.6 million compared to net charge-offs of 2.1 million for the same period of 2023. The provision for credit losses increased 9.4 million to 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 4.8 million for the same period in 2023. Net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 increased 5.2 million to 10.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. The Corporation recorded 5.5 million in Day 2 provision on non-PCD loans acquired from SimplyBank. Additionally, the increase in provision as well as charge-offs were related to one previously identified credit, reflecting further deterioration in collateral values in the quarter. No further losses are expected on this credit. Based on management s analysis of the current portfolio, an evaluation that includes consideration of changes in CECL model assumptions of credit quality, economic conditions, and loan composition, management believes the allowance is adequate. In the first nine months of 2024, no significant changes were made.

 Income Tax Expense The Corporation s effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 16.44 compared to 17.37 for the same period in 2023. Pretax income for the first nine months in 2023 was significantly higher than pretax income for first nine months in 2024. Since our permanent differences remained similar, income was the driving factor for the decrease in effective tax rate. Non-performing Loans Non-performing loans consist of (1) non-accrual loans on which the ultimate collectability of the full amount of interest is uncertain, and (2) loans past due ninety days or more as to principal or interest. Non-performing loans decreased to 14.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 24.6 million at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans increased 12.3 compared to 12.6 million as of September 30, 2023. A summary of non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 follows: 

(000's) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Non-accrual loans 12,617 23,596 Accruing loans past due over 90 days 1,517 960 14,134 24,556 Ratio of the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans 326.7 161.9 The following loan categories comprise significant components of the nonperforming non-restructured loans:

Responsibility for management of these functions resides with the Asset Liability Committee. The primary goal of the Asset Liability Committee is to maximize net interest income within the interest rate risk limits approved by the Board of Directors. Interest Rate Risk Management considers interest rate risk to be the Corporation s most significant market risk. Interest rate risk is the exposure to changes in net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Consistency in the Corporation s net interest income is largely dependent on the effective management of this risk. The Asset Liability position is measured using sophisticated risk management tools, including earning simulation and market value of equity sensitivity analysis. These tools allow management to quantify and monitor both short-term and long-term exposure to interest rate risk. Simulation modeling measures the effects of changes in interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve and the effects of embedded options on net interest income. This measure projects earnings in the various environments over the next three years. It is important to note that measures of interest rate risk have limitations and are dependent on various assumptions. These assumptions are 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely predict the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, frequency and amount of interest rate changes as well as overall market conditions. The Committee has performed a thorough analysis of these assumptions and believes them to be valid and theoretically sound. These assumptions are continuously monitored for behavioral changes. The Corporation from time to time utilizes derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Management continuously evaluates the merits of such interest rate risk products but does not anticipate the use of such products to become a major part of the Corporation s risk management strategy. The table below shows the Corporation s estimated sensitivity profile as of September 30, 2024. The change in interest rates assumes a parallel shift in interest rates of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. Given a 100 basis point increase in rates, net interest income would decrease 1.55 over the next 12 months and increase 1.09 over the following 12 months. Given a 100 basis point decrease in rates, net interest income would increase 5.96 over the next 12 months and increase 2.74 over the following 12 months. These estimates assume all rate changes occur overnight and management takes no action as a result of this change. 

Basis Point Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Interest Rate Change 12 months 24 months 36 months Down 300 6.88 (2.95) (13.56) Down 200 6.32 (0.36) (7.92) Down 100 5.96 2.74 (1.14) Up 100 (1.55) 1.09 4.57 Up 200 (6.25) (1.13) 5.76 Up 300 (9.48) (1.89) 8.41 Typical rate shock analysis does not reflect management s ability to react and thereby reduce the effect of rate changes, and represents a worst-case scenario. Liquidity Risk Liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers, and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. Generally the Corporation relies on deposits, loan repayments and repayments of investment securities as its primary sources of funds. The Corporation has 14.4 million of investments that mature throughout the next 12 months. The Corporation also anticipates 131.9 million of principal payments from mortgage-backed and other securities. Given the current rate environment, the Corporation anticipates 26.9 million in securities to be called within the next 12 months. The Corporation also has 346.3 million of unused borrowing capacity available with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, 378.9 million available with the Federal Reserve Bank, and 125 million of available fed funds lines with correspondent banks. With these sources of funds, the Corporation currently anticipates adequate liquidity to meet the expected obligations of its customers. Financial Condition Comparing the first nine months of 2024 to year-ended December 31, 2023, loans net of deferred loan costs, have increased 547 million to 3.7 billion. Deposits increased 15.3 to 4.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Other borrowings decreased 78.1 million to 30.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Shareholders equity increased 7.19 or 38.0 million. This financial performance increased book value per share 7.08 to 47.93 at September 30, 2024 from 44.76 at December 31, 2023. Book value per share is calculated by dividing the total shareholders equity by the number of shares outstanding. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased 24.3 million primarily due to the market value of the securities portfolio, which reflected the increase in securities pricing.

 Capital Adequacy The Federal Reserve, OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, joint agencies) establish regulatory capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. Regulatory capital guidelines require that capital be measured in relation to the credit and market risks of both on- and off-balance sheet items using various risk weights. On January 1, 2015, the Basel 3 rules became effective and include transition provisions through January 1, 2019. Under Basel 3, Total capital consists of two tiers of capital, Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 capital is further composed of Common equity tier 1 capital and additional tier 1 capital. Common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes qualifying common shareholders equity, retained earnings and certain minority interests. Goodwill, disallowed intangible assets and certain disallowed deferred tax assets are excluded from Common equity tier 1 capital. Additional tier 1 capital primarily includes qualifying non-cumulative preferred stock, trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) subject to phase-out and certain minority interests. Certain deferred tax assets are also excluded. Tier 2 capital primarily consists of qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, Trust Securities subject to phase-out and reserves for unfunded lending commitments. The Corporation s Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. To meet adequately capitalized regulatory requirements, an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.50 percent and a Total capital ratio of 10.50 percent. A well-capitalized institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines. The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. BHCs must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent. National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent to be classified as well capitalized. Failure to meet the capital requirements established by the joint agencies can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial position. Below are the capital ratios for the Corporation and lead bank. The fully phased in capital conservation buffer set the minimum ratios for common equity Tier 1 capital at 7 , the Tier 1 capital at 8.5 and the total capital at 10.5 . Currently the Corporation exceeds all of these minimums.
