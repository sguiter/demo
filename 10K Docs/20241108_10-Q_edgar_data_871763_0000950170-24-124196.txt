or more of the respective carrying amounts, was sufficient to conclude that no impairment was indicated. While the excess of fair value over carrying amount exceeded for our reporting units, we did see a lower level of excess cushion year over year in many of our North America and Europe reporting units. Given the current macroeconomic conditions in these regions, our assumptions on near-term expected future revenue growth rates and operating profit margins were lower than in the prior year assessment. Market conditions in North America and Europe continue to remain challenging given the economic uncertainty including the uncertainty surrounding the timing of an inflection point for improving market conditions. Management closely monitors the results of the reporting units and comparisons to the key assumptions used in our fair value estimate at the time of our annual impairment test, in addition to operational initiatives and macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the results of the reporting units. There could be significant further decreases in the operating results of our reporting units for a sustained period, which may result in a recognition of goodwill impairment that could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied to applicable contract modifications through . The adoption of this guidance has not had any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, and we do not expect it to have a going forward. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2023, the FASB issued new on segment reporting. The guidance requires an annual and interim disclosure of significant segment expenses that are (1) regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and (2) included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. The guidance also allows companies to disclose multiple measures of segment profit or loss if those measures are used to assess performance and allocate resources. The new guidance is effective for our 2024 annual disclosures and subsequent quarters, and should be adopted retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued a final standard on improvements to income tax disclosures. The guidance requires that public entities on an annual basis disclose disaggregated information about the rate reconciliation as well as income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for our 2025 annual disclosures and will be adopted prospectively. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The changes in fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts derivatives are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying operating expense is recognized in earnings. On June 9, 2022, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of and a fixed rate of , which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our anticipated issuance of notes to repay our existing notes maturing in September 2022 . Upon the issuance of the notes on June 30, 2022, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a gain of , which was recorded in AOCI and is being amortized over the term of the notes as an offset to interest expense.

We expect the net amount of pre-tax derivative gains included in AOCI at September 30, 2024 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months will not be significant. The actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12 months will vary due to future currency exchange rates. Fair Value Hedges We account for derivatives as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. We use cross currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of our foreign currency denominated intercompany notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We record the change in carrying value of the foreign currency denominated notes due to changes in exchange rates into earnings each period. The changes in fair value of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income OCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the change in fair value attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In March 2022, we entered into a cross currency swap agreement to hedge an intercompany fixed-rate CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. On April 18, 2024, we settled the swaps at maturity for a net cash inflow of and entered into a new cross currency swap with a maturity date of April 2027. The cross currency swaps convert our intercompany fixed-rate CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment and the payment of remaining principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. The economic effect of the swaps is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at with a fixed annual interest rate of . In September 2022, we entered into a cross currency swap agreement to hedge an intercompany fixed-rate CHF denominated note, including the annual interest payment, to a fixed-rate Euro denominated note. On September 26, 2024, we settled the swaps at maturity for a net cash inflow of and entered into a new cross currency swap with a maturity date of September 2027. The economic effect of the swaps is to eliminate the uncertainty of cash flows in CHF associated with the note by fixing the principal at with a fixed annual interest rate of .

We assessed the hedging relationship at the inception of the hedges in order to determine whether the derivatives that are used in the transaction are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged item, and will continue to assess the relationship on an ongoing basis. We use the hypothetical derivative method in conjunction with regression analysis using a third-party valuation to measure effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements and our forward currency exchange contracts. Non-designated instruments We also use certain derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments, as economic hedges of foreign currency and interest rate exposure. For our forward contracts that are not designated as hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the change in fair value is recognized in current period earnings. These gains or losses are offset by the exposure related to receivables and payables with our foreign subsidiaries and to interest due on our Euro-denominated notes, which is paid annually in June and September.

Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value, except for the Euro-denominated notes, because the interest rates are variable and reflect current market rates. The fair value of the Euro-denominated notes, as observable at commonly quoted intervals (Level 2 inputs), was .9 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to a carrying value of and , respectively. Our deferred compensation plan assets, included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We determine the fair value of these assets, comprised of publicly traded securities, by using market quotes as of the last day of the period (Level 1 inputs). We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps at the value based on either directly or indirectly observable inputs from third parties (Level 2 inputs).

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a "forward-looking statement"). Statements made in this quarterly report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on management s current assumptions and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, may, believe, seek, estimate, and other similar expressions. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2023, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions, particularly in Europe, including inflation, geopolitical risk and uncertainty; changes in labor and tax legislation in places we do business; failure to implement strategic transformation initiatives and technology investments; and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our SEC filings or otherwise. We caution that any forward-looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
 Business Overview 
 Our business is cyclical in nature and is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions generally. Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the segments where we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. During periods of decreased demand, as we continued to experience in the third quarter of 2024, our operating profit is generally impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of selling and administrative expenses, which may not decline at the same pace as revenues. By contrast, during periods of increased demand, we are generally able to improve our profitability and operating leverage as our cost base can support some increase in business without a similar increase in selling and administrative expenses. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we continued to observe decreased demand for staffing services and permanent recruitment services primarily due to continued economic uncertainty, and we expect this trend to continue. The economic uncertainty is particularly high in Europe and the United States. Inflation has eased in Europe and the United States resulting in both markets reducing interest rates during the quarter. However, employers are continuing their cautious approach with many employers retaining their current workforce, delaying hiring decisions or reducing their demand for contingent labor as they remain focused on managing the macro-economic and geopolitical challenges impacting their businesses. Many employers are still hesitant to increase their spend and expand their workforce until they perceive a significant improvement in economic outlook. As a result of these factors, we expect the business environment will continue to be challenging, which could further negatively impact our operations in future periods. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the United States dollar was generally stable, on average, relative to the currencies in most of our markets, and overall had a slight unfavorable impact on our reported results. The changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a -1.3 unfavorable impact on revenues from services and an approximately 0.03 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share diluted in the quarter. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same local currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. To understand the performance of our underlying business, we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results. 
 23 

During the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a -5.5 revenue decrease in the Americas, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and decreased demand for our Experis interim services, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services and increased demand for Talent Based Outsourcing (TBO). During the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a -0.6 revenue decrease in Southern Europe, primarily due to decreased demand for our Manpower staffing services and decreased demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. During the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a -9.4 revenue decrease in Northern Europe, primarily due to a decreased demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, decreased demand for our Experis Solutions services, and decreased demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and increased demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. We experienced a -0.3 revenue decrease in APME in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and decreased demand for TBO and decreased demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by increased demand for our Manpower staffing services. 
 From a brand perspective, we experienced revenue decreases in Manpower and Experis and a revenue increase in Talent Solutions in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. In our Manpower brand, the revenue decrease was primarily due to decreased demand for staffing services and our permanent recruitment services. The revenue decrease in our Experis brand was primarily due to decreased demand for interim services, our Experis Solutions services and our permanent recruitment services. On an overall basis, the revenue increase in our Talent Solutions brand, which includes RPO, MSP and our Right Management offerings, was primarily due an increase in demand for our Right Management outplacement services and our MSP business, partially offset by decreased demand for our RPO permanent recruitment offerings. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, our gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to declines in our higher-margin permanent recruitment business and mix shifts and lower volumes in our staffing/interim businesses, partially offset by growth in our higher-margin Talent Solutions outplacement business. 
 Our operating profit increased 1.5 in the third quarter of 2024 while our operating profit margin increased 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating profit increased primarily due to a reduction in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, a reduction in corporate expense related to incentives and certain other health plan trends, and lower restructuring charges.

The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of -3.1 (-1.8 in constant currency and -1.7 in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 
 a revenue decrease in the Americas of -5.5 (increase of 1.5 in constant currency) primarily driven by the 77.8 million unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates and a 45.8 million decrease in demand for our Experis interim services, partially offset by a 66.0 million increase in demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 7.7 million increase in demand for TBO. The United States, our largest market in the Americas, experienced a revenue decrease of -4.5 primarily driven by a 33.4 million decrease in demand for our Experis interim services; 

a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of -0.6 (-1.3 in constant currency) primarily driven by a 24.6 million decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services and a 5.4 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by the 14.7 million favorable impact of currency exchange rates and a 6.1 million increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. France, the largest market in Southern Europe, experienced a revenue decrease of -2.5 (-3.3 in constant currency) primarily driven by a 44.9 million decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by the 9.6 million favorable impact of currency exchange rates and a 5.3 million increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. Italy, our second-largest market in Southern Europe, experienced a revenue increase of 1.3 (0.5 in constant currency) primarily driven by the 3.5 million favorable impact of currency exchange rates and a 1.3 million increase in demand for TBO, partially offset by a 1.7 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services; 

a revenue decrease in Northern Europe of -9.4 (-11.0 in constant currency) primarily driven by an 81.6 million decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, a 21.0 million decrease in demand for our Experis solutions services and an 8.5 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by the 15.0 million favorable impact of currency exchange rates and a 5.3 million increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. Within our Northern Europe segment, we experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom of 25.7 million, the Nordics of 31.8 million, Germany of 19.6 million and Belgium of 6.0 million, which represented revenue decreases of -8.1 , -20.0 , -14.0 and -6.9 , respectively (-10.5 , -19.0 , -14.8 and -7.9 , respectively, in constant currency). These decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in the Netherlands of 0.5 million, which represented a revenue increase of 0.6 (-0.4 in constant currency); and 

25 

a revenue decrease in APME of -0.3 (increase of 1.6 in constant currency and 3.0 in organic constant currency) primarily driven by the 11.1 million unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, a 7.5 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services and a 9.0 million decrease in demand for TBO, partially offset by a 26.8 million increase in demand for our Manpower staffing services. 

The year-over-year 30 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: 
 a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from decreases to permanent recruitment, including Talent Solutions RPO, as permanent hiring demand continued to soften and experienced reduced levels; 

a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from the decrease in staffing/interim margins due to mix shifts and lower volumes while pricing remained stable; and 

a 10 basis point unfavorable impact due to the effects of currency exchange rates; partially offset by 

a 10 basis point favorable impact from increased career transition activity in Right Management as outplacement activity increased. 

The -5.4 decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 (-4.4 in constant currency and -4.3 in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: 
 a 16.1 million, or -3.3 decrease (-2.1 in constant currency) in personnel costs primarily due to an 8.0 million decrease in bonuses and sales commission costs and a 4.9 million decrease in salaries as we saw the effects of restructuring actions taken in 2023; 

a 12.2 million, or -5.7 decrease (-5.0 in constant currency) in non-personnel costs primarily due to a 13.2 million decrease in office lease and other office costs; 

a 7.5 million, or -1.2 decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and 

the 37.6 million of restructuring costs, incurred in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 38.1 million incurred in the third quarter of 2023. 

Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 40 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to: 
 a 30 basis point favorable impact as non-personnel costs decreased as a percent of revenues primarily due to percent of revenue decreases in office leases and other office costs; and 

a 10 basis point favorable impact as a result of the decrease in restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

26 

Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including those associated with noncontrolling interests. Interest expense, net was 16.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 13.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased revolver and other short-term borrowings during the period. Foreign exchange loss, net was 1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a reduction in foreign currency exchange losses year over year. Miscellaneous income, net was 6.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 61.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an effective rate of 44.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 rate was unfavorably impacted by the lower level and overall mix of earnings, a discrete valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in Sweden, and a 2023 rate that included benefits from the effective settlement of an income tax audit. The higher 2024 rate was partially offset by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.38 to 0.28 effective January 1, 2024. The 61.5 effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowance, the French business tax, and the overall mix of earnings. 
 Net earnings per share - diluted was 0.47 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.60 in the third quarter of 2023. Restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2024 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately 0.82, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2024. Restructuring costs recorded in the third quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately 0.68, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 48.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 50.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by grants of share-based awards.

The year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of -5.8 (-3.6 in constant currency and -3.4 in organic constant currency) was attributed to: 
 a revenue decrease in the Americas of -5.7 (increase of 1.8 in constant currency) primarily driven by the 247.9 million unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, a 116.3 million decrease in demand for our Experis interim services and a 10.2 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by a 158.8 million increase in demand for our Manpower staffing services, a 17.3 million increase in demand for TBO and an 8.2 million increase in 

27 

demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. The United States, our largest market in the Americas, experienced a revenue decrease of -4.9 primarily driven by a 100.7 million decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services and a 12.2 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by a 7.1 million increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services; 

a revenue decrease in Southern Europe of -3.6 (-3.5 in constant currency) primarily driven by a 220.8 million decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, a 17.5 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services and a 4.8 million decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis solutions services, partially offset by a 13.1 million increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. France, the largest market in Southern Europe, experienced a revenue decrease of -4.7 (-5.0 in constant currency) primarily driven by a 185.3 million decrease in demand for our Manpower staffing services, partially offset by an 11.8 million increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement services. Italy, our second-largest market in Southern Europe, experienced a revenue decrease of -2.7 (-3.0 in constant currency) primarily driven by a 37.3 million decrease in our Manpower staffing services and a 5.3 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by a 3.9 million increase in demand for TBO; 

a revenue decrease in Northern Europe of -10.5 (-11.7 in constant currency) primarily driven by a 264.2 million decrease in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services, a 60.2 million decrease in demand for our Experis solutions services and a 26.9 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services, partially offset by the 34.6 million favorable impact of currency exchange rates and a 9.5 million increase in demand for our Talent Solutions outplacement and MSP services. Within our Northern Europe segment, we experienced revenue decreases in the United Kingdom of 98.6 million, the Nordics of 133.6 million, Germany of 52.9 million, the Netherlands of 5.2 million and Belgium of 6.6 million, which represented revenue decreases of -10.0 , -21.6 , -12.5 , -1.8 and -2.8 , respectively (-12.3 , -21.2 , -12.8 , -2.1 and -3.1 , respectively, in constant currency); and 

a revenue decrease in APME of -7.4 (-1.8 in constant currency and -0.5 in organic constant currency) primarily driven by the 99.0 million unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates, a 53.4 million decrease in demand for our permanent recruitment services and a 19.4 million decrease in demand for our TBO, partially offset by a 43.8 million increase in demand for our Manpower and Experis staffing/interim services. 

The year-over-year 50 basis point decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributed to: 
 a 50 basis point unfavorable impact from decreases to permanent recruitment, including Talent Solutions RPO, as permanent hiring demand continued to soften and experienced reduced levels; and 

a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from the decrease in staffing/interim margins due to mix shifts and lower volumes while pricing remained stable; partially offset by 

a 20 basis point favorable impact from increased career transition activity in Right Management as outplacement activity increased. 

28 

The -7.0 decrease in selling and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2024 (-5.4 in constant currency and -5.2 in organic constant currency) was primarily attributed to: 
 a 61.1 million, or -5.7 decrease (-4.1 in constant currency) in personnel costs primarily due to a 39.8 million decrease in salary costs as we saw the effects of restructuring actions taken in 2023; 

a 37.3 million, or -1.6 decrease due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; 

restructuring costs of 37.6 million, in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 59.2 million incurred in the first nine months of 2023; and 

a 22.2 million, or -5.1 decrease (-3.4 in constant currency) in non-personnel costs, primarily due to an 8.0 million decrease in office lease and other office costs and a 5.2 million decrease in consulting and outside services costs associated with our technology and back-office transformation initiatives. 

Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues decreased 20 basis points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to: 
 a 20 basis point favorable impact as a result of lower restructuring costs incurred in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023; and 

a 10 basis point favorable impact as personnel costs as a percent of revenue decreased, primarily due to a percent of revenue decrease in salaries as we saw the effects of restructuring actions taken in 2023; partially offset by 

a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates. 

Interest and other expenses, net is comprised of interest, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses, including those associated with noncontrolling interests. Interest expense, net was 42.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 35.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to increased revolver and other short-term borrowings at a higher interest rate during the period. Foreign exchange loss, net was 5.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 14.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a reduction in foreign currency exchange losses year over year. Miscellaneous income, net was 19.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 15.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 41.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an effective rate of 33.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 rate was unfavorably impacted by the lower level and overall mix of earnings, a discrete valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in Sweden, and a 2023 rate that included benefits from the effective settlement of an income tax audit. The higher 2024 rate was partially offset by the scheduled reduction in the French business tax rate from 0.38 to 0.28 effective January 1, 2024. The 41.4 effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the United States Federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to tax losses in certain countries for which we did not recognize a corresponding tax benefit due to valuation allowances, the French business tax, and the overall mix of earnings. 
 Net earnings per share - diluted was 2.53 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 3.42 in the first nine months of 2023. Restructuring costs recorded in the first nine months of 2024 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately 0.82, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2024. Losses related to our Proservia Germany wind down in the first nine months of 2024 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately 0.19, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2024. Restructuring costs recorded in the first nine months of 2023 unfavorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately 1.00, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Weighted average shares - diluted decreased to 48.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 50.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. This decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed since the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by grants of share-based awards.

Financ ial Measures 
 Constant Currency and Organic Constant Currency Reconciliation 
 Changes in our financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and dispositions. We provide constant currency and organic constant currency calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items. We express year-over-year variances that are calculated in constant currency and organic constant currency as a percentage. 
 When we use the term constant currency, it means that we have translated financial data for a period into United States dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period. We believe that this calculation is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth or decline of our operations. We use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance, including Argentina which operates in a hyperinflationary economy. We also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors. Substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and, consequently, do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated. 
 When we use the term organic constant currency, it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation. We believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth or decline of our ongoing business. 
 The constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). These Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances, along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results, are provided below:

(a) In millions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash used to fund our operations is primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. We believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We assess and monitor our liquidity and capital resources globally. We use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate our capital resources among our various entities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 345.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the United States from certain foreign subsidiaries to fund domestic operations. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 61.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 234.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized 155.8 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 42.1 million utilized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These changes were primarily attributable to the timing of collections and payments. Accounts receivable decreased to 4,592.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from 4,830.0 million as of December 31, 2023 primarily due to the revenue decline and the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Days Sales Outstanding ("DSO") increased by three days from December 31, 2023 to 57 days as of September 30, 2024. 
 The nature of our operations is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable and our most significant current liabilities are payroll-related costs, which are generally paid either weekly or monthly. As the demand for our services increases, we generally experience an increase in our working capital needs, as we continue to pay our associates on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable are outstanding for much longer, which may result in a decline in operating cash flows. 
 Conversely, as the demand for our services declines, we generally experience a decrease in our working capital needs, as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level, resulting in a decline of our accounts receivable balance, with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items. While this may result in an increase in our operating cash flows, longer payment terms and timing of payroll, tax and supplier-related payments significantly impact our cash position and cash flows each period. Any increase in operating cash flows from an economic slowdown would not be sustained in the event that a downturn continues for an extended period, as we are seeing in the current economic cycle. 
 36 

Capital expenditures were 39.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 55.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These expenditures were primarily comprised of purchases of computer equipment, office furniture and other costs related to office openings and refurbishments, as well as capitalized software costs. The lower expenditures in 2024 compared to 2023 are primarily due to the timing of the expenditures. 
 From time to time, we acquire and invest in companies throughout the world, including franchises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was 7.7 million, which represents a consideration payment for a franchise in the United States and contingent consideration payment related to a previous acquisition. No cash consideration was paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Occasionally, we dispose of parts of our operations based on risk considerations and to optimize our global strategic and geographic footprint and overall efficiency. On September 29, 2023, we disposed of our Philippines business in our APME segment for total consideration of 6.5 million. In connection with the disposition, we recognized a one-time net loss on disposition of 1.3 million. 
 Net borrowings were 13.3 million as compared to net debt repayments of 13.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Our 500.0 million notes and 400.0 million notes are due June 2026 and June 2027, respectively. When those notes mature, we plan to either repay the amounts with available cash or borrowings under our 600.0 million revolving credit facility or a new borrowing. The credit terms, including interest rate and facility fees, of any replacement borrowings will be dependent upon the condition of the credit markets at that time. We currently do not anticipate any problems accessing the credit markets for replacement of those notes. 
 Our 600.0 million revolving credit agreement requires that we comply with a leverage ratio (Net Debt-to-Net Earnings before interest and other expenses, provision for income taxes, intangible asset amortization expense, depreciation and amortization expense ("EBITDA")) of not greater than 3.5 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1. As defined in the agreement, we had a Net Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.48 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.21 to 1 as of September 30, 2024. Based on our current forecast, we expect to be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had letters of credit of 0.4 million issued under our 600.0 million revolving credit facility, as well as 9.0 million drawn under our uncommitted credit facility. We made those borrowings in order to fund our working capital needs. Additional borrowings of 599.6 million were available to us under our 600.0 million revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition to the previously mentioned facilities, we maintain separate bank credit lines with financial institutions to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiary operations. As of September 30, 2024, such uncommitted credit lines totaled 312.1 million, of which 294.8 million was unused. Under the revolving credit agreement, total subsidiary borrowings cannot exceed 300.0 million in the first, second and fourth quarters, and 600.0 million in the third quarter of each year. 
 We have assessed our liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 and for the near future. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 410.9 million. We also have access to the previously mentioned revolving credit facility that could have immediately provided us with up to 600.0 million of additional cash, less any outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, and we have an option to request an increase to the total availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional 300.0 million and each lender may participate in the requested increase at their discretion. In addition, we have access to the previously mentioned credit lines to meet the working capital needs of our subsidiaries, of which 294.8 million was available to use as of September 30, 2024. Our 500.0 555.5) million notes mature in June 2026, and our 400.0 442.7) million notes mature in June 2027. Based on the above, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations currently and in the near future.

The Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of 1.54 and 1.47 per share on May 3, 2024 and May 5, 2023, respectively. The 2024 dividends were paid on June 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of June 3, 2024. The 2023 dividends were paid on June 15, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2023. 
 
 In August 2023 and August 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 5.0 million shares and 4.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively. We conduct share repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, block transactions, privately negotiated transactions or similar facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares under the 2023 authorization at a cost of 106.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares under the 2021 authorization at a cost of 129.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, there were 3.1 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2023 authorization and no shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2021 authorization. 
 We had aggregate commitments of 2,202.3 million as of September 30, 2024 related to debt, operating leases, severance and office closure costs, transition tax resulting from the Tax Act and certain other commitments compared to 2,320.5 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 We also have entered into guarantee contracts and stand-by letters of credit totaling 694.1 million and 745.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively 647.3 million and 696.9 million for guarantees as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 46.8 and 48.8 million for stand-by letters of credit, respectively). The guarantees primarily relate to staffing license requirements, operating leases and indebtedness. The stand-by letters of credit mainly relate to workers compensation in the United States. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy our obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments. The cost of these guarantees and letters of credit were 1.1 million and 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 37.6 million in restructuring costs. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 38.1 million and 59.2 million, respectively, in restructuring costs. Payments made from the restructuring reserve were 19.7 million and 70.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We use our restructuring reserve for severance, office closures, office consolidations, and professional and other fees related to restructuring in multiple countries and territories.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
 In accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill, we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at our reporting unit level during the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below carrying value. 
 Estimated cash flows and goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level, which the company has determined to be a component of the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the reporting results. 
 We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows to which the goodwill relates. This approach reflects management s internal outlook of the reporting units, which is believed to be the best determination of value due to management s insight and experience with the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2024 included: expected future revenue growth rates, operating unit profit margins, working capital levels, discount rates, and a terminal value multiple. The expected future revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins were determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and operating unit profit margins, our assessment of future market potential, and our expectations of future business performance. 
 We believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based on the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and is consistent with our view of how market participants would value the company s reporting units in an orderly transaction. 
 In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value. 
 We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill during the third quarter of 2024 and there was no impairment of our goodwill. Refer to Note 1 for results of our annual goodwill impairment testing.
