NOTE
1 GENERAL (continued) 

C. 
 Going
 concern uncertainty 

Since
inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit of 
million. The Company has financed its operations mainly through financing by the issuance of the Company s equity from various
investors. 

The
Company s management expects that the Company will continue to generate losses and negative cash flows from operations for the
foreseeable future. Based on the projected cash flows and cash balances as of September 30, 2024, management currently is of the opinion
that its existing cash will be sufficient to fund operations until the end of the third quarter of 2025. As a result, there is substantial
doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management
endeavors to secure sufficient financing through the sale of additional equity securities or capital inflows from strategic partnerships.
Additional funds may not be available when the Company needs them, on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company is unsuccessful in securing
sufficient financing, it may need to cease operations. 

The
financial statements do not include adjustments for measurement or presentation of assets and liabilities, which may be required should
the Company fail to operate as a going concern. 

D. 
 Israel
 Hamas war 

Because
most of the Company s operations are conducted in Israel and all members of its board of directors, management, as well as a majority
of its employees and consultants, including employees of its service providers, are located in Israel, its business and operations are
directly affected by economic, political, geopolitical and military conditions affecting Israel. 

In
October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on
civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located
along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive
deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians and soldiers in the southern part of the country. Following the attack, Israel s
security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to
their continued rocket and terror attacks. Following the attack by Hamas on Israel s southern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon
also launched missile, rocket, drone and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites, troops and Israeli towns in northern
Israel. In October 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. In addition, Iran recently
launched direct attacks on Israel and has threatened to continue to attack Israel. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among
extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in
Syria and Iraq. While currently no damages were registered in
Israel from such attacks, the situation is developing and could lead to additional wars and hostilities in the Middle East. It is
possible that the hostilities with Hezbollah and Iran will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including Palestinian
military organizations in the West Bank, as well as other hostile countries, will join the hostilities. Such hostilities may include
terror and missile attacks. In the event that the Company s facilities are damaged as a result of hostile actions, or
hostilities otherwise disrupt its ongoing operations, its ability to deliver or provide products and services in a timely manner
to meet its contractual obligations to customers and vendors could be materially and adversely affected.

NOTE
1 GENERAL (continued) 

Following
the brutal attacks on Israel, the mobilization of army reserves and the government declaring a state of war in October 2023, there was
a decrease in Israel s economic and business activity. The security situation has led, among other things, to a disruption in the
supply chain and production, a decrease in the volume of national transportation, and a shortage in manpower due to employees being called
for active reserve duty as well as a rise in the exchange rate of foreign currencies in relation to the New Israel Shekel. These events
may imply wider macroeconomic indications of a deterioration of Israel s economic standing, which may have a material adverse effect
on the Company and its ability to effectively conduct its business, operations and affairs. Although many of such military reservists
have since been released, they may be called up for additional reserve duty, depending on developments in the war in Gaza and along Israel s
other borders. Certain of its employees and consultants in Israel, in addition to employees of its service providers located in Israel,
have been called, and additional employees may be called, for service in the current or future wars or other armed conflicts with Hamas
as well as the other pending or future armed conflicts in which Israel is or may become engaged, and such persons may be absent for an
extended period of time. 

Save
Foods Ltd. has experienced delays in pilots and packaging activities due to the war, as certain packing houses, have halted operations
for the time being. Additionally, the Company anticipated engaging additional packing houses to conduct pilots with the Company s
product, but, due to the war, the Company was unable to continue pursuing new collaborations for these pilots, and the Company may not
be able to resume any potential collaborations if the current war persists for an extended duration. The Company is unable to predict
how long the current conflict will last, as well as the repercussions these delays will have on operations. If the Company is unable
to renew pilots or collaborations with local packing houses, the Company s financial results may be affected. 

Plantify
has facilities in Kibbutz Gonen, which is located in an area in northern Israel that has been affected by ongoing hostilities with Hezbollah
in Lebanon. Due to the continuous drone attacks, missile strikes and shootings in the
region, the area has been almost completely evacuated of civilians. All employees were put on unpaid leave until further notice and Plantify
has ceased its operations, and may not be able to resume its regular activities, including its ability to deliver products to customers
in a timely manner, if the hostilities persist for an extended period. 

The
Company is continuing to regularly follow developments on the matter and is examining the effects on its operations and the value of
its assets.

the equity method, the Company applies it to all its financial interests in the same entity (equity and debt, including guarantees) that
are eligible items. 

The
equity investment in common shares of Plantify is classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation can be obtained
from real time quotes in active markets, and is measured based on Plantify s closing stock price and prevailing foreign exchange
rate at each balance sheet date and the changes in fair value are reflected in gain (loss) on equity investments, net in the consolidated
statement of income.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion
of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed
below. 

Overview 

We
are an agri-food tech company specializing in eco crop protection that helps reduce food waste and ensure food safety while reducing
the use of pesticides. We develop eco-friendly green solutions for the food industry. Our solutions are developed to improve
the food safety and shelf life of fresh produce. We do this by controlling human and plant pathogens, thereby reducing spoilage, and
in turn, reducing food loss. 

We
operate through our two majority-owned Israeli subsidiaries, Save Foods Ltd., which focuses on post-harvest treatments in fruit and vegetables
to control and prevent pathogen contamination, significantly reduce the use of hazardous chemicals and prolong fresh produce s
shelf life, and NTWO OFF Ltd., formerly known as Nitrousink Ltd. NTWO OFF ), which offers a pioneering solution to mitigate
N O (nitrous oxide) emissions, a potent greenhouse gas with 310 times the global warming impact of carbon dioxide. Through NTWO
OFF we aim to promote agricultural practices that are both environmentally friendly and economically viable and to become a global leader
in this field by collaborating with or acquiring other companies that create innovative solutions and tools to solve other aspects of
global warming s impact of carbon dioxide. In addition, we currently own approximately 23 of Plantify Foods Inc. Plantify ),
a Canadian-based food tech company focused on the development and production of clean-label, plant-based food products. 

Our
solutions are based on our proprietary blend of food acids combined with certain types of oxidizing agent-based sanitizers and in some
cases with fungicides at low concentrations. Our products have a synergistic effect when combined with these oxidizing agent-based sanitizers
and fungicides. Our green solutions are capable of cleaning, sanitizing and controlling pathogens on fresh produce with
the goal of making them safer for human consumption and extending their shelf life by reducing their decay. One of the main advantages
of our products is that our ingredients do not leave any toxicological residues on the fresh produce we treat. By forming a temporary
protective shield around the fresh produce we treat, our solutions make it difficult for pathogens to develop and potentially provide
protection which also reduces cross-contamination. 

Additionally, we collaborate with Solterra Renewable Energy Ltd. Solterra in connection with certain investment opportunities in solar PV (photovoltaic) projects. These investment opportunities have included
projects in Melz, Germany, where we, together with other investors, lent an aggregate amount of 2.08 million. We continue to collaborate
with Solterra as Solterra surveys the European solar energy market for additional projects.

the Lender a five-year warrant (the Warrant to purchase 1,850,000 shares of its common stock (the Warrant Shares ),
with an exercise price of 1.00 per share. Such warrant may not be exercised by the Lender if such exercise would result in the Lender
beneficially owning in excess of 4.99 of our outstanding shares. The Warrant Shares are immediately exercisable. Furthermore, the exercise
price and number of Warrant Shares are subject to adjustments upon the issuance of common stock, issuance of options, issuance of convertible
securities and stock combination events, as detailed in the Warrant. 

In the event we fail to deliver
the Warrant Shares in a timely manner and the Lender is required to purchase shares of common stock in the open market to cover a sale
of the Warrant Shares, we will be required to compensate the Lender for any additional costs incurred. The Warrant Shares additionally
have a cashless exercise mechanism in the event a registration statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares is not available, based
on a specified formula as detailed in the Warrant. 

If we do not have sufficient authorized
and unreserved shares of common stock to cover the exercise of the Warrant, we will be required to obtain stockholder approval within
sixty days to increase its authorized shares. If we cannot deliver the required common stock upon exercise, the Lender will be entitled
to demand cash compensation based on the Black Scholes Value of the Warrant. 

The Lender is entitled to certain
purchase rights with respect to Warrant Shares which the Lender could have acquired upon the exercise of the Warrant. We may not enter
into a fundamental transaction, as described in the Warrant, unless the successor entity assumes our obligations under the Warrant. The
Lender may also request that we buy back the Warrant calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model in cash. 

Pursuant
to the Facility Agreement, we must file a resale registration statement with SEC within 75 days of the date of the Facility Agreement
to register the Warrant Shares and must use reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective by the SEC within
90 days of filing.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable
and accounts payable and capital expenditures. Since our inception through September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations, principally
with the issuance of equity and debt. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2,749,851, as compared to 1,934,634 as of September 30, 2023. As of September
30, 2024, we had working capital of 2,853,704, as compared to 2,211,582 as of September 30, 2023. The increase in our cash balance is
mainly attributable to proceeds from our standby equity purchase agreement. 

On
August 18, 2022, we issued an aggregate of 228,572 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 21.00 per share in an underwritten
offering for gross proceeds of approximately 4,800,000. In connection therewith, we granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase
up to 34,286 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price of 21.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions
solely to cover over-allotments and issued ThinkEquity LLC a five-year warrant to purchase up to 11,429 shares of common stock, at a
per share exercise price equal to 125 of the offering price per share of common stock. 

On
July 23, 2023, we entered into a standby equity purchase agreement with YA II PN, Ltd. (the Investor ), pursuant to which
the Investor agreed to purchase up to 3,500,000 shares of our common stock for 40 months from the date of the purchase agreement at
a price per share equal to 94 of the lowest volume-weighted average price VWAP of our common stock for the three days
prior to the delivery of each advance notice from us, subject to certain limitations, including that the Investor cannot purchase a number
of shares that would result in it beneficially owning more than 4.99 of our outstanding shares of common stock . In December 2023, we
raised an aggregate of 3,500,000 under the standby equity purchase agreement. 

28 

On
December 22, 2023, we entered into an additional standby equity purchase agreement with the Investor, pursuant to which the Investor
has agreed to purchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock for 36 months from the date of the purchase agreement at a price
per share equal to 94 of the lowest VWAP of our common stock for the three trading days immediately following the delivery of each advance
notice from us. The agreement will terminate automatically on the earlier of January 1, 2027, or when the Investor has purchased an aggregate
of 20 million of our shares of common stock. We have the right to terminate the purchase agreement upon five trading days prior
written notice to the Investor. As of November 14, 2024, we have sold an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of common stock at an average
purchase price of 0.47 per share to the Investor. The maximum number of shares allowed to be issued under the Company s
registration statement is 6,666,667 shares of common stock. 

In
connection with and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the standby equity purchase agreement, upon our request,
the Investor will pre advance to us up to 3,000,000 of the 20,000,000 commitment amount (a Pre-Advance ), with each Pre-Advance
to be evidenced by a promissory note issued at a 3 discount to the principal amount equal to each such note. Each note accrues interest
on the outstanding principal balance at the rate of 8 per annum. The Company is required to pay, on a monthly basis, one tenth of the
outstanding principal amount of each note, together with accrued and unpaid interest, either (i) in cash or (ii) by submitting an advance
notice pursuant to the purchase agreement and selling the Investor shares of our common stock, or any combination thereof as determined
by us. The initial payment is due 60 days after the issuance of a note, and every 30 days thereafter. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Investor, any funds received by us pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of shares will first be used to satisfy any payments
due under an outstanding note. As of September 30, 2024, the note was repaid and extinguished. 

On
April 4, 2024, the Company issued the Investor an additional promissory note in the principal amount of 1,500,000 for proceeds of 1,455,000,
reflecting an original issue discount of 3 . 

On
October 1, 2024, we entered into the Facility Agreement for financing of up to EUR 6,000,000, as described above.

Going
Concern 

Since
our incorporation, we incurred losses from operations and net cash outflows from operating activities as disclosed in the consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 33 million, and we
expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have financed our operations mainly through financing from various investors and
have limited revenue from our products and therefore are dependent upon external sources to finance our operations. There can be no assurance
that we will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to continue our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern through at least twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report. 

We
believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our operating plan through the third quarter of 2025; however,
there can be no assurance of this. We will need to raise additional capital to support our operations through the issuance of debt, equity,
or a combination thereof. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital on favorable terms, or at
all. 

As
a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional
capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned development, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating
results. If we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders
may experience additional dilution, and we may issue securities with rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. If
we issue debt securities, there may be negative covenants which may restrict our activities. If adequate funds are not available to us
when needed on satisfactory terms, we may be required to cease operating or otherwise modify our business strategy. The financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report do not include adjustments for measurement or presentation of assets and liabilities, which may be
required should we fail to operate as a going concern. 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 2,927,148 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,258,869 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly attributable to a decrease in other liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable,
net. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 1,373,044 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing
activities of 1,519,559 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to our investment in Plantify in April 2023
partially offset by the investment in renewable energy projects and additional credit facility provided to Plantify, during the nine
months ended September, 2024. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 2,601,032 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0 net cash provided
by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is the result of proceeds from the standby equity
purchase agreement with the Investor entered into on December 22, 2023.

Item
1A. Risk Factors . 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed
in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024,
which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material
changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Risk Factors section of such Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Conditions
in Israel, including the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, and other conflicts in the region, may adversely affect our operations
and limit our ability to market our products, which would lead to a decrease in revenues. 

Because
a substantial part of our operations are conducted in Israel and all members of our board of directors, management, as well as a majority
of our employees and consultants, including employees of our service providers, are located in Israel, our business and operations are
directly affected by economic, political, geopolitical and military conditions affecting Israel. Any political instability, terrorism,
armed conflicts, reserve mobilization, cyberattacks, boycotts, direct or indirect sanctions and restrictions, or any other hostilities
involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations.
Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its neighboring
countries and other hostile non-state actors. These conflicts have involved missile strikes, hostile infiltrations and terrorism against
civilian targets in various parts of Israel, which have negatively affected business conditions in Israel. 

In
October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian
and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s
border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping
of civilians and soldiers, as well as evacuations of tens of thousands of civilians from their homes. Following the attack, Israel s
security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to their
continued rocket and terror attacks. Furthermore, hostilities along Israel s northern border with Hezbollah located in Lebanon
have accelerated, as a result of such, Israel has begun conducting a limited ground operation in southern Lebanon, which has the potential
to escalate into a wider regional conflict. In addition, Iran has directly targeted Israel with ballistic missiles and other weaponry. 

31 

The
intensity and duration of Israel s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, as are such war s economic implications
on our business and operations and on Israel s economy in general. These events may be intertwined with wider macroeconomic indications
of a deterioration of Israel s economic standing, for instance, a downgrade in Israel s credit rating by rating agencies
(such as the downgrade by Moody s of its credit rating of Israel from A1 to A2, as well as the downgrade of its outlook rating
from stable to negative followed by a second more recent downgrade from A2 to BAA1, and the S P Global
lowered its long-term credit rating from AA- to A+, as well as a downgrade of its short-term credit ratings from A-1+ to A-1, and recently,
further downgraded this rating to A-, with an outlook on the long-term ratings negative , as well as the downgrade by Fitch
Ratings of its credit rating of Israel from A+ to A, with an outlook rating of negative which may have a material adverse
effect on our company and our ability to effectively conduct its operations. 

Our
facilities are not only within the range of rockets from the Gaza Strip, but also within the range of rockets that can be fired from
Lebanon, Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East. In the event that our facilities are damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities
otherwise disrupt the ongoing operation of our facilities, our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner to meet our
contractual obligations with customers and vendors could be materially and adversely affected. 

Furthermore,
Plantify, in which we have an approximately 23 ownership interest, has facilities in Kibbutz Gonen, which is located in an area in
northern Israel that has been affected by ongoing hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon, as part of ongoing war. Due to the
continuous drone attacks, missile strikes, shootings and the limited ground operation in the region, the area has been completely
evacuated of civilians, following which all the employees were put on unpaid leave until further notice. Plantify has ceased its
operations at the Kibbutz Gonen facility and may not be able to resume its regular activities, including its ability to deliver
products to customers in a timely manner, if the hostilities persist for an extended period which may have an adverse effect on its
financial condition and ability to repay loans from us under a C 1,500,000 (approximately US 1,124,000) 8 debenture and a credit
facility of up to 250,000, of which, Plantify has fully utilized to date. 

We
have experienced delays in our pilots and packaging activities due to the war, as certain packing houses, such as Mehadrin, have halted
operations for the time being. Additionally, we anticipated engaging additional packing houses to conduct pilots on strawberries and
citruses with our product, but, due to the war, we were unable to continue pursuing new collaborations for these pilots, and we may not
be able to resume any potential collaborations if the current war persists for an extended duration. We are unable to predict how long
the current conflict will last, as well as the repercussions these delays will have on our operations. If we are unable to renew our
pilots or collaborations with local packing houses our financial results may be affected. 

Our
commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli
government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot
assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages
incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

As
a result of the Israeli security cabinet s decision to declare war against Hamas, and possible hostilities with other organizations,
several hundred thousand Israeli military reservists were drafted to perform immediate military service. Certain of our employees and
consultants in Israel and employees of our service providers located in Israel, have been called, and additional employees may be called,
for service in the current or future wars or other armed conflicts with Hamas, and such persons may be absent for an extended period
of time. Although we have certain manufacturing capabilities in the United States, our Israeli operations may be disrupted by such absences,
which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, the absence of employees of our Israeli
suppliers and contract manufacturers due to their military service in the current war or future wars or other armed conflicts may disrupt
their operations, which in turn may event our materially and adversely affect our ability to deliver or provide products and services
to customers. 

In
addition, popular uprisings in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa have affected the political stability of those countries.
Such instability may lead to a deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between the State of Israel and these
countries. Moreover, some countries around the world restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries
may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies if hostilities in Israel or political instability in the
region continues or increases. These restrictions may limit materially our ability to obtain raw materials from these countries or sell
our products to companies and customers in these countries.

Furthermore,
following Hamas attack on Israel and Israel s security cabinet declaration of war against Hamas, the Houthi movement, which
controls parts of Yemen, launched a number of attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red Sea, which marine vessels were thought to
either be in route towards Israel or to be partly owned by Israeli businessmen. The Red Sea is a vital maritime route for international
trade traveling to or from Israel. As a result of such disruptions, we may experience in the future delays in supplier deliveries, extended
lead times, and increased cost of freight, increased insurance costs, purchased materials and manufacturing labor costs. The risk of
ongoing supply disruptions may further result in delayed deliveries of our products. 

Prior
to the Hamas attack in October 2023, the Israeli government pursued extensive changes to Israel s judicial system, which sparked
extensive political debate and unrest. In response to such initiative, many individuals, organizations and institutions, both within
and outside of Israel, have voiced concerns that the proposed changes may negatively impact the business environment in Israel including
due to reluctance of foreign investors to invest or transact business in Israel as well as to increased currency fluctuations, downgrades
in credit rating, increased interest rates, increased volatility in security markets, and other changes in macroeconomic conditions.
The risk of such negative developments has increased in light of the recent Hamas attacks and the war against Hamas declared by Israel.
To the extent that any of these negative developments do occur, they may have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations
and our ability to raise additional funds, if deemed necessary by our management and board of directors. 

Our investment in the solar energy sector is
both for strategic and financial reasons but we may not realize a return on our investments. 

 We have made, and continue to seek to make, investments in the solar energy
sector, by and through our collaborate with Solterra, which we believe furthers our strategic objectives and support our key business
initiatives. We have thus far invested in certain solar energy projects in Europe and do not restrict ourselves from pursuing additional
investments in the solar energy sector. If any project in which we invest fails, we could lose all or part of our investment in that project.
If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for any such investment, we will have to write down the
investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. The performance of any of these investments could
result in significant impairment charges and gains (losses) on other equity investments. We must also analyze accounting and legal issues
when making these investments. If we do not structure these investments properly, we may be subject to certain unfavorable accounting
impact, such as potential consolidation of financial results. Furthermore, if the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved,
or if the investment diverges from our strategic objectives, we may seek to dispose of the investment. The occurrence of any of these
events could harm our results.
